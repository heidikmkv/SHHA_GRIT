       " 'bill passed both legislative chainbeis to reach the Governor for consideration. ~ · e sessions in even-numbered years are only 30 days Jong.\"\\'!lrne is short: so while the drive-llp\\' liquor window debate raged, precious time was norspenron the other important state mat- ters and issues; Drinking and driving is a priority of the highest level. however. not enough time was devoted~ the State\\'s Annual Budget, which is traditionally the forus of 30 day legislative sessions. Thus the budget that passed the House and Senate thi5 year ha.s some seri- ous \"bu~;,· as Miaosoft entrepreneur Bill Gates would it. Crime You\\'ve asked us for more police officers to patrOl the state highways and we\\'ve delivered. Governor Gary Johnson signed into law ler)slation ~ New Mexico\\'s State Poore funding to hire so more officers thi5 year and 40 more officers for each of the next three years. The $13 million package will also five our hard-working and tmderpaid peace officers a 20% pay raise. Education Reform Budget Woes The Democrat-controlled legislature stalled and defeated many popular and badly needed educational reforms, including Charter School expansion. We did manage to pass open enrollment legislation, making it easier for students to enroll in school outside their districts. But for the most part. we\\'ve cxmtinued to throw more and more money at a school system that fails to educate and prepare our children to compete in the growing global rnarl<et - a school sys- tem that remains unaccountable to the citizens of the state. Foro.mately, thi5 year\\'s spending increases will go where they belong ----~\"into the clas&ooms. Regular teachers will receive a 9% pay raise and $4 .5 million for teacher training programs. The $3.1Z billion ler)slative budget exceeds the state\\'s pro- jected re~ues and can run the state into debt. Governar Gary Johnson indicated that the new budget \"overspends and is unaccept- able.\" Fiscal responsibility towards the star.e\\'s checkbook is a ~ we owe to our children and grandchildren. Another \"bug\" in the budget is the shortfall in spending for the Department of Corrections and the Department of Public Safety. Cruciaf investigatory positions, such as a DNA expert\\'s job were unfunded and will expire if the budget =· unfettered. All indi- cations point toward Governor Johnson · the lawmakeis back to Santa Fe sometime before the end of the year, which is June 30, for a Special Ses.sion of the Legislature to untangle the budget mess and give it another shot The flawed budget arid unresolved drive-up liquor ban were not the only issues addressed thi5 year. Out of approximately 900 bills introduced, 144 were passed and sent to the Governor for him to sign or veto. There were some dramatic legislative highlights rey,ard- ing welfare reform, tax cuts, crime prevention. education reform. highway improvement and gaming oversight. Welfare Reform The ler)slature passed and Governor Johnson signed welfare reform into law. The long--0verdue, conunon-sense approach requires that everyone who can work will work. The plan calls for welfare recipients to work, either at a paying job or in community service, or to go to school in exchange for benefits. Welfare recipients and the ·working poor\" are also eligible for child care, job training and trans- portation. There is a five year limit of benefits in a lifetime. New Mexico is finally in line with the federal mandates for welfare reform. Tax Relief The overburdened taxpayers of New Mexico finally will benefit from some tax cutting measures. Led by the Governor himself, over $60 million a year in tax relief packages are now await- ing his signature. Among them are: 1. lifting the gross receipts tax on health care. 2. Lowering the unemployment compensation charges paid by businesses. 3. El.iminating the state tax on presatption drug sales. 4. Extending tax relief to the elderly, working poor and high Income New Mexicans. Highway lqlprovements The highways in N Mexico rate aroong the most danger- ous in the countzy. Compotinding the problem is the fact that our dilapidated roads are discouraging new and relocating businesses from settling here. Saving lives, encouraging economic development and servicing the state\\'s infrastructure are the motivating factors behind legislation allowing the Highway and Transportation Department to issue bonds for nearly $1.3 billion in road projects. A combination of federal and state funds will pay for road repair on the state\\'s most heavily traveled conidors In Albuquerque, Santa Fe and the Las Cruces area, as well as widening NM 44· to four lanes between Bloom.field and Bernalillo. Gaming Oversight Badly needed regulatory supervision of off-reservation slot machines was established in the form of the Gaming control Board with a $7 million appropriation signed by Governor Johnson. The board will ensure strict compliance with the state\\'s gaming ler)slation at fraternal organiz.ations and race tracks. The 1998 ler)slature\\'s accomplishments are important and praisewonhy. Unfortunately, the budget sent to Governor Johnson IS a mess. We\\'re not making any major travel plans between now and June 30th, because the general consensus is that we\\'ll ~ be called back to the drawing board in Santa Fe. Hopefully, during a special session, we can come up with a fair and responsible state budget ·············•******************** Kip Nicely State Representative/District 31 2%-9277 ••••••*******•••••••************** THE GRIT Regardless of race, creed, color, or when you were born ...

Bernalillo County has two initiatives for legi.51ative consideration that I would like to bring to your attention. EXTRATERRrrORIAL PL\\\\NNING, WNING AND ANNEXATION CUrrent law has conlliaing provisions providing cities and counties with authority for and jurisdiction over exoaterritorial platting and planning within the tmincorporared areas of counties. House Bill 238 provides: • A mechanism to establish an extraterritorial land use conunission composed of county and city members. • Open dialogue between the county and the city regarding forced annexations . SfATE OF NEW MEXJCO CONsrrnmONAL AMENDMENT The proposed amendment to the State Constirution would allow the voteIS of New Mexico to decide if Bernalillo County should establish a system for the professional seleaion of the County Clerk, County \\'Iteasurer, County Assessor and County Sheriff. By appointing offi- cials to these offices. county management would be able to eliminate redundant elfons and provide a higher level of service to the public. Please call us if you have any questions on these two issues. HAPPENINGS IN 1HE FAR NORTHF.ASr • At last!

Although there is always both upside and downside potential to the revenue situation, the effects of the federal budget reductions combined with an extremely low level of reserves puts New Mexico in a risky fiscal position that must be constantly moni- tored and analyzed. 1n hindsight, the Governor\\'s vetoes (over 200 bills) resulted in a \"savings\" to the State of over $50 million and helped the financial picture. With all 112 legislative seats up for election in 1996 (70 in the House, and 42 in the Senate), we expect a great deal of activity in the thirty-day Session (beginning January 16th) as the majority party spars with Governor Gary Johnson.

Sandia Prep• 532 Osum. NE Albuquerque, NM 87113 THE GRIT A QUARTERLY Pl)BLICATION OF Love Your Little (3/4 lb.) Feathered Neighbor My favorite neighbor is a native home- steader who is frequently misunderstood and under appreciated. Most people in the Southwest know that a favored food of the Greater Roadrunner is lizards. But do you know what else they eat? Twelve reasons why I appreciate my feathered neighbor is that some of its favorite foods are: 1. small snakes, including rattlesnakes, 2. scorpions, 3. taranculas, 4. spiders, 5. mice, 6. rats, 7. gophers, 8. grasshoppers, 9. centipedes, 10. millipedes, 11. crickets and 12 caterpillars. This native exterminator dwells, at no extra charge, in Sandia Heights and we should do everything we can to see that they continue to thrive here. However, humans are not known for being good neighbors to native animals and birds, but we have the power to change that Geococcyx calffomianus have lived in the Southwest for at least I 00,000 years as evi- denced by fossils found in the Rancho La Brea and McKittrick asphalt beds in California. Even back then, they preferred to exercise their exper- tise in being fleet of foot rather than flying for their primary mode of transporration. This makes good sense when you think about it Looking ac their favorite fare, you note that most of their food lives on the ground. Running on the ground not only brings them close to their prey, but by skill- fully using their wings as they run, they flush insects from their hiding places perched on planes and stems. These birds earned their common name of roadrunner back in the early days when they were most often seen running down the road in front of horses or horse-drawn vehicles. ~~ The narural habitat for roadrunners is · w t e see here. namely desen with sparse veg- \\\\e\\'tation.mte also live in thickets and even on the fffn~ . .s: of woods or forests.

       " 'The Albuquerque Public SChools Boundary Committee has submitted its recommendations for changes to existing school boundaries to Peter Horoschak, the APS Superintendent He will now review the Committee\\'s work and either forward their recommendation to the School Board, revise it or submit his own recommendation. The next event in this lengthy process will be a Public Hearing on October 30th. As at previous meetings, SHHA will present resri- mony on behalf of the residents of Sandia Heights. Since all recommendations thus far have kept Sandia Heights within the boundaries for La Cueva High ToUIQ.- ,,_ - Sandia Heights North High Desert School and had Middle SchOOt sru- den ts attending either the new Mid School or the current Eisenhower School, our role has been to support the recorrunenda- tions and to convey the fact that our area is vitally interested in the outcome of the process. Although the public hearing will have ocaured by the time you read this, several Board Members and hope- fully others will have attended to monitor and respond to the proceedings. 11le next important date is November 6th Sandia Heights Units Map Key -- Unit Division Lines UJ Unit Numbers ~11> Main Roads Neighborhood Streets Trails Tnillonr;c-~ Map.., lnlor.ariooi llMcnced, 1994\" 1996 Tram Tennnel Sandia Heights South ELECTION ISSUES INSIDE when the issue comes before the APS Board. My undel\\'Slallding is that the issue will be considered and a decision made at that meeting. Although the process has been favorable to Sandia Heights so far, it\\'s imponant no< to become complacent Now that the Boundary Coounittee has done its part. the rec- ommendations could be changed by either the Super intendent or the School Board. Please be alert to newspaper articles that differ with proposals described above. And join us at the School Board meeting November 6th. It\\'s very important that all decision makers realize Sandia Heights residents are vitally concerned about the education of our children. Continued on page 3 ... Learn Your Unit Number AND Your Covenants by Don Aunapu - SHHA Covenants, Chair A lot of SHHA attention is being directed to compliance with the covenants. Sandia Heights is divided into 30+ \"different\" units and the Association only has 6, non-paid conunittee members to cover them all. You can be assured that each of these volunteers tal<es their pa5i- tion very seriously ond ia making a =ened elfon to wsure that everyone in the community is in compliance with their particular unit\\'s covenants. As a result of covenant complaints from resi- dents as well as potential violations noted by committee members, there are 89 active cases as of the last report Each violarion is reviewed by a cornrninee member and a friendly letter sent ro the residents. Jn many cases, there is a simple lack of awareness of the covenants and once notified residents correct the violation. Jn some cases, however, there is a dispute and the process may lead ulti- mately to legal action, after careful consideration. Because the violations are numerous, please be aware that the process takes time. So don\\'t expea the siruation to be corrected as quickly as you, apd we, might like. 1b give yoo a Sense of the committee wo!ldoad and ro Jet you know you\\'re not alone if you\\'ve received a letter, here are some Slatistics by categ0ry of complaint • Unscreened air-<:anditioners, satellite dishes 53 • Weeds, debris, trash 8 • Campers, boats, trailers, RVs 12 •Trees, lan~ping 7 •Signs 7 • Unapproved construction 2 These numbers do not include complaints which have been amicably or otherwise resolved, and these com- plaints are in various stages of notification and resolu- tion. As you observe violations, please feel free to report them to the SHHA office at 296-1412. You should also be aware that covenants for every unit in Sandia Heights are not identical. Your neWbor just across the sireet may be in a different unit and\\' therefore their covenants may nor be the same as yours. For example, you may be restricted in your 1.Wparking of a Recreational Vehicle while your neigh- bor\\'s covenants may not even mention an RV. It only tal<es conrurrence of 75% of the residents in your unit ro change your covenants. And in some cases this may be the answer. Working toward a unified set of covenants for all of Sandia Heights can become a future goal of SHHA. Please let us know what you think of this idea If there is enough interest we may attempc this monu- mental task. Remember that maintaining the beauty of our area and increasing property values through covenant enforcement is everyone\\'s job as a resident - and part of being a good neighboc O>edc out your Unit Number on the Map and then ..

A QUARTERLY PUBLICATION OF R©UNDHOUSE REP©RT Brief Summaries of the Proposed Constitutional Amendments Appearing on the November 5th Ballot The.following is a condensed version Qf the legislative ccundl service publication entitled ·eonsdtutional Amendments Proposed by the Legislature in 1996 and Arguments For and Against. • Proposed Amendment 1 would change the state\\'s fonnula for spending the $7 billion in New Mexico\\'s !WO permanent funds and the money earned from investing chose funds. It would also change the way in which money in one of the funds could be invested. Supporters argue the changes are necessary to prO!eCt the long-term value of the funds against inflation. Opponents argue the propa>ed changes are financially risky. Proposed Amendment 2 would allow school disaicts to, in effea, borrow money by entering into \"lease-purchase\" agreements for education technology equipment without voter approval. Supporters aigue chat change is necessary because paying cash for computers and ocher technology is often irnpoo- sible. Opponents aigue chat voters should always be able to approve or disapprove questions of whether to borrow money. Proposed Amendment 3 would establish a procedwe by which eleaed roumy officials could be recalled from office. suppooers argue chat voters must have some method of removing eleaed ollicials from mis- feasance or malfeasance. Opponents argue chat eleaed officials can be removed at the next election, and even if they need to be removed earlier, the process set out in this proposal is too cumbersome. Proposed Amendment 4 would create a new way to amend the New Mexico Constirution - by allowing an independent c:ommisfilon to propose amendments chat could include broad changes to the ronstirution. Cwrently, only !he legislature can propooe amendments, and those propasals must be narrow. SlJWorters argue chat many parts of the state ronstirution need to be changed and an easier method of making chose changes must be developed. Opponents argue chat the prohibition against \"logrolling.· or forcing voters to approve or reject ~ constitutional amendments at once, should never be changed. Proposed Amendment 5 would raise the per diem and mileage allowances for legislators from $7 5 per day and $25 per mile, respectively, to standard lntanal Revenue Service rates for the city of Santa Fe, which is currently $124 per day and $28 per mile. Supporters argue the change is necessmy to fairly compensate New Mexico\\'s unpaid legislators for their lodging and travel expenses. Opponents argue chat voters should retain direct ronaol ova-~ ~diem and mileage alJowanc:es: Proposed Amendment 6 w0wct combine the appointal Public Un1ity cOmmission and the eleaed Slate Corporation Commission into a single, eleaed Public Regulation Commission. Supponers argue that the two cornmis.5ions share duties so similar they should be combined. Opponents argue chat the State Corporation Commis.5ion does far more than just regulate some un1ities; it reguiares the iINJrallCe; trucking and pipeline industries and should remain seimate from the Public Un1ity Commission. Proposed Amendment 7 would allow county governments to borrow money, subjea to a vote of the people, to purchase open space and buy the equipment necessary to build roads and bridges. SUpporters argue the amendment would give counties the flexibility needed to pwsue sound policies while preserving the voter\\'s right to approve borrowing. Opponents aigue chat')"

       " 'expenses this next year to cover: 1) playground maintenance, 2) covenant monitoring and resident information service, 3) snow removal, and 4) newsletters. The Tram Company has requested in writing to raise the playground maintenance fees to $1,800.00 per year. The Tram Company has also requested an increase in the fees for item (2) above from $3,000.00 to $3,600.00 a year. Since we expect to take over this work (see VI below), we do not know the exact expenses for \\'83-\\'84 in this category. Your Board cannot understand those who will not contribute the nominal $30.00 annual homeowners\\' membership fee. We will need additional funds in \\'83-\\'84 to work on your behalf, so please respond as soon as possible. VI. SEARCH FOR BOARD EXECUTIVEYICE PRESIDEN\\'I\\'(s)- SALARIBD POSITION(s) Your Board has decided to take over many functions now performed for homeowners by the Tram Company. These functions include: 1) covenant violation business, and 2) homeowners\\' information service. In addition, we believe there are daily information gathering. information dissemination, and lobbying efforts needed so that we, homeowner\\'s, can begin to fight for services from Bernalillo County and the state. For example, our Sandia Heights streets are suppose to be maintained by the county because these roads are owned by the county. However, as you know, we get absolutely nothing for our taxes in road maintenance service from the county. Lobbying efforts will also be needed to insure satisfactory development along Tramway, safety improvements on Tramway itself, and other property-value protecting activities. Much of this work needs to be done during day-working hours. Therefore, we are looking for one or two individuals who live in Sandia Heights and who have the time and interest to work in these capacities. Expenses and, possibly, a nominal salary will be paid. VIll. STATUS OF LOS ANGELF.S BLVD. As you may have noticed, Los Angeles Blvd. has received a much needed temporary paving job. This long awaited improvement should do much to alleviate the dust and will provide an alternate access road to and from Sandia Heights. IX. PARENTS: DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR KIDS ARE SHOOTING?

      "October 18, 1983 HOMEOWNERS' A~CIATION NEWSLETTER Dear Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association Member, Enclosed you will find important information regarding a number of subjects which will affect all of us in coming years. 1. COUNTY LINE RESTAURANT SURVEY RESULTS Thank you very much for responding to our questionnaire regarding your opinion on the County Line Restaurant and thei1· liquor license application. Your Homeowners' Board of Directors decided in a July 26, 1983 meeting to inform the entire Sandia Heights Community about the status of the County Line's new liquor license application, and, at the same time, conduct a written survey. Mr. Randall Williams, newly elected Board Vice-President, was asked to be in charge of the survey, including an additional random sampling poll. A questionnaire was mailed to 692 Sandia Heights residences on August 4, 1983, asking several questions concerning the County Line. As of August 22, 1983, 259 (37%) of the residents had responded. The results are as follows: Oppose -173 (67%), Support - 71 (27%), Don't Care - 15 (6%). Concurrently, 53 residents were randomlv selected from the total polulation (692) of homeowners to further ensure unbiased and complete results. These results, also obtained in writing, are as follows: Oppose - 35 (66%), Support - 16 (30%), Don't Care - 2 (4%). As can be seen, the residents of Sandia Heights, by more than a two-to-one margin, oppose this establishment. \\A,·e are confident in the accuracy cf this survey. There are additional points which should also be mentioned. First, the brochure sent out by the County Line while the survey was in progress did not alter the two-to-one against ratio in incoming returns. Secondly, the County Line brochure contained several misleading and incorrect statements regarding those who had worked hardest in opposing the restaurant and regarding interaction with the Homeowners' Board. If the Board had chosen to counter these misstatements by the County Line, we feel that the poll results could have been even more one-sided against the restaurant than they were. Thirdly. most of those who responded against, also indicated a commitment to activelv oppose the liquor license by turning out for any hearings. Only a handful of people stated that they would actively support the restaurant. Fourthly, the vast majority of individuals who oppose the restaurant do so because they are opposed to the additional traffic hazards that would result from heavier town traffic, particularly with liquor being a factor. II. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OPPOSES THE COUNTY LINE. After studying the questionnaire and random poll results, your Board of Directors, at a meeting held August 30, 1983, voted to follow the mandate of the majority of homeowners and actively participate in opposing the liquor license application of the County Line Restaurant & Bar in Sandja Heights. Also, on August 30, 1983, with very little advance notice, a preliminary approval hearing was held by the Alcholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board's Hearing Officer in Santa Fe. At that meeting, County Line presented their building layout proposal. The proposal now calls for an indoor lounge area of 70 seats, and an outdoor (patio) lounge area of 70 seats, in which alcoholic beverages but no food will be served. There is a 220 seat dining area indoors. This means that the County Line is essentially proposing a 140-seat lounge. We believe that this lounge capacity is not in keeping with the \"family restaurant\" image espoused by County Line. lll. HOMEOWNERS MEETING AND THE LIQUOR LICENSE COUNTY HEARING As of this writing ABC has not made a decision. We were originally led to believe that preliminar;.1 approval would be granted by the ABC because they traditionally look primarily at the financial responsibility of the establishment. However, the ABC Director, Mr. A. Rodriguez, informed me that neighborhood concerns are checked into by ABC. Rodriguez was interested in the results of our poll and promised that he would visit Sandia Heights personally before he makes a decision for ABC. If ABC grants approval, a letter is_ sent t9 the county and a county hearing date is set. Final liquor licen-se--approvaTrestsw1th-fhe colln(v.-\\\\le-wiB make every-attempt possible to get the county to hold its hearing during evening hours to enable maximum participation of residents. Notification of such hearings must run in the newspaper for two consecutive weeks. You should check daily in the legal notices section of your paper. We have just discovered that Mr. A. Rodriquez, has indeed granted preliminary approval, and that the county hearing has been set for: Wed. - November 2, 1983 - 2:00 P.M. Bernalillo County Office Building 620 Lomas, N. W. \\\\'e have decided to hold a Homeowners' Meeting specifically to mobilize efforts to fight the County Line Liquor License at the county hearing. Place: Sandia Heights Fire House Time: ,:30 P.M. Date: Tues., Nov. I, 1983 Subject: County Line Liquor License Opposition We originally intended to invite Mr. Bruce Walcutt from the County Line organization to - -- answe1~quesHons.--However;-sin-ce the County Line presente-dlheirc-ase quite full:.' in a5rochu-re - mailing, we have not invited them to the meeting. We will review the information we have. obtain commitments from those who can attend the hearings, and form car pools. We can expect the county hearing to occur within days after this meeting. IV. SPRING GENERAL MEETING ELECTION/JULY '83 BOARD MEETING MINUTES. As you know from the billing information sent to you in August '83 two new individuals were elected to the Homeowners' Board of Directors. Mr. Randall Williams and Ms. Kathleen LeBeck. In the July '83 Board Meeting, according to instructions in our by-laws, Board Officers were elected. These are: Wendland Beezhold, President; Randy Williams, Vice President; Mary Ann Reed, Secretary; and John Miller, Treasurer. Your Homeowners' Board of Directors reads as follows: Wendland Beezhold (President) 329 Paint Brush Drive Randy Williams (Vice President) 731 Tramway Lane 296-5761 to 6/85 296-5662 to 6/86 APPLICATIONS BEING RECEIVED FOR HOMEOWNERS' BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXECUTIVE VICE-PRESIDENT(s) SEND RESUMES TO: A. MILLER 223 SPRING CREEK LANE ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO 87122 VII. RESTRICTION VIOLATIONS Over the last several months the Homeowners' Association has been mailing as many as fifty letters per month on various restriction violations. Many of these letters concern the same violations, so that a general reminder to each household may be helpful and possibly,· curtail some future problems. As homeowners we may not: 1.) Store an unscreened boat, camper ·i:railer\", or recreational vehicle on our property, and this includes foldup camper-type trailers; storing any unscreened inoperable automobiles. utility type trailers, or commercial type vans or vehicles on our propert~· is prohibited. 2.) Add roof mounted air conditioning, solar collectors or additions to our homes without the specific approval of the Architectural Control Committee.* For information on submittals and approvals call 296-9585. 3.) Build a fence, wall, or other structure within l 5 feet of a property line unless specif- ically approved by the Architectural Control Committee. 4.) Install an unscreened antenna disc. Further, A.) Butane tanks are to be painted an earthtone to match the house and landscaped as an absolute minimum, and if necessary, adequately screened from the view of your neighbors. B.) White or silver roofs, whether flat or pitched, are not acceptable; any reroof work must be in earthtones as per the original approved plans. · C.) Swings, slides, basketball goals, etc .. are to be painted in earthtones. D.) Trash, junk, building materials, etc .. may not be stored in clear view on any lot or property. The Homeowners' Association in conjunction with the Architectural Control Committee intends to continue enforcing the restriction covenants for the benefit of the entire neighbor- hood. Each homeowner has the responsibility to meet these standards and is expected to do so.* In several cases, legal pursuit has been necessary and will continue to be an alternative if required. The rules are for everyone; our property values and quality of neighborhood are at stake. Your help and cooperation will be appreciated! * These restrictions are binding on all Sandia Heights Properties. If you have mislaid your copy of the \"Declaration of Restrictions\" and wish to refresh your memory, a copy may be obtained by calling 296-9585. Homeowners' Board of Directors continued .. Mary Ann Reed (Secretary) 514 Black Bear Loop John Miller (Treasurer) 548 Black Bear Road Kathleen LeBeck 1006 Tramway Lane Anita Miller 22 3 Spring Creek Lane Stan Bazant 575 Black Bear Road 294-4567 to 6/84 293-8144 to 6/85 298-3425 to 6/86 298-5023 to 6/84 296-2415 to 6/84 The Board also voted against requested increases in_ fees from the Tram Company to cover increases for playground maintenance, covenant' monitoring, and resident information service. These are functions performed by the Tram Company for the Homeowners' Association at agreed-upon fees. The Tram Company has since submitted justifications for the increases in writing. We expect negotiations will follow. V. TREASURER REPORT As of October 1, 1983, 188 homeowners had paid the 1983-84 membership dues of $30.00. The Homeowners' Association cash on hand is $6,834.92.

      "SANDIA RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIA':rION THANKS YOU - SANDIA HEIGHTS RESIDEN\"r.S! ! ~ife all deserve a hearty \"~\\fell done!\" for the support mustered in opposing the granting of a liquor license on Tramway Lane to County Line of Albuquerque. The location for this license and establishment was denied by l'ilr. Ti to Chavez, the County Hearing Officer, after a formal hearing on February 4, 198J, which 130 of us, braving a driving snow storm to get there, attended. we knew we had the facts and figures to support our contention that the establishment of this bar/restaurant on Tramway Lane would be detrimental to the safety and health of the nearby residents. Our attorney, lVir. NicCullough, did a superb job in organizing and presenting our case. Some of us homeowners may not realize that we are all voting members of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, although not voluntary dues-paying members. The Association represents all residents. A strong and active neighborhood association can have a tremendous positive impact on our environment. Therefore, please plan to attend on this Saturday, February 26, 1983 at 10: JO A.fo., the meeting of the Sandia Heights HomeoV'mers Association at the Firehouse; and, have something to say about your future in Sandia Heights. 21 February 1983 Sincerely, ~/t,J~ Randall v1/illiams, Chairman Sandia Residential Association\n",
