        "content": "<p>In the October 2024 issue of the GRIT, the SHHA President issued a call for new Board members, as well as a reminder that leaving food outside – whether in trash or containers – was a danger to bears, as they would likely have to be trapped and euthanized. The latter message was also mirrored in an article about Sandia Heights sightings of a mother bear and her three cubs. October’s monthly human-interest feature centered on resident Mary Cleo Fernandez. Author Claudia Mitchell chronicled Mary Cleo’s exceptional support for Casa Angelica, a home for individuals with profound developmental disabilities. In addition, there was a stirring memorial to Wade Jackson, by authors Katrina Sanchez and Viki Teahan. Wade was the selfless local attorney responsible for successfully challenging the City of Albuquerque for, and obtaining an injunction against, its planned construction of a large Education Center on the Elena Gallegos Open Space Preserve, which borders Sandia Heights. The October GRIT also featured Part II of the geology article by Stan Davis on why Sandia Heights has so many big rounded boulders on its trails and in its open spaces. Sprinkled throughout the issue are several short articles: a reminder to register to vote, a notice that SHHA Bylaws are being reviewed, a summary of the recent calls to Sandia Heights Security, the recently approved Architectural Control Committee applications, and the recently closed covenant support violations.<\/p>",

Committee member Judy Chreist's fidelity to SHHA was recognized. Kathleen McCaughey, Chair of the Environmental &amp; Safety Committee, voiced concerns over potential hazards of e bikes and micromobility devices. The SHHA is also preparing for the 21st Sandia Heights Artists Tour started by artist friends Lynda Burch and Ralph Rudolph. It became a prominent event with financial supporters and charity sponsorship, now features 43 artists yearly. A real estate transaction highlighted a strong market trend with a house at 2027 Quail Run CT NE being sold successfully. The historical significance of the nearby Jaral Pueblito was noted, with excavations revealing its long lasting presence and importance during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The thriving community has a \"Cork &amp; Fork\" Dining Activity, annual shredding event, approved community projects log, among other initiatives. A special feature story covers residents Kristin Ackerson and Dave Wilson who are very active in community life. Their son, David, has been enjoying scouting activities and is advancing to become an Eagle Scout. Despite the thriving local scene, the text didn't clarify the specifics of some topics related to homeowners in Sandia Heights. * Key Points: * Encouragement for resident participation in committees. * Concerns over traffic changes for e bikes and micromobility devices. * The renowned annual Sandia Heights Artists Tour featuring more than 40 artists and its history. * Strong real estate market trend in Sandia Heights. * Historical importance of Jaral Pueblito. * Thriving community activities in Sandia Heights. * The contribution of Scouting activities to the development of young residents. * Some topics related to homeowners not clarified.<\/p>",

The roles include Jim Stewart as President, Eric Faulring as Vice President, Martin Kirk as Secretary, Randy Tripp as Treasurer, Diane Barney as Office Director, and Trish Lovato as Lead Administrator, among others. The President's June 2024 message discusses ongoing issues and initiatives within the community as well as the history of the Cosme Garcia homestead in North Sandia Heights. Board discussions revolve around universal membership, engaging with the community newspaper The GRIT, and acknowledging long serving members. The homestead's history includes its use for grazing and cultivation, while the remnants of the homestead show indications of deterioration amidst an encroaching residential complex. A total of 148 neighborhood related calls was documented in June 2024, covering a wide range of matters, from alarms to pet nuisances. The GRIT also features profiles of local artists such as Deborah Griswold, who upcycles materials into beautiful artworks, and Ariel Foster, a talented musician turned teacher and watercolor artist. The community's sanitation service provider Sandia Heights Services offers assistance for disabled residents, and there are ongoing home improvement projects within the community. Lastly, recreational activities like the Duke City Bridge Club and the \"Cork & Fork\" Dining Activity are picking up again, with residents encouraged to join. Details about these updates, news, and initiatives can be found on both the SHHA website and The GRIT publication.",

Key activities include discussions on universal membership, younger board member inclusion, financial transparency, and incorporating neighbor feedback. SHHA features a president's message on ongoing activities in the association, their planned board meeting on April 10, 2024, the Sandia Heights security services distinction from SHHA, and guidelines for services, such as notary and copy services. The text also outlines geological features in the Sandia Heights region, including reddish Chinle rocks and brown coarse grained rocks, with an emphasis on Low Angle Normal Faults. It provides warnings against unsafely attracting bears through ill management of food waste and congratulates local artist Sharon Arendt for her acrylic work. The locals are encouraged to maintain the natural beauty of their homes while controlling invasive tumbleweeds and adhering to leash laws. Homeowners are also introduced to the new affiliate membership of the Sandia Heights Artists group and the bi monthly Cork & Fork dinners. For extra details, residents are encouraged to reach Rene Kessel or visit the SHHA's office.",

        "content": "The SHHA, which covers 2200 properties with 1800 members, successfully held its annual meeting with its board directors and office team. President Roger Hagengruber announced his departure while the association ensured financial stability even with increased dues and ticket costs. The team welcomed new members Diane Barney, Trish Lovato, and Holly Sylvester. These changes, along with various improvements, were documented in a video, now accessible on SHHA's website. The organization also completely implemented a Consent Agenda for optimized Board meetings. Detailed contributions from several committees include: The Architectural Control Committee managed over 300 projects, keeping a log on the SHHA website. The Communications and Publications unit continually upgrades the resident database interface and the SHHA website, which now includes the 2024 Residents Guide and Directory. The Community Service and Membership team focused on enhancing member benefits, increasing households to 1885 by year's end. The Covenant Support Committee guided residents to adhere to covenants through complaint forms and \"Good Neighbor\" letters, but faced challenges with Airbnb like violations and invasive elm trees. The Environment & Safety Committee emphasized wildfire risk reduction and encouraged community spirit through various activities. Lastly, the SHHA office sells safety vests at $3 per vest and Tram pass tickets, available on a first come, first served basis. Note that the Tram will undergo upgrades from January 9 to March 13, 2024.",

        "content": "The SHHA leadership committee, led by President Roger Hagengruber along with other officers and committee chairs, manages the office staff located at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Albuquerque. Some key updates from SHHA include mandatory membership for all homeowners effective 2025 in compliance with the Homeowners Act, introduction of damage assessments, bylaws revision, and website improvements. For the Annual Meeting on February 24, 2024, early submission of questions for the Q&A is encouraged. Key topics of discussion include fraudulent contractors, the importance of mindful outdoor lighting to preserve night sky views, and the specification that SHHA membership does not cover security services. Also outlined are standard office services such as notarizing, copying, and faxing, and the availability of tram passes. Community involvement is encouraged with several events planned by the Community Service and Membership Committee for 2024. Sandia Peak Utility Company has initiated the installation of new water meters and homeowners are expansively informed about their responsibility towards controlling leaks and necessary maintenance using the independent shutoff valve. Various neighborhood projects have been approved by the ACC Activity Log, and it encourages timely notice in case of plumbing emergencies. The residents are also urged to respect the outdoor lighting norms stipulated by the SHHA covenants to maintain the serene ambience in the area, the details of which can be found on the SHHA website. Resident Stan Davis enlightens the community about the history and misconceptions of the Juan Tabo Cabin ruins, urging active participation for submission of queries relating to SHHA for the Annual Meeting. Bimonthly dinner gatherings of the Sandia Heights \"Cork & Fork\", as well as the Sandia Heights book club updates, are shared, with the residents urged to register for text alerts from Sandia Heights services for timely updates.",

        "content": "The officers and board members of a certain organization include President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Hugh Prather, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp, with a board comprising individuals such as David Crossley, Elizabeth Edgren, and Arthur Romero, among others. Committee Chairs and Office Staff also form important parts of the organization's administration, with its office located at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Suite 3, Albuquerque, NM 87122. The organization is featured in The GRIT, a non profit media outlet in Sandia Heights, that discusses a range of topics including geological phenomena like the Great Unconformity in the Sandia Mountains, the artistry of Charlotte Driver in Neolithic pottery, and information about the services of the Sandia Heights Security. The Great Unconformity displays a significant geological time gap observable in the layered formations of the Sandia Mountains. Sandia Heights Artist, Charlotte Driver, uses unconventional materials to create color in her pottery and explores varied pottery techniques. SHHA members have various benefits such as email alerts, a comprehensive website, and access to the purchase of safety vests and tram passes through cash or check. This organization also emphasizes local artists like ink drawing artist Charlotte and glass artist Marianne Bettinger and their works available for sale. Projects under the ACC Activity Log demonstrate a range of construction and repair work undertaken in the area. Marianne Bettinger creates unique glass designs in her garage workshop, powered by solar panels. SHHA promotes community unity and environmental cleanliness through events and initiatives. Sandia Heights and Primrose Pointe service areas are undergoing a water meter replacement project, funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and aiming to improve water conservation and reduce water loss.",

They also expressed concern for unrestrained dogs in the community and stress Bernalillo County Code regulations for pet safety. Reported successful initiatives include the 20th annual Artists Studio Tour and provision of customized tutoring services by Tutor Doctor. Sandia Heights Services is a subscription service separate from SHHA, offering utilities and security services for residents. Information for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta 2023, member benefits of SHHA, and the 6.5 mile loop trail were also supplied. Other updates include the GRIT periodical passing its editorship to Kevin Lloyd, running an annual photo contest, and new community events like the \"Cork & Fork\" dining activity. Finally, SHHA encouraged residents to observe the October 14 annular solar eclipse safely and sent ahead a Happy Halloween wish.",

        "content": "The SHHA committee, chaired by Phil Krehbiel, Arthur Romero, Susan McCasland, Elizabeth Edgren, Kathleen McCaughey, Randy Tripp, and Hugh Prather, say goodbye to Angela Moreno from office staff. Angela is moving on to Sandia National Laboratories and is also known for her side career as a baker. SHHA emphasizes bear sightings and the importance of homeowners securing their garbage and adhering to their covenants to avoid penalties. The association encourages homeowners to use contractor evaluation binders, which include feedback and ratings on service providers from multiple fields. They also must submit committee approved ACC applications for external projects. The upcoming Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour will feature artists Collin Delker and Mara Malnekoff. Collin uses his electrical engineering background to create unique fractal artwork, showcased for the first time at the 2021 Sandia Heights Artists Tour. Mara creates wearable art through clothing. GRIT documents the community's various approved projects, including driveway replacements and HVAC installations. More details about these projects can be found on the Sandia Homeowners website. SHHA offers member benefits, such as discounts at several participating merchants. The text details the geological history of the Sandia mountains and how calcium carbonate layers formed over time, creating limestone cliffs. It warns against poisoned rodent traps, which could harm the broader ecosystem. Instead, homeowners should maintain cleanliness and use safe trapping methods. It also calls for residents to verify their listings in the Resident Guide and Directory by November 3rd, 2023. The text also discusses Bernalillo County Codes and Ordinances and urges homeowners to refer to these when necessary. The SHHA has resumed its “Cork & Fork” dining activity and is preparing for the 20th Annual Sandia Heights Studio Art Tour. It also announces an annual photography contest where the entry work must be an original piece from the entrant. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association office will be closed on September 4th in observance of Labor Day.",

The Covenant Support Committee recently enforced rules against room rentals in Sandia Heights, while the Environment & Safety Committee underlined the need for fire resistant roofing material such as concrete or clay tiles, PVC roofing, and others. A local initiative has seen residents create mini libraries for book exchanges, and the local artist Eric Guenette has been showcased for his work with discarded materials. A May 2023 report showed incidences ranging from theft to suspicious behavior, while updated office hours, emergency contacts, and member services were listed. The local artisan Mary Ellen Merrigan was profiled for her creative jewelry work, safety information for pets was shared, and a log of ACC approved upgrades and maintenance was shared, including roofing, landscaping and driveway extensions. Wildlife features highlighted local rodents' importance in the ecosystem and suggested ways to humanely manage pests. Geological features of the area, including the Sandia Granite dikes, were also detailed. Community events included a photo contest, Neighborhood Afternoon Out, Cork & Fork dining activity and the Sandia Heights Art Tour.",

        "content": "The SHHA, led by President Roger Hagengruber, is grappling with a decline in volunteer participation threatening its functioning. Consisting of seven committees, each member is expected to serve on one. However, limited volunteer numbers risk the continuation of these crucial groups safeguarding community interests. The association monitors city developments, including the ongoing \"Save the Elena Gallegos\" lawsuit against the city of Albuquerque. In this action, volunteers are seeking a permanent injunction to preserve the area as open space. The warmer season results in weed overgrowth, prompting numerous complaints to the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) and emphasizing the need for vigilant lawn maintenance for the overall neighborhood aesthetic. In 2004, a local artists' tour was organized by SHHA residents Lynda Burch and Ralph Rudolph. Despite the lockdown, the artists presented their work virtually, and today prepares for the 20th tour featuring 50 artists across 15 locations. Detailing the journey of various artists, including gourd artist Marta Burckley and collage creator Lynda Burch, the SHHA Member Benefits Program offers discounts for members at several participating merchants. SHHA members can find more information about these discounts on www.sandiahomeowners.org. Prominent geological features in Sandia Heights include \"white\" dikes in Sandia Granite of magmatic formation, providing scenic views of nature's structural formations. The community assures various activities and events, including an annual photo contest, \"Cork & Fork\" dining, with new resident artists introduction within the thriving artist community. The article also mentions the 1972 relocation experience of the author's family to the base of the Sandia Tram and announces the Summer Solstice event on June 21, 2023.",

After 15 years of service, Lead Administrator Betsy Rodriguez has resigned, and the association is seeking a replacement. The SHHA has several initiatives underway: Highlighting fire safety: Susan McCasland warns of early onset of brush fires around the foothills. Challenging development in Elena Gallegos Open Space: The \"Save the Elena Gallegos\" (STEG) nonprofit is petitioning against city plans for development, with support actions that include committing to yard signs, signing and sharing a petition, and joining the STEG Google Group. Advocating for community standards and security: The Covenant Support Committee cautions against short term room rentals and issues guidance on cleanliness, trash disposal, and car parking. Fostering neighborhood wildlife: The text includes an update on the Raptor Nesting Project and requests for residents to adopt natural pest control methods. Overseeing architectural changes: The Architectural Control Committee is coordinating upgrades on various residences within Sandia Heights. Offering members benefits: Members have access to project details, a color reference guide for projects, and discounts from participating merchants, as well as an annual photography competition. Encouraging mail security measures: It recommends installation of locking mailboxes and use of post office boxes as anti theft precautions. Showcasing unique geological features: Highlighting the Pennsylvanian age Sandia Formation, informing hikes along the South Crest Trail. Generating community engagement: Hosting events like 'Cork & Fork' dinners and the Sandia Heights Art Tour. The SHHA emphasizes the enhancement of neighborhood harmony, fire safety, natural environmental care, community standards, local wildlife, architectural projects, mail safety, and engaging community events, offering discounts for members and celebrating local geography. The SHHA office is located at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Ste. 3 in Albuquerque, open on weekdays, and provides emergency contact numbers for services including the County Sheriff and Fire Department, Water\/Sewer emergencies, and power outages. All of these efforts work towards maintaining a safe, clean, and harmonious community in Sandia Heights.",

Key future events offered by SHHA are the Annual Meeting on February 25, 2023, and a Wildfire Risk Reduction Workshop on March 25, 2023. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC), guided by Bob Thomas, is tasked with ensuring covenant rules are upheld, with particular complaint procedures including step by step assessments and potential legal action. Interestingly, the Sandia Mountains' Madera Limestone harbors a significant amount of now orange colored crinoid fossils due to hydrothermal fluids caused by rifting activity, as explained by Virgil Lueth, a professor at New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. A range of services and guidelines are provided to Sandia Heights residents through community notices, including emergency contacts, household maintenance tips, future office closures, resident voting registration, and sale of safety items amongst others. The article also details SHHA's ongoing residential neighborhood projects and member benefits, all of which can be found in greater detail on their website. Additionally, the SHHA supports community groups, such as the Cork & Fork dinners, where residents enjoy meals together, and invites other similar groups to promote their events through the Community Events Bulletin Board. Finally, SHHA's office will be closed on Presidents' Day, February 20, 2023.",

        "content": "The SHHA has announced its officers, board members and committee chairs for 2023, made up of President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Hugh Prather, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp, among others. Office staff is made up of Betsy Rodriguez and Anna Diaz. Rick Thomson clarified that membership fees go towards maintaining the environment, legal costs and initiatives to improve property value among other benefits. The Airbnb type room rentals are prohibited due to potential security issues. A geological feature, magnetite, is found in quantity on the western side of the Sandia Mountains. Information on local Sparrow species was given along with the Sandia Heights Security's November 2022 showing types of calls received. The SHHA membership is separate from Sandia Heights Security, and a variety of support information and local events was listed. Residents were also given tips on home maintenance in winter and upcoming spring and it was reported that Albuquerque was being recognized for its parks, hiking, and biking trails. Updates were given on the Elena Gallegos development and trail projects, and including a wheelchair accessible trail. A program, the Youth Conservation Corps (YCC), is providing young people with outdoor conservation jobs and is working with APS Work Study program for trail maintenance. Trail use advice was given to reduce damage. The GRIT magazine further provided updates on trail works and ongoing conservation efforts. Certain unmaintainable trails are being closed and rerouted with the aim to restore these areas to their natural state. To aid this, users are urged to use a Trail Guide. Vicki Penneman won this year's photo contest and her photo will cover the 2023 SHHA Resident Guide and Directory. The association's office will be closed on Monday, January 16, 2023, to observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA), established nearly five decades ago, oversees covenants established by the Sandia Heights Sandia Peak Tram Company to preserve the quality of life and natural environment of the area. This non profit manages its duties through volunteers and applies 38 distinct covenants to various spaces within its jurisdiction. Key points include: An urgent call is in place for volunteers to serve on the SHHA board and committees, especially in the wake of potential legal infringements by the City of Albuquerque over the Elena Gallegos Open Space (EGOS). The November 2022's Grit document outlines several community updates, such as calls for volunteers, reported power outages, the announcement of a board meeting, and free services available to members. The New Mexico's piñon pine, a critical part of the local ecosystem and culture, is increasingly threatened due to climate change. Homeowners are advised on how to weatherproof their pipes ahead of the fast approaching winter season. A fascinating article on the historic KiMo Theater illuminates its architectural beauty, the presence of Swastika symbols, and stories of a ghostly presence in the form of a boy named Bobby and a bonnet clad woman. Finally, SHHA welcomes amateur photographers to take part in the annual photo contest, with community events and upcoming SHHA office closures also announced.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA), comprising of officers President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Dale Arendt, Secretary Martin Kirk, Treasurer Randy Tripp, and others, is managed by dedicated board members and committee chairs, each responsible for a specific area such as Architectural Control, Covenant Support, Communications & Publications, etc. The administration office is located at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Ste.3, Albuquerque, NM, handled by Betsy Rodriquez and Anna Diaz. Noteworthy points from the October 2022 volume include: The ending of several directors' terms in February 2023 necessitates the search for new ones. Candidates must be SHHA members and property owners in Sandia Heights, committed to serving and upholding the bylaws. The residents were informed about the potential health risks of radon gas increased by low atmospheric pressure, closed doors and windows, and its higher levels in spring than in summer. Suggestions included installing active and passive radon mitigation systems and continuously monitoring with radon detectors. Historical data indicated the efficacy of radon mitigation systems in lowering overall radon levels. Color trends and house beautification tips included favoring vibrant shades, using the ACC Color Reference Guide, and taking advantage of the home renovation projects reported on the SHHA website. The SHHA member discounts, architectural color traditions of New Mexico, and the necessity of ACC approval for external changes were discussed. Other topics included the Roadrunner Curling Club's offerings, the Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory's October 28, 2022, deadline for changes, a resident photo contest, the bi monthly \"Cork & Fork\" dining event, and the office closure on October 10, 2022, for Indigenous Peoples Day.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association (SHHA) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, overseen by officers, board members, office staff, and community committee members, is currently looking for new Board of Directors members as several terms are due to expire. This board represents the community's interests with minimum 11 members for operation, but eligibility includes being a Sandia Heights property owner with paid SHHA membership dues and capable of upholding Bylaws. Additionally, SHHA offers community services, assistance in connecting members with shared interests, and resources like notary services, information alerts, and access to various free services including voter registration and meeting dates. Safety vests and tram passes are also available for purchase to members. SHHA residents are also tackling the increasing tumbleweed problem, an invasive species harmful to garden crops and posing wildfire risks, and are encouraged to handle their removal through mechanical means before they mature and spread seeds. Also, the local government, Bernalillo County, advises residents to maintain weed growth on their properties and refrains from chemical usage. SHHA offers benefits including hummingbird attractions, access to approved project data including construction and landscaping, discounts from various merchants, and guidance on \"xeriscaping,\" a water efficient landscaping practice. The association's website, www.sandiahomeowners.org, offers a variety of benefits to SHHA members. The community also welcomes residents to the 19th Annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour due on September 17 18 and urges them to participate in a neighbourhood cleanup event, and the annual photo contest for the 2023 Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory, ending November 4. Lastly, residents are reminded not to feed wild animals, to maintain neighborhood aesthetics and safety, and to review subdivision covenants to safeguard against potential issues.",

        "content": "The SHHA (Sandia Heights Homeowners Association) board is comprised of President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Dale Arendt, Secretary Martin Kirk, Treasurer Randy Tripp, and several other board members. Committee chairs include David Crossley, Bob Thomas, Susan McCasland, Elizabeth Edgren, Randy Tripp, Dale Arendt, and Joe Boyce, with Betsy Rodriguez and Anna Diaz as office staff. The SHHA office is located at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Ste. 3, Albuquerque, open M F from 9AM 4PM. Beginning August, notary services will function solely by appointment on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The 19th Annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour, designed to support La Mesa Academy, will feature a preview night and variety of art forms available for purchase. Annual Water Quality Reports from Sandia Heights Services offers information regarding local water quality. Also, issues related to reflective blue markers on fire hydrants should be reported to BernCo. Eric Haskins' essay underlines the importance of light and its usage, touching on the New Mexico Night Sky Protection Act and minimising light pollution. There's also advice on outdoor lighting, which discourages motion detector security lights that can blind people and encourages consistency in color temperature. Emphasis is also placed on controlling tumbleweed growth. Finally, key information is shared regarding a board meeting scheduled for August 10, the SHHA Member Benefits Program, the North Domingo Baca Multigenerational Center, and the 171 calls received by Sandia Heights Security Patrol. Other events lined up for September by the Sandia Heights Artists and the reopening of the \"Cork & Fork\" dining activities are also worth noting, as well as reminders to careful driving as school resumes on August 10.",

The SHHA office, open weekdays between 9 AM and 4 PM, is led by Betsy Rodriguez and Anna Diaz. It offers several free services and products for members, as well as an ACC Color Reference Guide and a program offering discounts at local businesses. Residents have been advised to take precautions for the fire season, dog barking violations, and high summer temperatures that can hurt dogs. Bullet points in this context include: Precautions for an unprecedented fire season Compliance with Bernalillo County Code of Ordinance 6 47 regarding dog barking. Protection for dogs against burns from hot asphalt during high summer temperatures. A variety of snake species including non venomous bull snakes and venomous rattlesnakes are found in Sandia Heights. While the former are harmless, residents are advised to contact Bernalillo County Animal Control upon encountering the latter near their homes. The monthly report also includes various approved property projects and tips for keeping houses cool during the hot season as well as highlighting New Mexico's wine production history. SHHA members also expressed opposition to the proposed Elena Gallegos expansion citing potential increasing crime, fire risk, noise and damage to the natural setting. Instead, they advocate for improvements to existing nature trails and habitats. Lastly, the annual Artists Tour will occur on September 17 and 18, 2022 featuring various artists like Denise Sanchez, Sharon Arendt, Jonna James, Eric Guenette, and Kathleen McCaughey. The SHHA office will remain closed on July 4th for Independence Day.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) has announced its leadership lineup with Roger Hagengruber as president, Dale Arendt as vice president, Martin Kirk as secretary and Randy Tripp as treasurer alongside committee chairs and office staff, led by administrator Betsy Rodriguez with Anna Diaz. They operate from 9 AM to 4 PM on weekdays at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Ste. 3, Albuquerque, NM 87122. SHHA is hosting a Membership Appreciation Event on Sunday, June 5th at the Sandia Heights Village. The SHHA Environment & Safety Committee recently discussed the Elena Gallegos Open Space's development plans. Long term RV parking prohibited by the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) at Sandia Heights due to a negative impact on community aesthetics and property values. The Committee reminds homeowners of the separate security subscription from SHHA membership while urging residents to keep RV parking to 48 hours before or after a trip. Important notifications include SHHA Office timings, listings for local services, and a board meeting via Zoom on June 8, 2022. SHHA members can avail discounts from participating merchants, borrow the ACC color reference guide, and access notary services, copies, faxes, voter registration, safety vests and tram passes at the office. Eric Haskins shared insights about the Sandia Heights neighborhood in the \"Architectural Observations #1. A Love Letter to Sandia Heights\" article, discussing maintaining and upgrading homes while preserving the shared environment. Dr. Thompson recommended plant identification apps in February 2022, as well as book resources on New Mexico's native plant species, and provided home recipes for eco friendly weed killers and insecticides. Precautions for using homemade bug sprays, wildfire hazard awareness, Letters to the Editor, responses to articles, and corrections to printed versions were addressed in GRIT's June 2022 edition. The Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity was reintroduced, and the Sandia Heights Art Tour was scheduled for September 17 18. The SHHA Office will observe Juneteenth by closing on June 20th.",

        "content": "The text provides a detailed overview of an organization, including its leadership structure, office staff, ongoing community initiatives, and various points of community focus. Executive leaders include President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Dale Arendt, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp, along with board members comprising Joseph Boyce, David Crossley, Elizabeth Edgren, and others. Office administrators are Betsy Rodriguez and Anna Diaz, with the office based in Albuquerque, NM. Community efforts include fire risk mitigation in Sandia Heights, involving clean up of flammable items, evacuation plans, and registration for Bernalillo County's emergency notification system. There's also engagement with construction proposals at Elena Gallegos Open Space and Simms Park Road, with aims to enhance outdoor furnishings, ADA facility access, and possibly establish a small education center. The center could house classrooms, interpretive areas, and offices, operating under eco friendly principles and offering education and engagement opportunities. Recent security statistics and emergency contact information are available, along with various member benefits including shared resources, discounted rates, and local merchant deals. Community behavior and involvement focus on actions like the proper disposal of pet waste during hikes and showing support for international conflicts. The importance of septic system care and the regulations regarding replacements are highlighted, with emphasis on the challenges posed by property landscapes and individual project requirements. Seasonal RV parking restrictions are in place, and community centric events like the retirement of a long serving postal worker, Membership Appreciation Day, and the Sandia Heights Art Tour are also mentioned. The organization's office will be closed for Memorial Day, with overall goals aimed at fostering community engagement and creativity while observing key dates.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) consists of officers, board members, office staff, and committee chairs. Highlights include: Officers include President, Roger Hagengruber; Vice President, Susan McCasland; Secretary, Martin Kirk; and Treasurer, Randy Tripp. The office staff is led by Administrator, Betsy Rodriguez and her assistant, Teresa Gonzales. The annual meeting to be held on February 19th will cover topics such as street side cleanup requirements. Rick Thomson, a nominee for the board will also be introduced. The SHHA is considering hiring a commercial landscaper for major street side cleanup, but concerns regarding cost, liability, and communication have stalled the proposal. In November, Sandia Heights Security responded to 126 calls for varying incidents. SHHA provides numerous administrative services for members, including notary services and email alerts. An initiative to maintain environmental stewardship is in place targeting invasive Siberian Elms. Young trees are encouraged to be removed, while mature ones due to cost implications are not mandated for removal. A recent eco friendly initiative, the Little Green Bucket service, helps residents compost their garbage and food scraps. SHHA members can gain valuable information through the association's official website, including board meeting schedules, classified ad rules, and tram pass details. The association has initiated a program to list Little Libraries, suggesting residents to chip in with any information they have. New Year's celebrations history and traditions from around the world are described, dating back to ancient civilizations aligning it with agricultural and astronomical events. The SHHA office will be closed on January 17, 2022, in celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.",

        "content": "The SHHA has numerous key staff members including President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp. The SHHA Office is located in Albuquerque and managed by Betsy Rodriguez and Teresa Gonzales. Due to an influx in operating costs, SHHA dues will increase from $8.50 to $9.00 monthly. A total of 8 tram passes daily will be provided at a cost of $7.50 each. The Annual Meeting for 2022 will be held online on February 19, 2022. Nominating Committee Chair, Susan McCasland, introduces Kathleen McCaughey as a SHHA Board of Directors candidate. It's forbidden to store trash bins visibly, violating the neighborhood covenant. SHHA Key Tags provide special discounts to local residents with participating merchants. Contact the Office for more information or to request one. Notifications of attendance to board and committee meetings should be made at least 24 hours in advance. It's deemed harmful and illegal to feed deer in New Mexico due to potential health risks. Feeding deer with unnatural foods may cause dangerous digestion issues which can be fatal. There have been instances of deer being infected with coronavirus, although transmission from deer to humans remains unproven. However, veterinarians suggest taking precautions when hunting and ensure the venison is properly cooked before consuming. Contact the SHHA Office to purchase safety vests and tram passes. SHHA memberships are separate from security memberships, with the latter provided by Sandia Heights Services. An ACC Color Reference Guide can be borrowed from the Office for up to a month with a $20 refundable deposit. SHHA members can avail discounts from participating merchants. Various holidays celebrated in December are outlined, such as Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year's Eve, and a number of others. Japanese New Year traditions include consuming long noodles and visiting temples or shrines at midnight. The ACC has approved tasks like door replacement, installing roof mounted photovoltaic panels, garage additions, and stucco repair. Albuquerque is popular for its unique Christmas lights. The \"Cork & Fork\" dining activity, held at member homes, will resume with bimonthly dinners. The SHHA office will be closed from December 24, 2021 to January 3, 2022 for the holidays.",

The SHHA is currently inviting applications for the Board of Directors, with successful candidates due to begin serving right after the Annual Meeting in February. Interested parties can access these applications via the SHHA website. The SHHA is eager to acquire community feedback regarding invasive tree species in Sandia Heights, particularly the Siberian Elm. Property owners are recommended to consider applying herbicides, like Garlon 4 or Triclopyr4, to contain the issue. SHHA's Architectural Control Committee's (ACC) Formal Design Guidelines are now enforceable, and the details can be found on the SHHA website. Changes to the 2022 directory entries are accepted, and new residents need to verify their contact details with the SHHA offices. The SHHA also highlighted community events such as the Cork & Fork dining activity and an upcoming photo competition. The association is not affiliated with Sandia Heights Security, and contact details can be found in the monthly report. Notable landmarks in the community include The Church of the Good Shepherd, which has been serving since 1985, and the local high school, La Cueva, named in honor of the 10th Duke of Alburquerque, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva. Lastly, SHHA will host a semi annual trash pickup on November 6, and the office will remain closed on November 11 for Veterans' Day and November 25 & 26 for Thanksgiving.",

        "content": "The SHHA, headed by President Roger Hagengruber, operates on San Rafael Avenue, Albuquerque, NM from 9 AM to 4 PM. Upcoming events include the Albuquerque School Board election featuring candidates Nicholas Bevins, Julie Brenning, and Courtney Jackson, and Zoom webinars organized by the Community Service & Membership Committee. Historical contexts from the area include the life histories of Domingo Baca and Josefa Baca, notable individuals with significant influences in New Mexico. However, Sandia Heights faces recurring violations against community guidelines, prompting the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to allocate legal status and penalties for violations. Additionally, the SHHA has established protocols for proposing amendments to unit covenants and provides emergency, utility, and other contact information. SHHA also provides office hours updates, board meeting schedules, various member benefits, and notices. It calls attention to the ecological balance, cautioning against invasive plant species that can disrupt the local environment and reminding homeowners to manage plant growth. Several invasive species have been identified in the area, including Scotch thistles and tumbleweeds, which homeowners are encouraged to control. Likewise, community enhancement activities like construction projects require ACC's approval. Residents have the opportunity to join community dinner programs and the annual photo contest for the 2022 Resident Guide & Directory. The SHHA also encourages homeowners to review their directory entries and send in updates for the 2022 edition. Home weather management tips include manipulating window shades relative to the sun's position. The SHHA office will observe Indigenous Peoples' Day on October 11, 2021, and therefore will not open.",

With an office at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Ste. 3 in Albuquerque open Monday Friday, the SHHA Board oversees several committees including architectural control, covenant support, communications, and finance. A rise in requests for solar panel system installations noted by Bob Bower from the ACC encourages homeowners to factor in sun orientation and roof condition for efficient installation. The community in Unit 23 promotes communication and resident engagement through a Google Group, Neighborhood Watch program, Little Free Library, annual Memorial Day block party and a welcome procedure initiated by resident Roseann Houlihan 20 years ago The importance of community safety highlighted in recent Sandia Heights Security Patrol log and offerings of the SHHA Member Benefits Program, e.g., safety vests and tram passes, plus access to various service discounts. Further, there are restrictions on parking recreational vehicles such as boats and RVs to maintain aesthetics and property values. Notable community projects involve roof installations and restorations, with members like Ms. George showing exemplary community spirit by dedicating time to clear invasive tumbleweeds. The community calendar marks the Sandia Heights Art Tour for the weekend of September 25 26, but \"Cork & Fork\" Dining Activities continue to be on hold due to the pandemic. The deadline for the Sandia Heights 2022 Resident Guide & Directory's annual photo contest is November 5, 2021. The SHHA office will be closed on July 5th for Independence Day.",

Notary services, email alerts, contractor evaluation binder, tram passes, and safety vests are on offer for SHHA members, with discounts from participating merchants.

A brief guide was provided on how to join their Zoom meetings with information about the control options within the platform. Details of maintenance activities underwent and planned were given.

        "content": "The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) has various officials including President Woody Farber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Travis Rich, Treasurer Cheryl Iverson, board members Dale Arendt, Bob Bower, and Joe Boyce, and Committee Chairs such as Bob Bower for the Architectural Control Committee (ACC). Others include Bob Thomas for the Covenant Support Committee (CSC), Susan McCasland for Communications and Publications (C&P), Stephen Baca for Community Service and Membership (CS&M), Cheryl Iverson for the Finance Committee (FC), and Travis Rich for the Parks and Safety Committee (P&S). The organization seeks new Board members with an emphasis on pre retirees and families with children. Community services involve residents maintaining an adopted section of Tramway Blvd and dealing with the issue of Siberian Elm trees increasing water usage and septic system costs. SHHA suggests collective action against mature invasive trees and offers facilitation of resolutions. Board member, Joe Boyce, proposes individual security camera installation being the most beneficial for community safety, suggesting private systems for residents near neighborhood entry points. They hope to discourage crime through signage and provide system recommendations. Latest statistics reveal in September 2020, 20 alarm calls and 65 special requests were made but it's important to note that Sandia Heights Services do not include subscriptions to SHHA or Sandia Heights Security membership. Residents need to confirm this. Carco Air Service's Chief Pilot, Jim Bixler, discovered a plane wreckage on the “Dragon's Tooth” pinnacle, with the recovery operation transitioning to the recovery of 16 bodies. A Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation in March 1955 concluded that alongside poor weather, the aircraft was approximately 10 miles off course. In terms of property, several projects were approved by the ACC including maintenance, repair, and installation works. Information on these can be found on their website. There's a cancellation notice of the Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity due to the pandemic. Also, Albuquerque's main water sources are mentioned, and there's information concerning bow hunting regulations. A free gardening webinar series, “Ready, Set, GROW!” is offered, covering home, vegetable, and landscape gardening topics and is delivered twice a month until March 2021 by various experts. A series of date specific plant care and gardening events are open to those interested. Lastly, closings of the SHHA office at 12700 San Rafael Ave. NE Ste. 3, Albuquerque, NM, are announced for Veterans Day and Thanksgiving.",

The office, located at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Albuquerque, and operated by Lead Administrator Betsy Rodriguez and Administrator Jennifer Craft, is open from Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 4 PM. The association released voting information for October 2020, informing residents about registration, absentee ballot procedures, and early voting options. Additionally, homeowners were updated on septic system maintenance and advised of a potential removal of cottonwood trees in Little Cloud Park. SHHA also commemorated the TWA 260 flight crash of 1955. Sandia Heights Security reportedly received 121 calls in August, with incidents ranging from minor disturbances to vandalism. The SHHA also shared details about Vinegaroons or whipscorpions. These arthropods, which are harmless to humans, are important for maintaining balance in the insect population. For garden enthusiasts, the association shared tips for planting Russian Sage, a durable and drought tolerant plant great for landscapes. However, SHHA warned residents about the temporary cancellation of its \"Cork & Fork\" dining event due to the pandemic. Lastly, SHHA called for participants for their annual photo contest, inviting entries related to the Sandia Heights area. It remains committed to serving the Albuquerque community, the most populous city in New Mexico.",

There are hunting allowances in the Cibola National Forest, rules addressing light pollution in Sandia Heights and specific details regarding a recent covenant violation filed by a homeowner. Sandia Heights Security provides support and contact information for county ordinance violations. The document provides information about utility faults and emergencies, member benefits, and the importance of community involvement in property upkeep. The community, also host to Albert G.

Details about Albuquerque's history, community events, corrections to the GRIT printed version, and the annual photo contest for resident amateur photographers are highlighted. The SHHA office will be closed on Labor Day, and a community meet will be held on September 26, with pandemic precautions in place.",

        "content": "The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA), based in Albuquerque, is overseen by president Woody Farber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Travis Rich, and Treasurer Cheryl Iverson, among a board of 15 members. The Association has highlighted developments regarding COVID 19 impacts on their operations, with neighborhood reviews being done differently but administrative abilities intact. The necessity of self care is strongly emphasized in an offered essay by Ruth Baird Pollard on confronting dementia. The Association has issued guidelines on peaceful coexistence with local wildlife due to increased reports of bear sightings and snakes. Furthermore, tips on dealing with snake encounters are outlined. Amid the pandemic, the SHHA office now reopened functions with new measures. The SHHA notes that approved home improvement projects continue and SHHA services, including emergency numbers for utility services, are provided to all members. Important community events such as the annual photo contest and the anticipated Grit Journal contributions are being managed, while the Sandia Peak Tram operations have been adapted for safety and health concerns. However, several activities including the Art Tour by Sandia Heights Artists and Sandia Heights \"Cork & Fork\" dining activities have been postponed or cancelled due to COVID 19. SHHA encourages new members and offers corrections from the written versions of the GRIT on their official website.",

        "content": "The text primarily discusses the operational details of an unnamed organization led by President Woody Farber and Vice President Susan McCasland, with its office located on San Rafael Avenue in Albuquerque. The organization has numerous committees responsible for various areas, such as architectural control, community service, and finance. The text also touches upon the importance of (1) COVID 19 safety measures, (2) preparedness for the fire season, and (3) strategies to prevent home thefts and vandalism. In terms of construction and parking management, residents are advised to have clear discussions with contractors and neighbors, and maintain courteous and safe conditions. The text also offers guidance around parking laws, prohibiting abandonment of vehicles and highlighting the consequences of impeding emergency vehicles. The local publication, The GRIT, welcomes contributions from the community members and provides regular security updates from the Sandia Heights Security. The text also addresses concerns over the private usage of arroyos or naturally formed water channels. It underscores the importance of respecting private properties and exploring designated public areas for hiking. The latest activities within the Sandia Heights community are also addressed, including project updates, changes in community events due to the COVID 19 pandemic, and information about the Plant of the Season, the Algerita.",

        "content": "In response to Coronavirus updates in mid May, Governor Lujan Grisham has permitted some easing of restrictions and a gradual reopening of businesses, including the SHHA office on May 20th while maintaining social distancing norms and hygiene practices. SHHA board members continue to oversee responsibilities assigned in 1995 by the Sandia Peak Tram Company's Architectural Control Committee with operational hours falling between Monday to Friday. In compliance with New Mexico law, property sellers should provide complete disclosures of their property, including any relevant covenants, to prospective buyers prior to concluding the sale. The seller's obligation to disclose SHHA Covenants and community documents is crucial as all Sandia Heights homeowners are bound by them. This disclosure includes community pedestrian safety guidelines for activities such as walking dogs, maintaining visibility, avoiding distractions, and staying alert for personal safety. The article also includes recent stats from Sandia Heights Security, which reported 45 calls in April 2020, related to alarms, suspicious activity, theft, and vandalism. Additional services offered by the SHHA, include emergency alerts via email, member offers like tram passes, copies, safety vests, and notary services. The ACC Chair, Bob Bower, instructs new homeowners to report any home emergencies immediately to SHHA to prevent further damages. Homeowners are also advised to hire only licensed and insured contractors for repairs or modifications to their homes. The article also includes approved ACC projects and advice on attracting hummingbirds, a common bird in New Mexico. Moreover, the pandemic has led to the cancellation of the Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” dining activity. SHHA member Hugh Prather lauded Keith Julian's article in the May issue of The Grit for its insightful dive into post Columbian history, while updates and corrections to The Grit can be found on the SHHA's website.",

The office recently moved and plans to reopen following COVID 19 closures. PNM plans to establish a new substation, sparking opposition from local residents over potential impact on views and property values. Board member Keith Julian gave an overview of the history of the Elena Gallegos Land Grant, initially given to Don Diego Montoya in 1695, and later coming into the possession of Elena Gallegos. SHHA covers the land's ownership journey, its multiple transitions, and its final acquisition by the city, describing its ecological richness. The SHHA has separate security membership, and reports from March 2020 recorded 84 service calls. SHHA member benefits, board meetings information, and notary services can be found on their website. SHHA invites letters from community members for their monthly newsletter, GRIT, imposing certain restrictions and submission guidelines. The \"Cork & Fork\" Dining Activity is paused due to the pandemic but plans to resume upon easing of restrictions. All corrections to GRIT and office status updates can be found on the SHHA website. The office will remain closed on Memorial Day, May 25, 2020.",

Their community responsibilities entail things like approving new constructions, investigating covenant violations, managing the non profit homeowners association, and delivering newsletters. Recent actions taken include cancellation of events due to COVID 19, reminders for census participation, and partnering with the New Mexico Department of Transportation for trash pickup. They don't handle matters like road maintenance, animal complaints, criminal activities, utilities, or covenant revisions. SHHA is battling invasive Siberian Elm trees and encourages residents to fell the trees and apply Garlon 4 to the stumps. The SHHA Office provides free services and merchandise like safety vests and tram passes, reminds residents to clean up after pets and keep them leashed, and shares emergency\/non emergency contact information. They have a Member Benefits Program and issue a resident’s reminder to restrict outdoor lighting for night sky visibility. Approved projects by Architectural Control Committee include window replacements, roofing, solar panels, home additions, and landscaping projects. They implement a Neighborhood Review (NR) system for project feedback. Sandia Heights runs social activities such as a dinner group and sports events through Altamont Little League. SHHA reminds residents should abide by Bernalillo County Ordinance for Light Pollution and suggests alarms, cameras, dogs, or having a TV or radio on as burglary deterrents. The association will cease in person meetings till April 30 because of COVID 19.",

        "content": "The SHHA held their annual meeting on February 22nd, with updates from Board Officers and Committee Chairs: SHHA President, Woody Farber led the Board of Directors and Committee Chairs, and is actively searching for a replacement administrator. Vice President, Emily Rudin, who completed her one year term, has been creating a strategic plan for future operations. Secretary, Susan McCasland, has been instrumental in finalizing monthly Board agendas. The Nominating Committee approved eight new Board Members after a seven month selection period. Treasurer, Cheryl Iverson, reported a higher gross income and net income for 2019 than initially estimated, largely due to contributions from The GRIT and Directory advertising, and Tram ticket sales. The 2020 budget was based on current reserves, projected reserves, and the necessary revenue for homeowners' services. The Finance Committee conducted an internal review, uncovering no significant issues but indicating a need for updated security measures. The Architectural Control Committee approved around 300 projects in 2019, emphasizing a swift 30 day decision making process. Community engagement included Sandia Heights' communal organizations, monthly newsletters, an annual survey, and local events, with the Easter Egg Hunt garnering over 100 child participants. CSC, meeting monthly, monitored and resolved covenant violations, with assistance from the SHHA attorney when necessary. The Parks & Safety committee continued its community upkeep activities, promoted fire risk education, and is planning a future Crime Risk Management Seminar. Community events, corrections to The GRIT, and other information can be found on the SHHA website. In summary, SHHA has seen consistent involvement across board positions, committees, and community members, resulting in operational growth, financial progress, and strengthening community interconnectedness.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights community offers various recreational opportunities though residents face a lack of safety measures such as sidewalks, bike lanes, and crosswalks leading to cautious driving actions and sound road maintenance among homeowners. The community's Services and Membership Committee is seeking to develop more activities for the approximately 465 children in the area. Homeowners with grey water systems are warned to comply with county regulations to avoid violating building codes. A recommended legal option is to have small leach fields installed. The 2020 Annual Meeting agenda includes usual points alongside a Crime Risk Management Seminar and safety precautions for night time activities. It also provides a list of calls made to the Sandia Heights Security Patrol. Other community updates include office schedules, community services and offers, violation logs, approved projects, and community issues like room rentals regulations, trash bin management, and parking arrangements. The community's history discloses its development alongside the Sandia Peak Tramway, significant changes over time, and recreational facilities that are no longer present. Sandia Heights dinner group, a social activity in the area, is open to adult residents. The Homeowners Association shares its observance of Presidents' Day, location details and refers members to its website for any corrections to the printed version of GRIT.",

Plans include a more upscale design, consistent painting, parking area repairs, landscape replacement, and new signage, while leaving the current ATM intact. The Architectural Control Committee of SHHA will help ensure successful refurbishment. SHHA observes stringent Bernalillo County Code related light pollution policies and recommends that heat should not drop below 55°F during winters to prevent pipe damage. Issues with 'bagworms' can be managed through bag handpicking or insecticide. Members can purchase tram passes for $6 or borrow an ACC Color Reference Guide at the SHHA Office. SHHA offers various merchant discounts and reports neighborhood activities, including the Sandia Heights dinner group, Cork & Fork, and open house events. The association currently leads multiple projects such as renovations and reroofing and has raised funds for the La Mesa Arts Academy through the Sandia Heights Art Tour. SHHA is also compiling the 2020 Resident Guide & Directory. They urge residents to make any necessary changes by the November 15 deadline. The SHHA office will close on November 11, and November 28 29 due to Veterans Day and Thanksgiving but will reopen afterward.",

The SHHA is led by President Woody Farber, Vice President Emily Rudin, Secretary Susan McCasland, and Treasurer Cheryl Iverson. More information on SHHA and its benefits can be found on their official website. Residents are reminded to not attract bears with food and to respect wildlife, while additional volunteers are encouraged to join the association's Board of Directors and committees. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is scheduled for October 6 to October 13, featuring numerous activities and fireworks shows. Traffic flow will be modified to outbound only at the end of each event. Sandia Heights Security reported 205 calls in August 2019 involving various matters, however, SHHA membership does not equate to Sandia Heights Security membership. The SHHA also provides various member services, equipment sales, and offers from participating merchants. The Sandia Heights Covenant Support Committee seeks more volunteers to enforce covenants in its 37 unit community. Interested parties can contact SHHA or email sandiaheights@comcast.net. Bob Bower of the Architectural Control Committee provided guidelines for homeowners in emergencies, highlighting the need to inform the SHHA office and vet their contractors properly. The 2019 Resident's survey showed a high satisfaction rate among residents, with safety, covenant enforcement, SHHA effectiveness, and community activities being the key themes. A significant increase in residents recommending Sandia Heights as a place to live was also recorded. Residents were also reminded of safety precautions during Halloween and were informed of upcoming community events and worship times at local churches.",

Alongside opportunities to influence initiatives, the board hosts monthly meetings and an annual photo contest, with the winner's photo to be featured on the 2020 Resident Guide and Directory cover. SHHA is strengthening community practices by sharing tips for proper septic maintenance and requesting that all trash cans be concealed from public view. They also provide sourced contractor evaluations for various services, which are stored in binders for SHHA member access. The Sandia Peak Restaurant has been renamed Ten3, and the office has updated hours and improved benefits, including safety vests and tram passes. The SHHA Annual Survey, available online until August 15th, is a platform for residents to voice their opinions on potential initiatives. Residents receive alerts about health threats such as the Hantavirus and are advised to take precautions against field rodents. Announcements exist for local events, like Sandiago's Grill's paint night and the Sandia Heights Art Tour. A variety of local activities, including the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Orchestra, local church services, dinner groups, and the youth chorus are seeking participants. Lastly, residents should take advantage of the New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax Holiday for tax free shopping.",

        "content": "The Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office, led by Capt. Broderick Sharp and Lt. Vance Lunsford, has initiated strategies to combat burglary in the Sandia Heights region, including the application of high resolution video security systems, getting familiar with neighbors, and promptly reporting suspicious activities. Proposed measures include mandatory participation in Sandia Heights Security, which, although a separate entity from the Homeowners Association, would enforce a $13 monthly security fee. Besides security, the community is also encouraged to adhere to covenants to maintain property aesthetics and values, and participate in the local FireWise programs, using grazing goats and sheep for vegetation management and fire reduction. Sandia Heights Service offers various community services, including water, sewer, trash collection, and security. The Security Patrol provides security stats and emergency contacts while the SHHA is seeking new board members. The community is warned about potential wildfires, barking dogs' disturbances, and the need to apply for alterations to property exteriors via the Architectural Control Committee (ACC). The ACC, which also advises residents on project rules and regulations, has provided logs of recent projects. There are also various community events to look forward to, including painting workshops, art tours, and church services. Corrections or updates to the printed GRIT are available on www.sandiahomeowners.org. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association will resume services from 9 am on July 5, post a closure on July 4 in observance of Independence Day.",

        "content": "The annual meeting of SHHA discussed potential enhancements to W.L. Jackson Park, including more shade, extra picnic tables and a splash pad. The Parks and Recreation Department plans to plant more shade trees, but a splash pad was deemed too expensive. In 2019, SHHA held a Fire Risk Management Seminar with advice from emergency services on pre fire evacuation plans. An Easter Egg Hunt organized by the CS&M committee delighted over 100 children and promoted community togetherness. The Sandia Heights Security has been responding to a variety of calls. The Neighborhood Watch scheme is thought to be effective, hence its endorsement at a community meeting and its signs being installed by SHHA. The ACC has advised property owners to review design plans before proceeding with their projects in order to adhere to guidelines and covenant restrictions. Several construction and restoration projects are underway in Sandia Heights, which are listed on the SHHA website. The Board of Directors is seeking new members. A number of community events are also being organised, including a Democratic Meet and Greet, Painting at Sunset, worship services, and Sandia Heights \"Cork & Fork\" Dining Activity. All changes and event information are relayed via the SHHA website.",

        "content": "At the SHHA Annual Meeting held on February 9, 2019, President Woody Farber discussed a successful goatscaping test project which used goats to clear dense vegetation and reduce fire risk in an eco friendly way. The project, funded by the Board with $1500, was flagged as a feasible method for homeowners to use in Sandia Heights. He reassured that no Board members owned property in the test area. In addition, the meeting covered safety measures and evacuation protocols endorsed by Albuquerque and Bernalillo County Fire & Rescue during the SHHA hosted March Fire Risk Management Seminars. The Sandia Heights Architectural Control Committee (ACC) advised maintaining natural vegetation where possible, but residents can remove dead trees or vegetation, potential fire hazards, if needed. During construction or renovations, the greenery disturbed must be replaced. Stan Hubbard, who took over the Outpost Ice Arena last August, inaugurates the New Mexico Ice Wolves and plans to reopen the renovated arena in May. The homeowner association presented recent reports of incidents in Sandia Heights, such as customer assist calls, attempted break ins, and suspicious persons. It provided emergency contact numbers and information on office hours, meeting times, and services offered by the SHHA. Suggestions on using lower K rating lights to control light pollution were given, requiring ACC approval for outdoor security lights. Lastly, the update finished with a round up of approved housing projects like HVAC replacements, driveway expansions, etc., and community events including an art tour, choir participation, and dining groups. The SHHA office will be closed on Memorial Day.",

        "content": "During SHHA's Annual Meeting, accessibility to recreational trails through arroyos in Sandia Heights was discussed, amid concerns of trespassing on private properties. The parks and safety committee advised getting explicit permission from homeowners or using public routes. The CSC emphasised yard and landscape maintenance importance, particularly in zero lot line areas, and the need for weed control in warmer seasons. With evolving community demographics, property modifications such as living spaces additions, garage upgrades, and revised landscaping are growing, requiring community input and review to ensure they fit neighborhood's architectural harmony. Guidelines state walls or fences should be immediately next to buildings, no more than six feet high (except for special cases), harmony with residential exteriors, only 50% of total living space enclosed, with white or mismatched paint disallowed, and wire fencing prohibited. Community's operation details include Sandia Heights Security Patrol, which keeps records of calls in the area, and office hours, board meetings, service and merchandise availability, and Member Benefits Program that offers discounts at participating merchants. Local attractions include Elena Gallegos Open Space, which offers various amenities for outdoor activities. Construction work updates also include the nearing completion of a two story, 11,000 square foot restaurant on the tram former High Finance Restaurant site, slated to open in May. Other community events include weekly rehearsals by the UNM Health Sciences Center Orchestra, worship times at St. Chad's Episcopal Church, as well as its 'Cork & Fork' event, and calls for young singers by the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus. The SHHA is also hosting an Easter Egg Hunt on April 20th in response to a survey indicating a desire for more children activities. All updates can be found on the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's website.",

        "content": "President Woody Farber highlighted key 2018 achievements including security enhancements, the establishment of written procedures for GRIT articles, and policy revisions. Farber also managed day to day staff operations. Vice President Hugh Prather advocated for SHHA strategic planning and achieved approval for an SHHA resolution; he also contributed to developing a self assessment process for board meetings. Prather, alongside Bob Bower and Emily Rudin, assisted in screening new board applicants. Rudin was later appointed Vice President and Cheryl Iverson assumed the role of treasurer. Secretary Walter Forman performed several duties including participating in a 700 member SHHA survey, finalizing board agendas and confirming the presence of quorums at meetings. Cheryl Iverson, as treasurer, supervised the 2018 budget approval process, resulting in a net gain of $5,302.45. Her report addressed the approved 2019 budget and a successful internal financial procedures review. The Parks & Safety Committee, chaired by Travis Rich, reported a committee member resignation and organized two Tramway cleanups. The committee initiated several safety promoting projects within the community and a subcommittee developed a 10 point Wildfire Preparedness Plan. The Community Service and Membership Committee was reinstated in 2018 after a two year suspension, recruiting six members and executing various outreach activities. The SHHA saw a membership increase from 1,764 to 1,774. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) handled homeowner complaints regarding unit violations, resolving 18 out of the total complaints received. The Communications & Publications Committee (C&P) rejuvenated the committee, standardized the GRIT publication format, and refrained from setting up a social media presence based on survey results. Furthermore, it is considering adding email addresses to the directory and has already selected a new publisher. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) approved a total of 301 applications in 2018 and collaborated with the county on new community developments. Finally, the community was reminded of worship times at St. Chad's Episcopal Church, Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity, New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus enrollment, updates to the GRIT newsletter online, the second Annual Fire Wise Program, and the start of daylight savings time.",

        "content": "The Sandia Heights area, monitored by the Bernalillo County Sheriff Office and Sandia Heights Security, encourages residents to establish strong neighbor relationships for safety. Important contacts for residents include 911 for emergencies, the Sheriff and Fire Departments at 798 7000, and Sandia Heights Security at 263 4654. The subscription based Security Patrol offers services such as alarm response, crime deterrent, and special watch for away residents. The SHHA offers various resources on their website, including meeting minutes, and member information updates. Property owners can retain their SHHA membership even while renting their properties. The Sandia Heights Residents Guide and Directory is considering implementing email addresses for enhanced communication based on residents' preferences, with an \"opt in\" or \"opt out\" option. However, social media plans have been set aside due to privacy concerns, though email alerts will increase and the SHHA website will be upgraded. In December 2018, Sandia Heights Security responded to 236 miscellaneous calls. Office hours are from 9 AM to 4 PM on weekdays, offering free services such as notary, faxing, and copying. Tram passes and safety vests are available for purchase at the SHHA office, alongside member benefits and discounts. A successful \"Goatscaping\" trial took place for wildfire reduction, with around 60 livestock grazing for three days. The ACC approved various projects using the NR process for keeping neighbors informed and seeking feedback. The NR has been key in assessing construction impacts and the ACC requests neighbors to review and comment on proposed blueprint designs and plans. Community activities are numerous and provided to keep residents updated, and the SHHA offices will be closed on February 18, 2019. Corrections to the GRIT version can be found on the SHHA website.",

Similarly, the association reported its covenant violation procedure, and its reception of hospitality discounts from participating merchants. The association also highlighted the new addition to the community, the Boese Brothers Brewpub and provided details on approved construction projects. SHHA aims at improving common areas and enforcing covenants regarding architecture and appearance of the development. The association announced collaboration with North Glenwood Hills associations for projects related to North Tramway Boulevard and an enhanced neighborhood coffee program for new residents. Lastly, the GRIT community announcement included events and opportunities like performances, the Cork & Fork dining activity, and the announcement of the SHHA office closure for Martin Luther King Jr Day.",

The SHHA informs residents to contact the County for snow removal on public roads. Notable members of the SHHA include President Woody Faber, Treasurer Cheryl Iverson, and committee chairs Bob Bower and Travis Rich. The SHHA office is located at 2 B San Rafael Avenue, Albuquerque and operates from 9 am 4 pm on weekdays, excluding federal holidays. In community updates: The SHHA is surveying for potential social media presence. A storage solution was facilitated for Sandia Heights Artists (SHA) in conjunction with the SHHA. Safety advice was given for holiday decorations, event hosting, and protecting water pipes from extreme cold. This includes steps such as insulating outdoor water faucets and allowing a water supply line to drip slowly during extreme cold. Over 2,200 properties in Sandia Heights are obliged to abide by easement restrictions, unit covenants, and County ordinances, including restrictions on altering natural water flow in their private arroyos. The Sandia Heights Security reported a total of 228 calls for October 2018, and SHHA members can avail benefits from various participating merchants listed on the SHHA website. Additionally, Sandia Heights Services, separate from SHHA, offers security, water, sewer, and trash collection services. Joseph Breen won the 2019 SHHA Resident Guide & Directory photo contest, and a notable sighting of three bears was reported by resident Ann Marie Allen in October. Community events and opportunities include a Vivaldi Concert, service through the Church of the Good Shepherd, and support for Casa Q, a shelter for displaced LGBTQ children. Updates on approved projects are available on www.sandiahomeowners.org. The Sandia Heights Art Tour contributed $1,700 to the \"Art in the School\" program, and a host of other communal activities are on offer. SHHA provides benefits such as free notary services, contractor evaluation binders, and email alerts, with safety vests and tram passes available for purchase. The ACC Color Reference guide is available for borrowing with a $20 refundable deposit. Please note that the SHHA Office will be closed from December 24, 2018, to January 1, 2019.",

SHHA is launching a wildfire prevention project in October using goats to clear overgrown vegetation from local arroyos known as potential \"rivers of fire\". Homeowners linked to these areas are encouraged to participate. Information about November 2018 events and services is given, including the end of Daylight Saving Time, early voting and Election Day details, security statistics, member benefits and feedback, as well as news about Sandia Heights Services. SHHA's newsletter also reminds residents about mail security measures and recommends the use of Informed Delivery from USPS for monitoring outgoing letters. Updates on ongoing and approved construction and maintenance projects in Sandia Heights are mentioned, along with insights into the density of communication and broadcast antennas in the area. Community activities and groups seeking members or participants include Chestra, an amateur orchestra; the Sandia Heights Cork & Fork Dining Activity; and the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus interested parties are supplied with requisite contact details. General announcements include SHHA office hours and services, holiday office closures, information on the upcoming board meeting, and the 2019 SHHA Resident Guide & Directory's annual photo contest.",

        "content": "The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) is promoting community cohesion and resilience through new initiatives and reminders for members: SHHA now offers a voter registration service, facilitated by Betsy Rodriguez and Jessica Seeley, to increase convenience for members. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) has reiterated rules regarding long term parking of recreational vehicles, trailers, and boats in community spaces. SHHA members are advised to provide necessary changes for the 2019 Resident Guide and Directory before the deadline on October 26th, 2018. Households are encouraged to prepare a \"go bag\" for possible emergencies, particularly wildfires. The bag should contain important items such as insurance documents, medical supplies, food, and essentials for pets. Two new housing developments, \"Hawks Landing\" and \"Las Pradas,\" are under construction, despite residents' expressed desire for the spaces to stay vacant. SHHA members can access numerous online services and alerts through a simple email registration process. SHHA is preparing for the 2018 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta which will feature events like laser light shows, balloon launches, and an AfterGlow™ Fireworks Show. Acknowledging the nighttime environment as a crucial natural resource, SHHA supports the International Dark Sky Association, which highlights the significant impact artificial lights can have on our interaction with the natural night sky. Other community activities include the 2018 Sandia Heights Art Tour, job vacancies at local institutions, the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Orchestra, and a photo contest for the Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory. In addition to these initiatives, SHHA is ensuring the separation of subscription services and association membership, and continues to uphold community standards.",

        "content": "As children return to school, the Parks and Safety Committee suggests maintaining safety norms across different modes of transportation like walking, biking, and taking the bus. To avoid injuries, kids should use ergonomically designed backpacks not exceeding 20% of their body weight, play in soft surfaced playgrounds under adult supervision, and residents should follow fire prevention measures. Recent damage was caused due to a wildfire in the Sandia Heights community. Initiatives hosted by the SHHA include community cleanups and a photo contest, with an overall drop seen in fireworks usage. RK accepts donations for their service. Residents are urged to abide by pet management rules for community comfort. Bernalillo County Ordinances house further details on animal related norms. SHHA Board projects like home improvements and renovations are underway with Resident sentiment towards the community is positive, as shown in a recent survey. Bob Bower of ACC cautions against online locksmith scams. Other community updates include requirements for a daycare\/nursery worker, Sandia Heights Art Tour, and recruitment for the UNM Health Sciences Center Orchestra. Sandia Heights residents can enjoy a dining group named “Cork & Fork,” and purchase tram tickets on a first come, first served basis. For tax free shopping, New Mexico has a tax free holiday from August 3rd to August 5th, 2018. Corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the SHHA's official website.",

        "content": "On May 15, 2018, the High Desert community evaded a significant wildfire that originated in an underpopulated drainage filled with grass, shrubs, and trees. Occurring under warm, dry and windy conditions, it threatened residences, damaged communication lines, and prompted a discussion regarding emergency preparedness; it emphasized fire prevention and enforced a fireworks ban for unincorporated county regions. Notices encourage reporting illegal fireworks use, and a Wildfire Preparedness Committee has been established by the SHHA to guide residents. It recommends creating a safe space around houses, crafting evacuation plans, packing an emergency \"go bag,\" teaching family members to disconnect utilities, preparing for pet evacuation, keeping an emergency weather radio, and having a list of items to grab during an evacuation. Also, Public Utility Easements (PUEs) are present at most residences' property edges, allowing utility companies to install underground utilities. Residents are urged to report damage, though the county is not responsible for any drains outside these easements. The Fire Department encourages residents to clean chimneys and stove pipes after wood heating seasons to avoid fire hazards. Volunteers' role is highlighted in firefighting and to address current shortfalls, additional training will be offered. Additionally, residents are reminded of community events, including dining activities, art tours, and job opportunities through newsletters. SHHA office at Albuquerque, New Mexico, will be closed for Independence Day on July 4th, with any corrections to newsletters available on the SHHA website.",

        "content": "From April 1st to October 31st, 2018, Bernalillo County enforced water restriction regulations prohibiting the use of sprinkler irrigation from 11am 7pm, excluding methods like drip irrigation or hand watering. These regulations were to prevent water wastage, which, if violated, could be reported to the Bernalillo County Water Waste Hotline. The county recommended certain home water conservation strategies and the use of rainwater collection, and offered incentive programs for conservation efforts. Additionally, the county imposed bans on the use and sale of certain fireworks, particularly in wildland areas and unincorporated parts of the county, to prevent property damage and potential fire hazards. Dead tree cutting and removal were advised especially in fire prone areas and residents, particularly in Sandia Heights, were encouraged to maintain their landscapes. Additional rules included light regulation to maintain dark skies, with outdoor lighting prohibited between 11 p.m. and sunrise. SHHA offered a range of discount programs for members and services including security, water, sewer, and trash collection. The community underwent various property improvements and SHHA facilitated community involvement through surveys and co existence strategies with local wildlife. The local community bulletin board provided details about community events and the SHHA office provided various member services and resources. To receive community alerts, members were instructed to subscribe via email. Corrections regarding the printed version of the GRIT could be accessed on the SHHA website. The physical address for the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association is 2 B San Rafael Ave. NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.",

        "content": "The SHHA's new executive team, led by President Woody Farber, is elaborating on the past achievements and has outlined a Strategic Planning process that prioritizes serving the Sandia Heights residents' ever changing needs. Key initiatives include: Community Service & Membership Committee, chaired by Hugh Prather, is processing ideas gathered from breakout sessions for possible implementation. Creation of a Sandia Heights evacuation plan by a special committee, aiming to raise awareness, develop community notification and evacuation strategies, promote individual preparation actions, and liaise with government resources. The Publications and Communications committee is actively seeking volunteers in areas such as writing, editing, and webpage design. In response to multiple violations, residents are reminded to respect regulations such as those relating to RV\/Pop up Camper Trailers, exterior alterations, and trash\/debris accumulation. Bernalillo County Commission and U.S. Forest Service have imposed restrictions on open fires, campfires, smoking, and firework use due to increasing wildfire risks. To prepare for wildfire threats, a Wildfire Preparedness Planning Committee (WPPC) is developing plans to minimize damage and ensure residents' safe evacuation. The SHHA office is enhancing its website for residents' improved use and is focusing on approved development projects. Events such as trash cleanup are organized by the SHHA Parks & Safety Committee for maintenance and beautification purposes. The community is encouraged to participate in various activities, including a photo contest for the 2019 Sandia Heights Resident Guide, sharing stories about ‘The GRIT’, the annual studio art tour by the Sandia Heights Artists, and joining the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus.. SHHA members can enjoy certain exclusive benefits and participate in local events like \"Cork & Fork\". The office which provides certain free services to members will be closed on May 28, in observance of Memorial Day.",

        "content": "Forming a Neighborhood Watch program can enhance security in any geographically structured area. The program starts with a resident hosting a meeting and contacting the local Neighborhood Coordination Specialist. Half of the homes on the block must participate to qualify for sign placement and the block can then purchase Neighborhood Organized Against Crime signs. The usage of drones is increasing but can pose public safety concerns. Neither the State of New Mexico nor Bernalillo County has specific drone regulations and Sandia Heights also lacks specific drone rules, but unlawful actions could lead to charges. Sandia Heights Security handles drone related complaints; if criminal activities are discovered, they contact the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office. Timothy P. Garcia, a mail carrier for Sandia Heights, retired in March, and the community is inviting entries for an annual photo contest. The SHHA invites information sharing and accepts article submissions until the 10th of every month. The threat of wildfires was discussed at a Tijeras meeting, stressing the importance of \"defensible spaces\" for protection from wildfires. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) approved several projects, many of which involve renovating property exteriors. Sandia Heights Services (SHS) provides security, water, sewer, and waste management. Bernalillo County's Code Enforcement team services unincorporated areas like Sandia Heights, educating the public about County codes, and responding to resident concerns. The SHHA Office offers several services to members including notary services, a contractor evaluation binder, $2 safety vests, and $6 tram passes sold on a first come, first served basis. They also have ACC Color Reference Guides for members to borrow. The SHHA Office is located at 2 B San Rafael Ave. NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.",

        "content": "Joe Pappe concluded his service of 8 years on the SHHA Board of Directors and introduced new leadership, including Woody Farber as President and Hugh Prather as Vice President. During his term, Pappe spearheaded SHHA office security upgrades, revisions of office staff titles and job descriptions, among other accomplishments. In annual reports, Vice President Emily Rudin highlighted her strategic planning and Secretary Bob Bower discussed the regular conduct of business. The Treasurer Woody Farber shared financial details, including 2017 Budget Results and the approved 2018 budget. The SHHA's annual report underscored the notable contributions of various committees, such as the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) which resolved 47 covenant related complaints. The committee, made of members from diverse backgrounds, also published helpful community related information in The GRGIT. Regularly maintained official records, security patrol call stats, and details of independent services separate from SHHA membership were also covered in the report. Other highlights include the annual photo contest, the Member Benefits program, and the Tram Pass program with a 78% usage rate. The report recognized the efforts of several committees such as the Community Service and Membership Committee, and the Communications and Publications Committee. The Architectural Control Committee, ensuring the visual appeal of the community, handled about 300 projects in 2017. The SHHA website features updates on community events and opportunities, like the 15th annual art tour by Sandia Heights Artists and the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus. Office hours, Board Meetings, and members' services like notary services, copies, email alerts, and a contractor evaluation binder are available. The Association's site also hosts a calendar with the schedule of committee meetings and a classified ads section.",

        "content": "In October and November, nine volunteers joined the Board of Directors of the SHHA, alleviating a crucial staffing shortage. These new members bring a variety of experiences and innovative ideas, intending to better serve the SHHA's members. The association disseminated information on how to limit unsolicited marketing calls, mail, and emails by registering for the Federal Trade Commission's National Do Not Call Registry or the Direct Marketing Association's mail and commercial email reduction options. Residents were reminded of the covenants against storing large vehicles such as RVs and commercial trucks on their properties. They were also urged to utilize forms on the association's website to report any violations, ensuring anonymity. The community was encouraged to enjoy outdoor walks, provided they adhere to safety guidelines such as walking on the left side of the road and maintaining a 2 ft clearance of vegetation from the road. The American Red Cross, in partnership with the Bernalillo County Fire Department, is offering free smoke detector installations. Meanwhile, residents were reminded that membership in the SHHA does not cover security, water, sewer, and waste collection services. The GRIT, the association's newsletter, provided tips for holiday lighting safety, snow removal, and avoiding rodent poison. An article on poinsettia care throughout the seasons was featured, and the SHHA's recent events, including a Volunteer Appreciation Luncheon and new project approvals, were highlighted. Additionally, the community was informed about a new local coffee shop and social activities such as \"Cork & Fork\" bimonthly group dinners. The association posted their office hours and a reminder to check their website for member benefits. Lastly, SHHA's special office schedule for Christmas and New Year was conveyed to the community members.",

        "content": "Joe Pappe, President of the GRIT Association, raised concerns about the future of the organization due to insufficient volunteers, potentially leading to dissolution, but recent volunteers and proposed structural changes to the Board and Committee have led to increased optimism. An annual meeting in February aims to propose changes for membership voting to protect future organizational sustainability. The Association reinforces the importance of submitting architectural project applications to the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) for community guideline adherence. To prevent covenant violation, the ACC requires plat plans or surveys for significant construction projects and encourages members to consult with them for project advice. Open Board meetings, held the second Wednesday each month, welcome all members’ comments and concerns. Winter preparations for water pipes are advised, and violations like trash accumulation and lack of ACC approval are noted. In September 2017, 257 calls were logged, with 193 being special requests, alongside issues such as alarms, theft, and loud music. SHHA listed benefits and participating merchants offering discounts to members. Articles emphasized covenant adherence, appropriate vehicle storage, and landscaping guidelines. Issues like pinon tree fungi infection are also monitored. The GRIT, ACC, Sandia Heights Services, and SHHA work collaboratively on various community projects, available for reference on the Sandia Homeowners website. SHHA responded to crime concerns with eight new \"Area Patrolled by Security\" signs, in partnership with the Parks and Safety Committee and local law enforcement. SHHA offers various free services and resources for its members, including notarization, photocopies, e mail alerts, and contractor evaluations. Paid resources like safety vests, tram passes, and classified ads are offered online. The SHHA Office, located at 2 B San Rafael Ave. NE, observes holiday closures, and resources like the ACC Color Reference Guide are available for lending, with cash or check payments accepted for sales and deposits.",

        "content": "President Joe Pappe of the Association has reported concerns about a dearth of volunteers willing to serve on the Board of Directors, an issue threatening the Association's continuation into 2019; this could result in the loss of services, committees, and the potential drop in property values due to lack of architectural and covenant enforcement. The future of the Association will be decided in November, however, residents are encouraged to volunteer to ensure the continuation of services. Updates prompt residents to verify their Resident Directory listing, follow property rental rules, and report drone invasion of privacy to the County Commissioner. The Sandia Heights' Homeowners Association is unable to act on anonymous correspondence; Residents are advised to view updates on their website. Community security reports have been revealed including cases of vandalism and animal control issues, and the Homeowners Association is organising an annual photo contest for the cover of the 2018 Resident Guide. The Association cautions against feeding local wildlife which disrupts ecosystems and may violate State Wildlife laws. The need for a new Chair for the Communications and Publications Committee has been expressed; the commitment measures up to 15 hours a month involving various duties related to internal and external communication. The Association has also implemented a discount initiative with various local merchants. In observation of Columbus Day, the SHHA office will be closed on October 9th, 2017; Membership cards and tram passes are purchasable at discounted rates for members. Community events include concerts with the Albuquerque Philharmonic Orchestra, worship times at St Chad's Episcopal Church, and auditions for New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus. Corrections to the printed GRIT can be found on the Sandia Heights' website.",

        "content": "The President of an association, with over 1,700 members, seeks support and additional volunteers to combat apathy and sustain the much desired Albuquerque community. The findings of a time survey demonstrate reasonable time commitments for Officer roles, underscored by the necessity of volunteers for the Association's continuation according to the By laws. To entice participation, the Association offers a new, dynamic color guide for home projects available at the office, a refresh of their monthly newsletter – including an ACC activity log, member benefits, and community updates, and emphasis on member input under certain guidelines. Frequently asked questions about property covenants and their enforcement have been shared to reinforce the importance of homeowner compliance. Residents are encouraged to volunteer and warned against hiring unlicensed contractors, alongside reminders of upcoming community events. Key points include: Necessity of volunteers replacing outgoing Board members to continue Association's operations Release of a new, dynamic color guide and regular newsletter updates Continued emphasis on member input following specific guidelines Importance of homeowner involvement in maintaining compliance with property covenants Warning against hiring unlicensed contractors Frequent community events and opportunities for residents.",

        "content": "Outgoing SHHA President, Joe Pappe warns of the association's instability due to a decreasing number of board members, with efforts to recruit new volunteers yielding no results. He emphasizes the importance of the association, which serves to preserve property value in Sandia Heights through various activities. Notably: Guidelines were provided for maintaining a professional environment on construction sites. Suggestions were made on proper maintenance to prevent high tree mortality rates in Albuquerque. A successful Fourth of July parade was held in Sandia Heights, with a potential suggestion of making it an annual event. Sandia Heights Services, a subscription offering essential community services, has shared statistics of various community related issues. The Covenant Support Committee seeks volunteers to help maintain neighborhood standards, including preventing short term rentals like Airbnb, a potential security threat. The 2018 Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory's annual photo contest is open for entries until November 3, with various completed projects approved since the last GRIT. In real estate, executive brokers and RE\/MAX associates, Sharon and Judson McCollum, continue to promote property value growth in Sandia Heights through their extensive marketing. Community events include the availability of free tram passes and the fourth annual Sandia Heights Artists' studio tour in September. St. Chad's Episcopal Church, Albuquerque extends an open invitation to their worship services, and the Sandia Heights \"Cork & Fork\" dinner group continues to meet bimonthly. The New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus is seeking passionate singers from grades 4 through 12, while the SHHA invites member feedback and article submissions. Other updates include meeting dates, office hours, and available services from the SHHA office. Members can access a list of companies offering discounts on the website.",

        "content": "Captain Joshua Kingsbury invites SHHA residents to a \"Meet and Greet\" on Thursday, May 4, to discuss current safety activities and future plans, at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Attendees are asked to observe standard etiquette. VP Emily Rudin encourages homeowners to maintain property appeal and value through various improvements, whilst adhering to deed restrictions. She also endorses safety guidelines for outdoor activities. Instructions for pack rat control include elimination of nests and nesting opportunities, usage of live traps, taking care of parasites, and preventing re nesting. A total of 196 reported cases encompass issues like customer assistance, suspicious vehicles, noise complaints, thefts, family disputes, etc. SHHA follows Robert's Rules of Order for smooth and efficient meetings, respecting the rights of all attendees. Available properties are described in detail, and light pollution restrictions according to Sandia Heights Unit Covenants are highlighted. SHHA doesn't enforce county regulations but urges volunteering for the Covenant Support Committee (CSC), emphasizing ACC's role during construction or landscaping processes. The ACC Activity Log lists approved projects, with more details available at www.sandiahomeowners.org. Realtors Sharon and Judson McCollum offer free Market Analysis for Sandia Heights properties. Worship services are held at St Chad's, and auditions for The New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus are ongoing for students from grade 4 12. Information regarding office hours, board meeting, and services offered to SHHA members can be found on the SHHA website, with the office selling safety vests and tram passes.",

Secretary Bob Bower stated past meeting information would be available on the SHHA website, and highlighted an article on garden maintenance and local wildlife issues. The article also discussed security statistics and prevention measures for burglaries in the area, advised by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office, including forming relationships with neighbours and reporting suspicious activities. Residents are also reminded to comply with lighting and parking regulations to maintain the neighbourhood’s pleasure and safety. The SHHA offers guidance to residents who wish to propose covenant amendments and provides updates on violation activities. The SHHA newsletter also includes film reviews, most recently praising the Marvel movie \"Dr. Strange\". In terms of architecture, several properties were permitted for improvements, and real estate executive brokers Judson and Sharon McCollum, who have a 25 year history with Sandia Heights, continue to promote properties in the area. Three modern homes in the Sandia Heights area were highlighted for their luxury features and expansive views. The SHHA sponsors events and services including member benefits such as office resources, safety vests, tram passes, and community wide activities.",

As of June 1st, SHHA has ceased its free tram pass service, which was previously eight corporate passes per day. Now, each pass will cost $5, with no allowances for deposits, refunds, or cancellations. As a response to the ongoing drought and increased fire risk, the Bernalillo County Commission imposed fire restrictions on March 25, 2014, lasting for 180 days. The SHHA had a successful Easter Egg Hunt, enjoyed by members and attendees despite weather conditions. Property owners can pass on SHHA membership dues to their tenants via utility bills. This grants renters access to membership benefits, barring voting rights and file covenant violation complaints ability. More volunteers are needed in the Covenant Support Committee to investigate covenant violations quickly to maintain property value. George Connor of the Parks and Safety Committee provides cycling safety tips for bikers and motorists, while Sandia Heights Services offers security suggestions like securing all entry points to houses to reduce burglaries. The Parks & Safety Committee urges homeowners to cut back thick vegetation near driveways to improve visibility, and issues related to such should be reported to SHHA office.

The community is reminded of the differences between SHHA and SHS as separate entities. The importance of proper disposal of garbage and burglary prevention is emphasized. Queries related to coexistence with local wildlife should be directed to the Sandia Heights Wildlife Steward. Securing trash bins and bird feeders during bear hibernation season is crucial. Despite homes built after 1983 not being in floodplains, securing home loans without National Flood Insurance may pose a problem due to third party miscalculations. Appeals to mortgage companies can be assisted by Bernalillo County's Floodplain administrator. Residents are reminded of the prohibition of long term RV parking. Complaints received regarding this issue are addressed by the homeowners association and CSC, supported by the judicial system. Office hours, community meetings, and services like notary, copies, faxes, and safety vests are detailed.

These amendments were open for review on the SHHA website. SHHA also initiated a holiday food drive with the Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, providing a collection point for non perishable items at their San Rafael and Tramway offices, thanking all participants. The association also runs a merchant program offering discounts to members from various services providers if the property owners maintain membership with the SHHA. SHHA sends out a GRIT newsletter that sends alerts about activities in Sandia Heights, including wildlife alerts and security issues. On the topic of security, SHHA offers an array of security tips but mainly emphasizes on light pollution, encouraging homeowners to abide by the Bernalillo County Code, which mandates that all lights must be off between 11:00 pm and sunrise. Precautionary measures for homes during winter are urgently advised, especially for homes' exteriors and water supply lines. The SHHA recommends disconnecting water hoses and protecting outdoor faucets to prevent freezing damage. Furthermore, the SHHA website also provides updates about maintenance and upgrade projects in the neighborhood. Max Sanchez was highlighted for his achievement in 2012 as a Coldwell Banker agent. The newsletters also provide updates on community services, events, and hours of operation. The SHHA hosts a monthly \"Cork & Fork\" dining activity and encourages new members to participate in this communal gathering, the contact person being Al, reachable at 856 1984 or mariaratner@msn.com. The association's address is 2 B San Rafael Ave NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.",

As a result, a special meeting is to be held at the Church of The Good Shepherd on November 9 for voting on three proposed amendments. These amendments aim to reduce the board member minimum from 14 to 11 and can be previewed on the SHHA website. The GRIT publication gains financial support primarily from ad revenues, urging residents to patronize the advertised businesses. Resident directory listings must be updated or confirmed by November 10, 2013. The SHHA office routinely handles covenant violation complaints with an established procedure for reporting and resolving these violations. For safety, residents are advised against leaving valuable items in their cars, ignoring knocks when home, and leaving garage remotes in cars. Free sales and marketing consultations are offered by Pete Veres of Elite Asset Management team. The ACC urges homeowners to submit design and construction plans for early approval to ensure compliance with Unit covenants and ACC Design Guidelines. Residents must report any alterations that diverge from approved plans, even minor changes, to maintain covenant compliance. The ACC provides Design Guidelines focused on aspects such as Detached Buildings, Landscaping, Roofing, Setbacks and Variances, Solar Collectors, and Walls and Fences. Services at the Church of Good Shephard, events like \"I Do!\" hosted by the Sandia Presbyterian Church, and the annual Blessing of Animals at St. Chad's Episcopal Church are additional community offerings highlighted. Sandia Heights Artists thank attendees of their Studio Art Tour and hope for continued attendance in their future events. Al and Marie Ratner have taken over management of the \"Cork & Fork\" dining event. The SHHA invites community members to submit entries for its annual photo contest with the winning photograph to be featured on the cover of Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide 2014. The entries should be related to Sandia Heights and cannot be submitted by professional photographers.",

A resident had encountered unauthorized bow hunters on her property, which prompted the SHHA to advise residents on seeking written consent from landowners before allowing hunters to traverse private lands to access public lands. Widespread mail theft prompted a call to secure outgoing mail by taking it directly to the post office and storing important documents in secure locations. An uptick in installations of energy saving \"cool roofs\" required the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to remind residents that white roofs are not allowed, due to covenant restrictions. Guidelines recommend a Solar Reflectance (SR) or Light Reflectance Value (LRV) below 65 and outside wall materials must harmonize with the overall building design. In addition, it was announced how SHHA members could benefit from daily tram passes, office and notary services, discounted safety vests and more. The SHHA emphasized that the Sandia Heights Security (SHS) is separate from the SHHA and informed residents about safety measures during bad weather, including pedestrians walking facing traffic. Advertisements included a feature from real estate agent Max Sanchez, an upcoming performance from Syd Masters & the Swing Riders, and an overview of approved ACC projects.

To address the concern of obstructed views by trees, the Community Services & Membership Committee (CS&MC) introduced the SHHA Tree Removal Lottery, which allows residents to remove certain trees for free, albeit with rules and specifications, by applying and showing proof of removal. The winners, selected during the SHHA Annual Meeting in June 2010, would get up to $750 per tree for removal expenses.

SHHA covers both Sandia Heights and High Desert housing communities, each with contrasting environments. Sandia Heights features large, picturesque rural settings with a 15 mph speed limit, while High Desert contains smaller urban lots with fast four lane roads and a speed limit of 35 mph. Both areas pose safety concerns due to residents sharing space with motorist traffic, which SHHA aims to mitigate through promoting safety measures and maintaining clear roads. SHHA also offers various amenities and services to its members, encourages non member participation, and hosts social events like the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series. The association keeps a keen eye on security and maintains processes for reporting suspicious activities. Denver based musicians Acoustic Eidolon will be performing in January 2009, as part of the Coffeehouse Concert Series. SHHA recommends supporting local services and businesses advertised in the GRIT newsletter, which is also accessible on their website.

Among other successful activities, road paving projects were initiated within Sandia Heights, and members were encouraged to participate. The county's Operation and Maintenance Director gave a rundown on the process of the county's handling of traffic issues, following state law standards. The county conducted a speed study on San Rafael Avenue and plans to present results at a town hall meeting which also presents local residents with a chance to meet and ask questions from the officials involved. The treasurer's report revealed a positive cash flow with cash inflows at $13,275.55 and outflows at $11,726.36, and an overall bank & cash of $171,216.29. In efforts to build valuable resources for the community, the SHHA encouraged the use of a contractor evaluation form for services availed by residents. To improve resident experience and safety, the concern about lacking foot trails leading to pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists, sharing roadways with automotive traffic was addressed, and residents were advised to use visibility vests for safety, the vests being supplied by SHHA. Recycling was also discussed, Larry the manager of SHS suggesting a drop off zone for recyclables considering the prohibitive cost and time of curbside recycling pickup. The Architectural Control Committee approved several projects but declined a storage shed at 636 Cougar Loop and 2875 Brushwood Street.

For instance, at 1913 Quail Run Drive, numerous improvements were approved, with the exception of the Ponderosa pine due to possible obstruction of views. SOSH is planning a variety of events, including a backstage tour at the Opera, Chile supper, and concert at Lensic Theater. There's a conflict of interest regarding a proposed T Mobile cell tower. While better connectivity is desired, many are concerned about the obstruction of views. Further information and resources are available on the SHHA website at www.sandiahomeowners.org. The statement ends with wishes for a safe Fourth of July holiday and postage information.",

A successful proposal led by Aidan Thompson and Ann Desing to improve a school bus stop was executed, amidst unfortunate office break ins. Construction on W.L. Jackson Park continues and community activities are plentiful, including book clubs, playgroups and gourmet clubs, as well as events such as the Art tour and Annual Wine Tasting Event. Residents interested in joining various committees can review the beige pages of the 2006 Directory and should be prepared for required committee service and monthly board meetings. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) listed new architectural projects and called for volunteers to help enforce neighborhood convenants. In crime prevention, Detective Ray Chavez stressed the importance of avoiding predictable key hideaways, securing doors, and reporting suspicious activities. Information from February 2006 recorded local security incidents including break ins and alarms. The SHHA is consolidating its regulations and standardizing the covenant system for better governance, preserving property values, and improving homeowners' benefits.

        "content": "Marsha Thole and Bobby Baker, the Bernalillo County Traffic Engineer, have been investigating the causes of lengthy wait times at local intersections. Key findings include a 90 second wait time during peak hours, with unused green light time being shifted to the main line, and potential issues with vehicle recognition from lack of detection cameras and sunlight glare. It was recommended that anyone experiencing traffic signal problems should contact Baker. Community news includes the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's (SHHA) call for volunteer support for administrative tasks, including website management, legal advice, and board representation. The group has also flagged a new wastewater ordinance aimed at resolving prior conflicts and bringing local laws into line with changes at the state level, with details on the rule changes for property improvements and community developments. A new walking path from Little Cloud Park has also been announced, representing the first stage of a broader network of trails. The SHHA is pushing for greater community involvement in capital improvement projects, with calls for volunteers to write proposals for traffic, safety, and parks projects. SHHA has clarified its position on street speed bumps by stating homeowners from the affected streets have complete control over whether speed humps are installed, with the county having clear guidelines for the installation process. Bernalillo County recently installed speed humps on Tramway Lane after residents' petitions, and the first Sandia Heights Coffeehouse at Church of the Good Shepherd was deemed a success with approximately 70 attendees. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) in Sandia Heights will be launching a new feature called GRIT to keep residents informed of local construction activities, while State Representative Kathy McCoy has highlighted issues expected in the upcoming legislative session, including the state budget. The Sandia Heights Security (SH Security) offers a response time averaging 2 4 minutes and logs for 2005 include attempts at burglaries and various disputes. However, membership to the SHHA doesn't guarantee services from SH Security, with homeowners encouraged to check their status on their monthly utility bill. Finally, The Flower Company is delighted to announce a new branch that opened in January 2006, which offers a range of plant products and worldwide delivery services through FTD and Teleflora, with unique offers such as a dozen roses for $10.95 and \"Happy Hour,\" a 2 for 1 cut flowers deal.

They've formed a committee to stay updated on related issues. The First Sandia Heights Coffeehouse is planned to occur on January 14, featuring Acoustic Eidolon and requesting a $15 donation. To improve community connectivity, the Parks and New Development Committee have planned a walking path project, for which they've secured funds. They're also contemplating acquiring an access easement to the National Forest open space, and have sanctioned $200 to enhance a school bus stop. Following a rise in local vandalism, they've requested Sandia Heights Security's help and are encouraging residents to stay alert. They've asked for resident feedback to regulate building aesthetics and have listed out their responsibilities. Rio Grande Ace Hardware, a new outlet housing over 20,000 products, will open soon and revolutionize the home improvement shopping experience. For traffic safety and environmental issues, SHHA requests residents to directly contact Bernalillo County Dispatch. They also advocate for responsible driving at 15 mph and provide a process for addressing speed concerns. The SHHA office functions on weekdays and is run by an executive team: President Ed Whitten, VP Thomas Coyne, Treasurer Dick Cline, and Secretary Marsha Thole.

The size should not exceed 20% of the primary residence, should blend in with the primary house's style to avoid reducing property values, and should adhere to setback provisions. A financial report for August 2003 was given by Cheryl Iverson showing total cash of $49,080.88 and total assets of $63,777.88 with liabilities of $24,028.50. The possible unification of Albuquerque and Beralillo County sparked a debate on potential tax base expansion and loss of residents' operational control influence over the unified governance. Homeowner association communities have increased 21% since 1998 in the U.S, offering cities and counties benefits, but also fostering conflicts necessitating third party or court resolution. In Sandia Heights community, the introduction of discounts on membership cards and organizing events like concerts are enhancing the community feeling. However, potential issues such as accidents involving cars and bikes, blocked views due to excessive vegetation, and damage to pine trees due to beetles have emerged. These could be controlled by obeying speed limits, maintaining property vegetation, and removing affected trees. The SHHA has evolved to handle these responsibilities, including covenant enforcement. They now have an office, a website, have developed various public areas, and have established procedures for recruitment and dismissal of staff. Hearings have been raised regarding speeding by local teenagers and increasing security measures. Consequently, membership and active participation in the SHHA are encouraged. The benefits of switching to refrigerated air conditioners are highlighted alongside their potential rise in operating costs. A public announcement was made for the third annual Holiday Lights featuring affordable electric luminaria sets available for purchase. There is a detailed gardening schedule for October and November to prepare gardens for fall and the upcoming 2021 planting season. Various events are also described such as, the Sandia Mountain field trip in August and residents are encouraged to partake in these community building endeavors.",

Concerns about the growing disregard for local guidelines in Sandia Heights community, including unauthorized construction projects, visible material storage, and inappropriate parking, need to be addressed urgently to preserve the area's unique character. Residents are suggested to periodically review Unit Covenants, interact with neighbors about concerns, and report any violations to the Covenant Support Committee (CSC). SHHA is gearing up for an audit of the previous year's accounting records and is seeking volunteers with relevant experience. It is essential for residents to adhere to their annual membership fees obligation for the community's sustenance. There are several available services in the community, including plumbing, heating, cooling, tax law, estate law, business law, jewelry repair, landscape design, and home services provided by various local businesses. Potential community changes like enhancing commercial presence along Tramway Blvd, altering residential lawns during persistent drought, and a proposed regional Water Control Board could have a lasting impact on Sandia Heights and the City\/County Unification. Issues such as the potential use of Cedar Hill Park and demands from property owners to build walls around their lots are also prevalent. The benefits of recirculating air conditioning systems equipped with electrostatic filters for allergy sufferers, its electricity efficiency, and the cost saving advantage of reusable filters have been highlighted. A common installation error of replacing a swamp cooler with an air conditioner and adding a single return duct is addressed. The differing functioning mechanism of both systems needs separate treatment. For dual swamp cooler houses, the suggestion of installing a high capacity air conditioner at one and using the other as a return duct system is proposed. The importance of strategic airflow and preventing potential mold formation due to condensation from cool ducts is underscored. Professional advice is recommended for addressing uncertainties during conversion.",

Participated in the Sandia Pueblo settlement. Made substantial contribution towards Cedar Hill Park's development. Conducted a resident survey and attended CityCounty Unification Charter Commission meetings. Smoothly transitioned roles from old to new officers. Welcomed five new board members and reelected three SHHA Board members. Suggestions for discounted local business services for SHHA members were initiated by the Service & Membership Committee while the Covenant Support Committee addressed several covenant violations. Communications & Publications, led by Rick Nelson, garnered a surplus from advertisement revenue. Cedar Hill Park was a primary focus, with productive planning meetings and generous financial and design contributions leading to construction commencement. Despite budget limitations, other smaller scale activities were also completed. The year's financial report revealed total earnings of $137,297.26 against expenditures of $144,707.93. Concurrently, the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) approved 144 projects while ensuring these remained compliant with established covenants. The ACC developed internal guidelines to guarantee consistent and fair decisions regarding construction and renovation projects. They emphasized covenant conformance, including for unclear restrictions, and encouraged homeowner involvement in their meetings. A particular attention area was the rising wall\/fence construction applications. Finally, the Traffic, Safety, and Environment Committee focussed on environment preservation and safety initiatives. These included measures to control dog waste, prevent accelerated erosion, manage community street safety and upkeep roadside appearance through vegetation management. The committee's uncertain investigation into Sandia Heights to National Forest access legality signals a need for user respect and propriety. Any parties interested in natural gas services were advised to contact SHEA's office. The board ends its report with well wishes for the 4th of July and noting the payment of presorted standard U.S. postage, with permit #375 in Albuquerque.",

Established over 30 years ago, the community was intended to have aminimal impact on wildlife, native vegetation, and water supply, and the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association was created in 1978 to protect residents' interests. There is an ongoing initiative to update these Unit covenants and input from residents is encouraged. A successful Wine Tasting and Silent Auction has also made it likely for a second event to occur in October. The committee has successfully organized events and is considering moving the annual Spring wine tasting to late April for better weather, as well as a “Spring Fling” picnic around August or September at a suitable park yet to be chosen. The board is seeking volunteers, especially from districts that will not be represented after June, for forthcoming vacancies and are encouraging potential candidates to apply. Upcoming park improvements are also being discussed, with a suggestion to provide feedback on an update including meeting to discuss the design for Cedar Hill Park. The Parks Committee has identified issues that need addressing in Little Cloud Park which recently received herbicide granules to prevent GoatHead seeds. To improve conditions, fertilizer has been placed around trees, regular watering is scheduled between March and November, and if a GoatHead plant is spotted, pulling it up is recommended. The SHHA Board is addressing issues including speeding, fire protection, commercial development, park improvements, security, mountain trail access, view protection, and covenants. They are asking for detailed feedback from users to improve these areas, particular in regards to improvements and solutions for Little Cloud Park.",

Along with the adoption of new regulations, the annual meeting will also serve as a platform for electing new board members, discussing the future of Cedar Hill Park, and deliberating potential impacts of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County's proposed unification on Sandia Heights. The board also emphasized the role of the Traffic & Safety Committee in ensuring residents' safety, despite criticism over the use of speed humps as traffic calming measures. The Architectural Control Committee will continue reviewing plans of new construction and renovation projects within Sandia Heights for alignment with the neighborhood's restrictive covenants. The revised bylaws aim to make roles and responsibilities clearer and enhance the efficiency of standing committees. Despite underrepresentation from four districts on the SHHA board, the administration effectively manages the interests of all homeowners and property owners, though efforts are underway to recruit candidates from unrepresented districts. Plans are underway to revise the Restrictive Covenants across the community, which will require a 75% approval of property owners in each unit. The text also outlines the history of Sandia Heights, a community developed since 1965. The SHHA, founded in 1972, was formally incorporated as a non profit in New Mexico in 1975, seeking to promote the shared interests of the homeowners, property owners, and residents in the Sandia Heights Development. The association grew in tandem with the Tram Company and its subsidiaries and took on greater financial responsibility by 1985 to offer services like covenant monitoring and enforcement. Meanwhile, issues such as noise disturbances, remodeling endeavors, and community events within Sandia Heights have been addressed, and a neighborhood questionnaire is to be released. Lastly, residents can enjoy natural landscaping and participate in local clubs and events to enhance the community's livability. On a different note, the text concludes with seasonal gardening tips, including pruning schedules and planting recommendations for Albuquerque residents. April and May are perfect times for fertilizing, planting, and landscape improvement activities, and residents are encouraged to get involved.",

Directors should actively support SHHA's mission, including liaising with at least one major Board committee. A key objective is to support the quality of life within Sandia Heights and represent the interests of each district. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) is working on a project to review and streamline the 38 sets of covenants, in an effort to make them clearer, more enforceable, and user friendly. Information regarding covenant changes will be shared through several channels, and changes will be implemented upon agreement from a majority of property owners. Residents are encouraged to remind AAA Gas and WM Pumping about the 15mph speed limit due to incident reports. Between November and December 2002, the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) supervised 13 applications in line with relevant Restrictive Covenants. The SHHA board has made strides to improve the association’s management, primarily by revising by laws and reassessing covenants for better enforcement. This has led to disagreements over tree and view blockage, color and design resulting in frequent legal disputes and increased membership fees. Contributions have been made to Cedar Hill Park sans proper member consent eliciting dissatisfaction. Alternatively, the parks committee seeks public input on the park's design. News is periodically shared via community mediums like The Grit and the Residents Guide. Events such as a Wine Tasting Event and a series on Islam have been scheduled, as well as the announcement of the passing of a former member, William L. Stabler. Ads for various services like computer assistance and babysitting are listed. Juniper Hill Road residents plead for better adherence to speed limits. Gardening advice includes undertaking specific tasks at different times in February and March. Pesticides are discussed and contact details for babysitting, house sitting, and tutoring services are provided.

To achieve this, SHHA and the ACC (Architectural Control Committee) encourage homeowners to align their landscaping plans with covenant limitations. The SHHA continuously updates its member directory and handles arising issues like obstructive trees through the Covenant Support Committee (CSC). They encourage amicable resolutions between neighbors when conflicts arise, especially concerning shared views. The Traffic and Safety Committee advocates for safer roads with initiatives such as speed humps, made possible by resident support. Financially, Sandia Heights maintains assets of $88,324.12 as of October 31, 2002, alongside liabilities including an open space reserve, a legal reserve, and outstanding legal bills. SHHA also oversees community activities, including the development of a discount program and planning for an annual wine tasting event. In response to certain objections regarding the increase in monthly dues from $5 to $8, the Board is improving communication strategies to keep residents well informed. Projects such as the Cedar Hill Park have been questioned, but are defended by highlighting the changing community demographics. Trespassing on private lands for forest access exerts strain on the property owners, however, ongoing dialogue continues to establish safer walking trails. Coping with critical comments, the Grit journal maintains an unbiased approach, refraining from printing slanderous or false statements. Ensuring covenant adherence has legal implications and costs, but attempts at out of court settlements prevail to keep the expenses minimal. In other matters, homeowners are encouraged to test their homes for radon levels due to the potential health hazards it poses. Lastly, the water supply in Sandia heights is efficiently handled by Sandia Heights Services with the daily water usage within every household below the average for Albuquerque and Santa Fe cities. Community activities include the Wildflower Club meetings, the search for unit coordinators, and acknowledgment of the new SHHA membership monthly fee of $8.",

This was to be discussed in an upcoming Board of Directors meeting. To counter the drought and fire risk, Bernalillo County officials are in the process of developing Cedar Hill Park with a $19,000 contribution from SHHA’s Open Space Fund. The park’s construction is expected to begin soon. It was shared that the association spent $124,923.72 during 2001\/2002 on various needed expenses like communication, park maintenance, insurance, and legal fees. The SHHA has solicited new members to join its committee and has been working on updating its website and Residents Directory, urging all members to validate and amend any details if required. The website’s update is just one part of SHHA’s efforts to maintain open communication channels and compliance with existing restrictions. The Covenant Support Committee has been working on improving the often vague existing covenants to simplify compliance and decrease complaints concerning unruly trash management and rogue trees. The residents have been asked to research existing covenants to help develop model covenants in the coming year. For efficient waste management, suggestions like trashcans with rollers and lid locks, hiring neighborhood kids, or coming up with a barter system with neighbors were made. Chemical waste should be deposited at Rinchem Inc. The association faced some controversy regarding their use of dues for lawsuits against fellow residents, calling for more transparency. However, new proposed projects like \"Holiday Lights in the Heights\" and discussions for water rate increase, open spaces, and park development, are in full swing. In response to a couple of fires this summer, Sandia Peak Utility Company and Forest Service have provided firefighting capabilities with helicopters and a refuge site near Sandia Peak Utility offices. The SHHA and the Architectural Control Committee have been enforcing the covenants, drafted by different developers over time, creating clear standards and pursuing legal action where necessary. However, financial support is needed for legal litigation, along with a move to standardize covenants across all of Sandia Heights has been proposed. To enhance the value of being an SHHA member, contractor evaluations, community representation, community events, and a resident's directory, along with other services, have been offered. The SHHA appealed to the public for any feedback or suggestions regarding their services for improvement. Lastly, an effort to increase awareness about the correct trash disposal methods and timings was made, especially since strict compliance enhances the community's appeal. +1",

        "content": "During their meeting on February 13, 2002, the SHHA Board of Directors decided to adopt a neutral stance on the Pueblo of Sandia Boundary Dispute. This marked a shift from their earlier position, as they had previously financially supported a group against the agreed settlement between the Pueblo of Sandia, the United States, and the Tram Company. The Board now advocates for elected officials to pursue a satisfactory resolution and to avoid directing this dispute back to court. While the complexity of the dispute roots back to the Spanish domination era, SHHA had shown opposition in the past by supporting groups against the settlement and publishing articles suggesting their disapproval of it. To avoid further misunderstanding, a timeline of events was created for a clearer historical insight into the situation. The decision to pass the resolution is to express neutrality and promote a swift resolution to prevent any future legal issues.",

Further, the SHHA’s accomplishments and benefits along with the covenants that govern the residents of different subdivisions were discussed. The newsletter highlighted residential concerns like trash disposal, unwanted items and their impact on property enjoyment, and need for systemic addressal of these topics. Traffic safety with expected development of a park was a chief concern and speeding was flagged as a potentially hazardous issue. An appeal was made for feedback from members and the need for community involvement, and a proposed email notification system for security issues was discussed. The newsletter also featured advertisements for Brazos Lodge and Rentals, Computer courses for adults, outdoor pottery sales, Church of the Good Shepherd, and the principles of the Bien Mur Indian Market Center.

Camptell further suggested the draft should be defeated in the December voting. Sandia Heights Residents, who contribute significantly in sales tax to Albuquerque without influence on the allocation or representation in determining local police leadership, could potentially benefit from city county government unification. Operational efforts by the homeowners association, including a focus on traffic safety, excessive speeding as per a county study, and a new complaint handling procedure accepting only signed written complaints from August 27th onward, attempt to address concerns in the community. Other initiatives include work on vegetation maintenance, utilization of a $20,000 Open Space reserve, and actions to tackle wildlife concerns. Residents are also receiving advice and guidelines to maintain safety and environmental balance, encouraging trash security against animals, proper yard maintenance, and secure home openings. In an effort to promote community engagement, the association's newsletter, The Grit, is open to suggestions and comments, with new SHIA members encouraged to offer feedback or even contribute by writing. Possible activities for attracting members include a craft fair, a film show, and an antique fair. Considering potential tram discounts and rewards for vandalism information are also in progress.

The SHHA plans to lower association dues allocation, seek alternative funding sources and implement cost saving strategies. Sampling tests for the New Mexico Health and Environment Department confirmed that Sandia Height wells and groundwater are free from unregulated contaminants. Residents are urged to respect each other's privacy to prevent trespassing and vandalism. The Architectural Review Committee has seen a surge in business, reminding residents of the 30 day review period for renovation projects. Many residents have reported stucco related house damages, to which STO offers specialized repair materials, water proofers, and elastomeric acrylic finishes as solutions. The annual Holiday Craft Bazaar is set to take place on Sunday, October 15, featuring local artists from Sandia Heights or North Albuquerque Acres. SHHA is dealing with several home issues such as deteriorating walls and exterior aesthetics. Two new subdivisions are under the Sandia Heights Master Plan with mandatory membership policies for residents. The association plans to impose stricter restrictions to avoid covenant violations and reduce high legal costs. They also offer mediation services for non covenant related disputes. To improve cost controls and reporting, SHHA has started to budget by “cost centers”. This step allows board members to monitor spending and effectively allocate resources. The Government Liaison Committee successfully mitigated the impact of the Tramway Blvd expansion and local area development. They were able to achieve elevation redesigns, modified construction, and better drainage systems. Parking restrictions were also enforced on narrow streets to ensure public safety. The committee closely monitors ongoing developments including the new High Desert area and works with local authorities on potential funding proposals and landscape plans. The SHHA Board of Directors handled a surge of architectural submissions due to lower interest rates, reviewing plans for new homes and additions. Sandia Peak Tram Co. showed interest in handing over architectural reviews for their Unit 20 to SHHA.

These include the controversial decision of Bernalillo County to keep Eagle Ridge Lane open, resulting in increased traffic, potential late night unauthorized access, suspected vehicle racing, and a rise in crime rates. The move conflicts with SHHA's initial hiatus plan following Tramway Blvd's construction in 1991. However, according to County Public Works Director, Mr. Jha Ramsey, the road is essential for emergency access and meeting specific neighborhood requirements. Other issues involve local development. One case involves a new residential subdivision conditionally approved by the county's Planning Commission, which developer Don Morgan aims to appeal two of the conditions set. In another case, developer Vern Hagen proposed a new subdivision with 32 building units on a seven acre tract. While the unit density was accepted, concerns arose about transitioning from current half acre lots to smaller ones. In terms of community activities and initiatives, resident Max Sanches proposed a communal initiative for the Tramway Landscape Project, aimed at revamping the community area through engagement. SHHA also heads a recycling initiative inviting citizen volunteers. Among other matters is the neighborhood's annual meeting and Spring Fling Picnic, with board elections also planned. This event also accommodates a range of local businesses showcasing their services. Committees within SHHA are keen on preserving the aesthetics of the Sandia Heights' architectural design, with significant emphasis on screening equipment to blend with existing housing components. Approved plants for landscaping include various sages, with the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club providing resources for local gardeners. Emergent community needs consist of the Homeowners Referral Program, providing community members with access to professional services. However, specific areas still need referrals, with residents encouraged to recommend experienced professionals. Crime prevention and neighborhood support, particularly around Simms Park Road and Unit 18 due to the gate closure, have sparked concerns about safety and accessible emergency routes. Lastly, SHHA has expressed interest in introducing new categories for the best decorated subdivision in their annual events.",

        "content": "Significant developments occurred revolving around a water company over the past month, generating concerns beyond rate issues. The legal discovery process spurred the involvement of many interested parties such as the President's Message, Ski Company, Public Service Commission. These concerns weren't effectively addressed by the existing rate case or the Commission and despite significant water rate increase wins, the Utility Company has maintained silence on these issues. The SHHA, dedicated to safeguarding consumer interests, plans to appeal the rate case to the courts. The company operates amidst escalating costs and potentially deteriorating services, with resistance from the Joint Venture and Utility Company resulting in expensive rate interventions. The SHHA has won appreciation for its strict oversight of rate increase requests and building regulation enforcement, despite accusations of overly assertive intervention. Concerns exist about the proprietary and transparency of business transactions in the complex leasing network between the Utility Company, Joint Venture, Tram Company, Ski Company, and Alvarado Realty. Inclusive in these concerns is a provision allowing the Joint Venture to exit leases on half a year's notice, possibly leaving the community without water and equipment. Service expansions, daily water loss for dust control, lease auditing, pumping policies, and hook up fee regulation are additional concerns needing attention. Despite these challenges, the Water Rate Intervention effort has yielded results such as heightened community awareness, improved financial reporting, and a substantial rate reduction for smaller water users. The text also discusses flora specific to the area and appeals for various community support initiatives, alongside mentioning an upcoming Holiday Bazaar. In conclusion, the SHHA continues its reform efforts amidst complex issues around water rights and services, calling upon the community's support for further action.",

This includes: Completion of the water intervention program Improvements to infrastructure, such as roads and parks Amplifying security and safety measures Strengthening covenant and architectural control programs Enhancement of existing services and strategic planning The Board invites members' input and a directory naming SHHA representatives is forthcoming. An ongoing challenge is the proposed Stipulation from Sandia Peak Utility Company, which does not account for issues in the rate case scenario, such as perceived unfairness to residential users and concerns about concessions to commercial entities. A commitment to pursuing this intervention effort persists despite limited resources, and community involvement and financial support are encouraged. The local flora, inclusive of the penstemon, a resilient North American native, is highlighted. Concerns from County Public Works over road shoulder sanitation leads to residents being tasked to clear obstructions, which will be picked up by designated county personnel. Regarding community events, sign ups for a travel group's Navajo Lake camping trip and the imminent Holiday Bazaar are ongoing; cancellations are expectant in case of insufficient participation. Issues of roaming dogs leading to public nuisance and health hazards are raised by a local resident and calls for responsible pet ownership underscored. A community directory will be distributed in early July and article submission and advertising opportunities in THE GRIT, a community newsletter, are available. C. Andy Anderson is introduced as a new board member. His family’s academic and professional achievements, languages spoken, and community involvement are mentioned. The increasing number of fire and rescue calls in District 5 because of expanding development necessitate increased resources and encourages community volunteering and donations. A Heavy Duty Rescue Vehicle and diesel powered bumper will arrive shortly, and the reopening of a fire station will improve response times. A Boy Scout Troop formation and other community services, such as pet sitting and mail collection, are noted with contact numbers for interest.

        "content": "In 1988, the Sandia Heights Utility Corporation proposed a water rate increase which was met with strong opposition by homeowners at a home association meeting, citing a number of reasons for their resistance. The SHHA took immediate action, with homeowners calling for funds allocation in order to intervene professionally. Sandia Peak Utility Company justified the increase with claims of operating at a loss and needing an additional $134,266 in revenue for effective operation. Key points of the situation include: Despite similarities in delivery costs, the proposed increase meant water bills in Sandia would be 198% higher than in Albuquerque based on average water usage of 8229 gallons. A committee was formed by the SHHA to address the issue, requiring more funds for a successful intervention in audits, rate adjustment, and service quality maintenance. To support this, a $30 voluntary contribution from each member or homeowner was requested, to be placed in a legal and accounting escrow to back the intervention. If there is any leftover after all SHHA funded interventions, it will be refunded. The urgency comes from the potential communal bill increase of at least $134,266 annually due to the proposed rate increase. Contributions can be sent to Sandia Heights Homeowners Association in Albuquerque, with any questions directed to either the Intervention Committee or the SHHA Board. Members are also encouraged to garner support within their local community.",

The board highlights the success of past events, like the Wine Tasting Party, and encourages such communal interactions, especially during holiday seasons. However, the distribution of services is under scrutiny, with a recent survey showing uneven interest in potential amenities across the region. Gas availability at affordable prices is a high priority, particularly in units 11, 9, and 8. The contact for more information on the survey is Jim Randall. Low response rates of 211 out of 1,085 mailings raised concerns, prompting calls for further support to the local fire department, B.C.F.D. districts. Sandia Heights homeowners are urged to maintain cleanliness, safety, and take pride in the community. The board plans to implement long term area improvements and facilitate future communal events.

        "content": "In 1986, SHHA embarked on new projects like a dues collection plan and initiated a survey to help decision making processes. Key actions included rescheduling the repainting of the Circle K. building, installing reflectors on Tramway Blvd, replacing one sided street signs, managing increased road usage, monitoring covenant adherence (particularly for solar installations), and welcoming Sara Warford to the hospitality department. The survey revealed interests in jogging, biking, natural gas introduction, activity groups, more snow plowing, adding GRIT editions, expanding the triathlon, home decoration contests, and the addition of Outpost arena. Future initiatives are dependent on interest and funding, with homeowners' dues expected to cover over 55% of the budget and additional funds being sought by membership committee drives. Improvements are also in the pipeline for parks and community activities, such as creation of a volleyball court. However, certain issues like road signage, stray animals, solicitation, road and pool repairs, and landscaping are handled by the county and Alvarado Realty. Ongoing lobbying efforts for street light improvements and road widening are encouraged, and residents can also post \"no soliciting\" signs. New neighbor integration is facilitated by newcomer coffees and the guard services are managed by Alvarado Realty. Covenant enforcement is being reinforced as per the President's Report and committed volunteers Carolyn Hudson, Lynne Uehnfiels, and Jon Freeman serve as essential community contacts. Full SHHA membership, noted by an asterisk next to the member's name, can be attained with a yearly $30 fee offering diverse benefits. Community efforts are underway to reduce winter bird collisions and dead birds can be donated to the Museum of Southwestern biology at UNM. Residents are also reminded to make their house numbers clearly visible for emergency services, ideally through purchasing reflective 4 6 inch letters. Informational meetings are held every second Wednesday of the month at the Fire Station, with all residents encouraged to attend.",

Five residents were elected to a three year term on the Board of Directors: Lynne Behnfield, Jerry Boucher, Judy Harris, Bill Jackson, and Don McBride. The neighborhood \"Tiny Triathalon\" was deemed successful. The association commenced its new fiscal year on July 1, with dues due for community activities. Concerns were raised over nine major fires in the district, mostly caused by illegal fireworks, with the most significant one being the Juniper Hill fire. In response to this, the association aims to enforce a fireworks ban within the community to prevent endangering lives and property. The community was asked to respect restrictions in place and was reminded about the upcoming events. The association has petitioned the Bernalillo County government to address traffic and safety issues on Tramway Boulevard. Requests include street light installations, left hand turn lanes at major intersections, and plans to make the boulevard a four lane thoroughfare. Community support is sought for these improvements. Community residents Matthew Neal and Tom Reed offer their services for odd jobs and marine examinations, respectively. Mothers in the community are encouraged to exchange babysitting services, with Marie Rundle as the point of contact. A recipe for 'Aunt Linda's Praline Cookies' has been shared, and the Prince of Peace Catholic Community invites all to their Sunday Mass.

An attached financial report provides details for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1984. Updated bylaws now feature two major amendments: the introduction of active\/contributing and inactive membership categories, with only active members holding voting rights, and the expansion of the Board of Directors from seven to fifteen members. This amplifies the Sandia Heights area representation and activity. Membership contributions for the 1984\/1985 term will commence from July 1, 1984. Active members paying the thirty dollars membership fee will gain voting rights and benefits including a tram area parking permit and a Sandia Heights resident directory. Non paying members, while devoid of decision making rights, still contribute to community maintenance costs. On November 9th at 16:00, Rab Freeman or Muffy will host an event at 131 Big Horn Ridge Court. All neighbors are invited and asked to confirm their attendance at 258 2977. Future gatherings will be announced in the neighborhood newsletter. A neighborhood mothers' group seeks support to enhance the children's play area; their initiative will be detailed in the October newsletter along with a questionnaire to solicit resident feedback.

The nominated list for Board of Director vacancies was enclosed. The proposed amendments to the Articles of Incorporation include modifying the Association's purpose with limitations related to the Corporation's net earnings. The Bylaws propose new membership system, expanding the board, and a protocol for replacing board members. To dissent, members should return the proxy form, but it's unnecessary if they agree. The mailing details suggest this is a mass mailing dispatched from 54e Black Bear Rd, Albuquerque, NM 87122 using a bulk rate for U.S. postage.

Traffic issues on Tramway Boulevard have been discussed, along with the purpose of the SHA and the identification of new SHHA Committee Chairs. Unregistered members are encouraged to register by April 24th to vote in the June 5th Primary. Changes in the SHHA by laws have been proposed: Expansion of the Board of Directors from seven to between fourteen and sixteen members. Voting rights restricted to dues paying members. Inactive board members to leave automatically. Further legitimization of the non profit status of SHHA. A disputed land swap between the Tram Company, the Forest Service, and the City was talked about: The trade involves the 160 acre La Cueva land for the 325 350 acre Rounds Estate for developing a suitable area. Concerns raised include potential damage to La Cueva's natural resources and a conflict of interests. Regarding traffic on Tramway Boulevard: The problem is escalating due to residential and commercial developments, making current conditions hazardous. The need for road extension presents a future challenge. SHHA has urged members to: Increase their participation and contribute dues to help with neighborhood improvements, covenant enforcement, and community cohesion. Have more financial support to safeguard homeowners' interests and improve the living environment. The SHHA spends a significant proportion of the budget on maintenance tasks, including snow and ice removal and playground upkeep. Long range planning committee: Led by Bill Jackson, focusses on Tramway Boulevard's development. The committee frequently reports on public meetings, city transportation gatherings, and county planning commission sessions. In community matters: Homeowners are reminded to adhere to water pressure regulations. Sports programs, like the Sandia Heights Swim Team, are organized for Four Seasons members. A caretaker is needed for a three month old baby and a teenager seeks employment in odd jobs. Lastly, Wendland Beezhold continues to serve as the Board President and details of a foreign language announcement relating to board activities remain unclear due to language barriers.",

        "content": "In 1983, the Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association conducted a survey to gauge community attitudes towards the liquor license application of the County Line Restaurant. The initiative, led by Vice President Randall Williams, saw responses from 37% of the 692 residences, with 67% opposing the establishment and citing increased traffic hazards as a primary concern. Consequently, the Board decided to actively oppose the application, doubting the consistency between the proposed 140 seat lounge and the purported \"family restaurant\" image. The Homeowners' Board is also tightening control over covenant violations and homeowner information services, which were previously managed by the Tram Company. To this end, they are currently recruiting for an Executive Vice President and are tackling restriction violations such as unscreened boats, unauthorized building structures, and unscreened antenna discs. The board also rejected the Tram Company's proposed fee increases for various services and stressed the need for additional funds for neighborhood maintenance. Homeowners were reminded of restrictions, the requirement to pay dues, and the illegality of animal cruelty. The Association has planned numerous upcoming events and activities including the Annual Sandia Heights Holiday Fair. Babysitting services are available from local persons Camille at 293 7816 and Lisa at 294 0122. All information is provided with transparency and in good faith by the Association's president, Wendland Beezhold.",

The consensus of the residents was that a bar or restaurant at that location could harm their safety and this argument was successfully presented by attorney Mr. McCullough. A reminder that all homeowners in Sandia Heights are voting members of the Association, even if not all pay voluntary dues, thus their presence can greatly shape the community. Hence, it is recommended that residents join the upcoming meeting of the Association on Saturday, February 26, 1983, at the Firehouse to contribute to discussions about Sandia Heights' future.",

Additionally, the Sandia Peak Tram Company has planned zoning of land for residential use as per the 1976 Master Plan. Two areas west of Tramway Boulevard are being zoned for townhouses and garden homes, while a third at the southeast corner of Sandia Heights is designated for residential lots, each about 3\/4 acre in size, bearing restrictions similar to other Sandia Heights lots. The association continues monitoring for breaches of restriction covenants, and the area's guard service has extended weekend shifts due to recent incidents of vandalism.

Residents were also asked to financially support the community's main security, the guard service, which operates 70 72 hours a week. Letters received by the GRIT showed residents recently voiced concerns about problems caused by stray dogs and road safety due to the hilly and low visibility nature of the roads. Additionally, future local events and services were announced, including a ski trip, a need for Scrabble players, and a sale of items. Babysitters were reminded to send in their details and there was a call for children interested in summer jobs. Home safety reminders were also issued. The self contained Sandia Heights community, housing around 650 residences and governed by Fire District #5, is proud of its water service, waste disposal system, and roads, developed primarily by community’s developers: Alvarado Realty Company, Sandia Peak Tram Company, and Sandia Peak Ski Company. Not only do these companies fund improvements to community facilities, but they also facilitate recreational facilities, like the Four Seasons Club with swimming and tennis, horse stables, and the Sandia Peak Tramway for outdoor activities. The community also provides direct access to two restaurants, The Firehouse and High Finance.",

        "content": "In 1979, the Sandia Heights Security Patrol, backed by substantial resident support, extended its operational hours to roughly 65 hours per week, focusing primarily on weekend nights. Continued contributions from residents were encouraged to augment and ameliorate service. For enhanced child safety, motorized traffic was prohibited from the ballfield\/playground area, and residents were asked to advocate for maintenance priorities for Trasway Blvd. with county officials. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association scheduled an annual meeting on May 12, 1979, with discussions on topics like annual solicitations for contributions and playground issues, and voting for filling two board seats. The residents were informed about an upcoming annual cleanup day and requested for voluntary dues to help install a grass and watering system in the playground. The Sandia Heights Swim team announced the commencement of its season the following month under new coach Livy Parsons, a highly qualified professional. Residents were advised to observe caution while driving in the vicinity to avoid accidents involving children.",
