  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                      October 2007    President’s Corner    How Do I……?       Ever wonder just how you get something done by your association?  Let’s say you want  to put up a garage—who do you call?  What happens next? What do I need to submit?   Maybe a new neighbor moved in and has a lot of moving boxes stacked out front for weeks  on end—who do you call?  Chamisa too high at the corner—safety hazard?  Who do you  call?  There is a water leak in the street—who do you call?  Your homeowners association  has made this real easy, just call the office at 797-7793 or if that fails give me a call at 301- 4508.  We will take it from there—that is about as easy as you can get.  In some cases we  may have you fill out paperwork for the Architectural Control Committee—there is always a  catch.  But in most cases we will just initiate the necessary actions or refer you to the proper  business, such as Sandia Heights Services for water questions.  In any event, you will get a  response and an explanation.               Our latest example is the rezoning for an office building in unit 16.  The owner had asked  to rezone from A-1 to O-1 and this presented a possible problem in the future, as O-1 allows  a very broad scope of possible businesses.  We met with SHHA legal advisors, had a town  hall meeting and discussed with the property owner—who by the way attended the town hall  meeting with his staff.  As a result, the owner asked for a deferral and is in the process of  requesting a special use permit under the existing A-1 zoning, which will allow the office  that they plan on building, but does not allow for the many uses that would have been open  under O-1.  We think we have the problem solved to the satisfaction of all involved.         As I see the priorities for the SHHA, we are here to maintain our property values and  unique surroundings by applying the covenants that are an integral part of our property  deeds.  We do this by reviewing new construction, modifications and landscaping, as well as  enforcing the other covenant restrictions.  We also act as your voice on matters of road  safety, parks and land use in the community.  Of course we have a myriad of other functions  but we all volunteer to keep our community the unique and enjoyable place that we all love  to come home to after a day or week or month away.  I would encourage you to join us in  helping maintain this unique area, please give me a call if you have 3-5 hours a month to  offer YOUR association.  It’s the only way we are able to support the many functions that  keep our community an enjoyable and safe area.

Faced with urban expansion, the County undertook an initiative a few years ago to levy a special tax to  create an open space fund. Its purpose is to permit the acquisition of property for open space before such  land becomes swallowed up in urban development.    As a neighborhood, Sandia Heights is pretty much developed. The only undeveloped property of  significant size that is left is this 10.3 acre parcel. Our intent would be to work with the County to  preserve this land for recreational and environmental purposes and as a habitat for wildlife.     The immediate challenge is to find the funding for the acquisition of this property. At its September 12  meeting, the Board voted unanimously to support and endorse this initiative. George Connor, until  recently Chair of the County’s Open Space Advisory Committee and a former member of SHHA’s  Board, has been appointed to head up this effort.    The benefits to Sandia Heights residents of preserving this land as open space are:  -  walking trails  -  enhanced pedestrian safety on Tramway Lane  -  corridors and habitat for wildlife  -  grand view of Sandia Mountains for all passing by   -  preservation of the last free flowing natural arroyos in NE area  -  saving undeveloped 10.3 acres for future generations  The GRIT, October 2007                                                                                                                      Page 3  STATUS OF RUBBERIZED  ASPHALT ON TRAMWAY    The State Engineer  has informed us  that in the  preparation phase  of the resurfacing  they couldn’t  continue with the  resurfacing process  because the  condition of the  road was much  worse than  anticipated. They  are now looking for additional funds to remill the  road before resurfacing it. The State still plans on  resurfacing it with a rubberized asphalt but cannot  say when it can be done.       BYLAWS COMMITTEE ~ Marsha Thole,  Chair     Your committee is faithfully moving forward with  drafting revision bylaw articles. We are going to be  discussing the terms of office for the board officers  as well as board members (directors) at our October  meeting. We strive to get volunteers from the  different units so that we have a wide variety of  perspectives on issues your Board tackles every  month. Some units have never been represented on  the board; some boards have never had a  representative from the units on the west side of  Tramway. We would like to avoid these situations.     Directors are elected to a 3-year term, but we seem  to lose people before their term is up. What is your  take on the term limits for board members? Are  they too long? Is there a better way to elect board  members? If you have hesitated to volunteer to be a  board member, what were your reasons? Has a  different arrangement proved to be successful in  other associations to which you have belonged?  Your input is important to us. If you have an  opinion on this, please call the office or email the  office (put "bylaws input" in the subject line) by  October 8. You can leave the information  anonymously. Whether you sign your name makes  no difference--it won't be used. We just need your  comments.        Sandia Heights Road Maintenance ~ Ed  Whitten    Representatives of SHHA met with the Road  Maintenance Engineer, Public Works Division, to  discuss the detail planning for the 2007 Sponsored  Paving Projects in Sandia Heights. The 2007  Legislative Appropriations for Sandia Heights were  $575,000, thanks to SHHA's efforts and the support  of our State representatives Bill Rehm and Kathy  McCoy.      The county is following our 5 year plan of priorities  as best as they can. All of our "Year One" roads (13  road segments) have been completed (except Big  Horn Ridge Place and Big Horn Ridge Court, due to  a gas line issue which is being worked). In addition,  they have completed four "Bulbs" (small cul-de- sacs) of our out-year priorities.    The 2007 Expenditure Projects to be completed in  2008 have fewer segments than last year but are  much longer. They include:  Live Oak Rd, Juniper  Hill Rd (North and South), Juniper Hill Loop,  Tramway Circle and Eagle Ridge Drive. We  requested that an effort to coordinate the road  maintenance schedule with Sandia Services refuse  pick-up be considered. We also requested that a  work order be issued to repair some of the curb  damage done last winter.    This year’s appropriation has not yet been  contracted over to the County, so it will be a while  before any further road work begins. We will  publish any tentative schedules when we learn of  them.   We learned that school bus routes have priority on  maintenance (which we support). If you know of  specific road maintenance that is urgent, please let  us know.     SHHA also plans to work with the State Highway  Department on requesting "median landscaping" on  Tramway and Paseo.

A Note from the Sandia Heights Services Manager  The Security Patrol would like to remind everyone that school has  started back now, so please be aware of your speed throughout the  subdivisions. There are many school bus stops with children at or  near them in the mornings and afternoons.    Also as a reminder, the sanitation crew cannot take paints,  flammables or old tires and batteries, as these are considered  hazardous waste by the landfill.     Please comply with the County ordinance and limit your cans, bags  and barrels to 40lbs. County ordinance also states that all refuse  must be at the roadside no later than 7:00 AM of the day of  collection and no earlier than 5:00 PM of the day prior to collection.

GARDEN NEWS from Bob Francis, resident    Here come the Asters       In our neck of the arroyos, Aster plants are starting to bloom. Thanks to the nice  summer rains and some cooling weather, we are starting to see several wild flowers  blooming. Also showing their colors are the Threadleaf Groundsel. Threadleaf   Groundsel looks like a Chamisa when they are young and now their yellow flowers are  coming. The yellow flower almost looks like a daisy.       Starting to phase out now are the Purple Verbenas and the Blazing Star. We still  have some Cleome (white and pink) flower. The Brickle Bush continues its invasion  into Sandia Heights. I have spotted numerous Brickle Bush in the area. Brickle Bush is now showing up  in the Quail Run area, (Unit 20).       Now is the time to stop the Brickle Bush from spreading. Cut it down now before it goes to seed. If  you are having problems with Brickle Bush, or can’t identify the plant, call the SHHA office and I will  come out to take a look at your property.       In my next article I am going to discuss some of the secret gardens I have found in Sandia Heights.       Finally, here is a teaser for you: The Apache Plume has two things going for it. In fact, it is so unique  that its uniqueness is included in its real name. Next time I will give you the clue.
