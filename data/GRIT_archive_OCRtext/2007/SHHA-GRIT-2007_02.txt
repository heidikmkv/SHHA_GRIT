        President’sMessage:  SHHA Needs You  We are always in need of volunteer help for our community, our various committees and the  SHHA administrative activities. If you can help and want to serve your community, please step  forward. As we work on various projects and issues within Sandia Heights, we are interested in  hearing from our members. Your comments and ideas will help us improve our community. Contact  me via the office or e-mail at shha@sandiahomeowners.org.  Traffic Survey  The Traffic, Safety & Environment Committee has put together a survey, included in this GRIT.  We would appreciate your taking time to answer the questions, making your comments and  returning it to the office by March 1. It takes about 3 minutes to complete.   Proposed Unified Covenants  In December a special board meeting was held to discuss the Proposed Unified Covenants. The  majority of the board determined that more homeowner input is needed as well as preparing the  presentation for the community consideration and vote. It has come to our attention that some  people think that the proposed unified covenants have been passed. No vote has yet been taken. The  proposed unified covenants have not passed. Each unit is still governed by its own set of covenants.  If you have questions regarding your covenants refer to the covenants, for your unit which can be  found on our website at www.sandiahomeowners.org.     Zoning Request Change Delayed for Property at Tramway Blvd and Paseo Del Norte  --  SHHA Town Hall Meeting on Monday, Feb. 5, Church of the Good Shepherd  --  Check www.sandiahomeowners.org in late January for the hearing date.   --  Send email address for schedule change notification.  -- Write County Planning Commission with your opinion.      The County Planning Commission’s (CPC) hearing to consider the request to rezone the 10.4  acres at the intersection of Paseo Del Norte and Tramway Blvd was delayed for up to 60 days. It  can be heard at either the Feb 7 or March 7 meetings, unless delayed further at one of these  meetings. We won’t know until about Jan 18 whether it will be heard on Feb 7. Again, we need a  large turnout at the hearing. Please plan to attend.    Because this zoning request has been of such short notice, and over the holiday season of the  year, it has been difficult to notify the 100+ interested homeowners of any schedule changes.  To  facilitate this, SHHA has set up a quick notification email alert system. If you want to be notified of  schedule changes, send your email address to shha@sandiahomeowners.org and you will receive  prompt notification of schedule changes on the CPC agenda involving this request.  If you do not  have email access, please contact Don Wortman 858-0744 to be put on a phone list.   The hearing was delayed because only four out of a seven planning commissioners were present   Continued on page 2  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                          February 2006 The GRIT, February 2007    Page 2  Continued from front page  on Jan. 3, so the CPC Chair offered to delay any item on the agenda at the request of the  applicant. Mr. Bennett, the owner’s agent, requested a 30-day delay. The County suggested 60 days.  A motion was passed delaying this matter for up to 60 days.   We are concerned that an R2 zoning change would allow high density, and possibly multiple  story apartment buildings, on these 10.4 acres. R2 could allow structures in excess of 26 feet.  This  will block many homeowner views. As many of you know, the zoning request only specified the  change for “development of multi-purpose housing,” and lacked plans.  SHHA will hold a Town Hall Meeting on this request on Feb. 5 in the sanctuary of the Church  of the Good Shepherd at 7 PM. Mr. Bennett and Mr. Mhoon (property owner) will be invited to  make a presentation of their development plans. David Campbell, our attorney, is planning on  attending. Even if Mr. Bennett and Mr. Mhoon decide not to attend, this will be an important  meeting to further clarify SHHA’s position on this request.  It is very important that we, as residents of Sandia Heights, continue to express our opposition  to this rezoning request. If you have not done so, please send a letter to County Commissioner Tim  Cummins at 1 Civic Plaza, 10th Floor, Albuquerque, NM 87102. Send a copy to the County  Planning Commission, c/o Sanford Fish, Planning Director, at 111 Union Square SE, Suite 100,  Albuquerque, NM, 87102.   Please contact Don Wortman, Board Liaison for this matter, at 858-0744, if you have questions  or suggestions.

To do this we need the support  and help of the community in running your  organization. We are now beginning the  process for finding new volunteer directors  for 2007. Board members are elected for 3- year terms with elections at the Annual  Meeting in June. The 3-year commitment is  revocable if your personal circumstances  change; you may submit a resignation letter,  although we would like to have members  serve at least one year. What are the  qualifications for the job—just a love of this  wonderful neighborhood and a desire to  work with others to keep it vibrant. We need  representation on the board from all of the  units and we urge you to consider taking this  opportunity to become a board member. The  next few years will be an exciting  opportunity for you to help plan the future of  our neighborhood—your neighborhood.  Please review the beige pages of the 2006  Directory of Residents, which lists the duties  of the committees and other functions of the  board. If you are willing to serve as a board  member, we urge you to contact Sy Caudill  at 301-4508 or email: a1200c@netzero.com.  What will be your goal--to preserve the  Sandia Heights we all enjoy and love,  serving as a member of the board is a  rewarding opportunity and we hope you will  join us in this effort. The board could also  use more female members and parents with  young children, to help bring more diversity  to the needs of our community. We will  accept volunteers from all units, but we  would encourage homeowners in the  following units to volunteer as they are not  currently represented on the board: North: 2  and 3, South: 1 and 2, 5, 6, 7, 8C, 9, 10, 15,  16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27A, 27B or 27C,  28A & 28 B.

The GRIT, Feb 2007                                                                                                               Page 8           The holiday of Valentine's Day probably derives  its origins from the ancient Roman feast of  Lupercalia. In the early days of Rome, fierce  wolves roamed the woods nearby. The Romans  called upon one of their gods, Lupercus, to keep  the wolves away. A festival held in honor of  Lupercus was celebrated February 15th. One of  the customs of the young people was name- drawing. On the eve of the festival of Lupercalia  the names of Roman girls were written on slips of  paper and placed into jars. Each young man drew  a slip. The girl whose name was chosen was to be  his sweetheart for the year.     Legend has it that the holiday became  Valentine's Day after a priest named Valentine.  Valentine was a priest in Rome. The Emperor at  that time, Claudius II, ordered the Roman soldiers  NOT to marry or become engaged. Claudius  believed that as married men, his soldiers would  want to stay home with their families rather than  fight his wars. Valentine defied the Emperor's  decree and secretly married the young couples. He  was eventually arrested, imprisoned, and put to  death.      Valentine was beheaded on February 14th, the  eve of the Roman holiday Lupercalia. After his  death, Valentine was named a saint. As Rome  became more Christian, the priests moved the  spring holiday from the 15th of February to the  14th - Valentine's Day.   Home Safety Tips  Most accidents occur at home and many of  them are preventable, so it is important that  your home is as safe as possible. Here are  some helpful tips from the U.S. Consumer  Product Safety Commission on making your  home a safer place for everyone.    Telephone numbers for the Police, Fire  Department, and local Poison Control Center,  along with a neighbor's number, should be  readily available. Write the numbers in large  print and tape them to the phone, or place  them near the phone where they can be seen  easily.  Take extra precautions in storing and using  flammable liquids, such as gasoline, paint  thinners, etc. They produce invisible  explosive vapors that can ignite by a small  spark at considerable distances from the  flammable substance. Store outside the house.     Everyday substances as charcoal lighter, paint  thinner and remover, antifreeze and turpentine  may cause death if swallowed. These poisons  should have child-resistant caps, be stored in  the original containers with the original  labels, and be kept locked up out of sight and  reach of children.    Unvented heaters should be used with room  doors open or window slightly open to  provide ventilation. The correct fuel, as  recommended by the manufacturer, should  always be used. Vented heaters should have  proper venting, and the venting system should  be checked frequently. Improper venting is  the most frequent cause of carbon monoxide  poisoning, and older consumers are at special  risk.    If you don't have a step stool, consider buying  one. Choose one with a handrail that you can  hold onto while standing on the top step.  Before climbing on any step stool, make sure  it is fully opened and stable. Tighten screws  and braces on the step stool. Discard step  stools with broken parts.    For all stairways, check lighting, handrails,  and the condition of the steps and coverings.  Stairs should be lighted so that each step,  particularly the step edges, can be clearly seen  while going up and down stairs. Consider  refinishing or replacing worn treads, or  replacing worn carpeting. Worn or torn  coverings or nails sticking out from coverings  could snag your foot or cause you to trip. The  lighting should not produce glare or shadows  along the stairway. You should be able to turn  on the lights before you use the stairway from  either end. If no other light is available, keep  an operating flashlight in a convenient  location at the top and bottom of the stairs.    The GRIT, February 2007                                                                                                          Page 11  Community Event Bulletin Board:  (Not all of these groups are sponsored by SHHA but the information is provided to keep residents informed)    Sandia Cork & Fork Update: The Sandia Heights Cork and Fork dining activity is off to a good  start in its second season.

Recycling Committee member Deb Benton and  Bernalillo County Solid Waste Department employee Gib  Wade help Ray Tuegel fill the roll-off with recyclables.    Neither snow nor cold nor wind….  Despite less than ideal conditions, Sandia Heights residents  rallied to help do their part for the environment at the Recycle  Drop-Off event on January 6th.  Nearly 2 dozen families  pitched in their Holiday recyclables at the second drop-off  event that has been sponsored by the SHHA.    A committee of your fellow Sandia Heights residents has been  working diligently for the past six months on raising the  awareness of recycling in the community. We are working on bringing curbside recycling to our  community in the future.  However, before we can make curbside a reality, we need to show that the  community supports recycling at these drop-off events.      Here are the details of the next drop-off day:  When:  Saturday, March 24, 2007                Time:  9am – 12pm      Where:  Sandia Heights Services Office on Tramway Road (East on Tramway at the 3-way stop -- half- way up to the base of the Tram on the right -- look for signs!)  What:  Plastics #1 & #2, Newspaper, Junk Mail, Cardboard, Paper, Aluminum, Steel (Sorry, NO glass)  The impact of recycling is immense.  If everyone in the U.S. would recycle one aluminum can per day, we  would save the energy equivalent of 2.5 billion gallons of gasoline per year.  Please do your part!
