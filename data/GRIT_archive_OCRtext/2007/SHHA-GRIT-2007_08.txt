  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                     August 2007        Cell Phone Tower Update   T-Mobile has withdrawn its request for a cell tower at Futures for Children. At the County  Commissioner's Meeting on June 26, 2007 the commissioners formally accepted T-Mobile's  withdrawal of their appeal of the disapproval by the County Planning Commission. T-Mobile advised  that they may reapply at some later date with a revised design and location. For now, the issue is off  the table.    Thank you to all the residents and SHHA board members who attended many meetings and  discussions to voice their concerns in opposition of the proposed Cell Tower. We realize that many  people would like to see improved cell phone coverage in the area and we are optimistic that this can  be accomplished without becoming an undesirable view issue.      900 Tramway Rezoning Project – One Year Deferral for Rezoning   At its July 11 meeting, the County Planning Commission (CPC) granted a one-year deferral on  the requested zone change of the 10.3 acres at 900 Tramway Lane. County staff recommended a 6- month deferral; however, a representative of Rick Bennett Architects, the firm that represents the  owner, suggested a year. The CPC agreed and stated that they can return earlier than a year if they get  their planning accomplished.     In agreeing to this deferral, SHHA’s president made it clear to the CPC that this deferral assumes  they are no longer pursuing their original R-2 request, but will be pursuing a Special Use Permit  (SUP) for the current zoning. The chair of the CPC, in a dialog with the representative of Rick  Bennett Architects, confirmed that the owner would be submitting a request for a SUP.  The chair  further agreed with the SHHA position that SHHA would have an opportunity to review the site  development plans before the issue is again brought before the CPC.    MAIL THEFT WARNING:   In recent months there have been several mailbox thefts. On the night  of June 15, 3 mailboxes were broken into - these units were located  on the east side of Raintree Dr NE.    In June mailboxes in the Live Oak area were broken into and the  thieves gained access to a resident’s bank account. PLEASE be  advised that it is much safer to take your mail to a collection box or  the Post Office, or hand it to your mail carrier.

They consist of rabbits of all ages, including young ones. The rabbits were not killed by a  dog or coyote, and do not show signs of violence. Although I am not an expert on these matters, I  suspect that the rabbits may be inadvertent victims of rat poison. I know that some Sandia Heights  residents put out poisoned bait for rats, and this may be consumed by rabbits as well. So, if you are  on the warpath against rats, you might consider all the options before using poisoned bait.     Consultation with a toxicologist or the county Animal Control experts would also be recommended  before introducing poison into the ecosystem. Also, the coyote population appears to be down as a  result of the dwindling rabbit population.    Hayward H.

BYLAWS COMMITTEE  UPDATE  Marsha Thole     Your Bylaws Committee has been hard at  work on the revision of the SHHA bylaws.  While our bylaws are not exactly on the Top  10 Summer Reading List (or any list for that  matter!), you are welcome to review them and  submit your proposed changes to the Bylaws  Committee. If you came from an association  where you had very good bylaws, perhaps you  could tell us what was working well so that we  are sure to incorporate that into ours. On the  other hand, if your experience with bylaws has  been a nightmare, we could use your input as  well so that we know what needs to be  clarified or clearly spelled out. In either case,  your comments are welcome. Just turn them in  to the office.       How to feed birds, not bears     ⇒ Tip One:  Hang your seed feeders and  hummingbird feeders 10 feet up on a  sturdy metal line suspended on poles or  tree branches. Position your feeders 10  feet from each end of the poles/limbs.  Stop feeding for a time if seed is  accumulating on the ground.  ⇒ Tip Two:  If you have high eaves or  second story eaves, you can hang  feeders from them.  ⇒ Tip Three:  Feed small amounts of seed  that will last only several hours in the  morning. This will work only if you’ve  had no bear visitors. If a bear is in your  feeders, you will need to stop feeding  for a time and go to tip one, two or four.  ⇒ Tip Four:  Stop feeding birds from July  1 thru Oct. 1. Last summer many people  called New Mexico Department of  Game and Fish to complain or ask for  trapping of bears for being in their bird  feeders and were told to stop feeding  birds during these recommended dates.    Bear Watch (BW) believes  that if birdfeeders are hung  and maintained properly,  you can enjoy your feathered  friends and, in the process,  help protect our dwindling  bear population.    For more information on how to co-exist with  bears, please feel free to call BW Founder Jan  Hayes at 281-9282.

SOSH - SINGLES OF SANDIA HEIGHTS  It is never too late to join the social club of Sandia Heights, almost makes you think of women in bustle skirts,  white lace gloves, and parasols, and men in tails and top hats, doesn't it?! No, not really, after all, it is 2007. If  your calendar is blank, then you do have a problem, but not to worry. We all have our problems, though,  and SOSH is deciding which event to attend. Upcoming events are: The Great Southwestern Antique Show  (brunch and hoofing it around the Convention Center), 'A Charming Tea' at Another Place 'N' Time in Tijeras (a  lot of drinking--tea), and the CCR concert at the State Fair (a lot of grooving with the music and wishing we were  back in the '60s), and movie day, among other activities. Men and women are welcome. Our group is growing,  and we have 28 to date, ranging in age from the 40s to the 80s--single, divorced, widowed, geographically  separated from spouse. SOSH is not Match.com--just a nice bunch of folks who like to socialize. If you are  interested in joining us (no dues, no meetings--yes, we are for real!), give Marsha Thole a call (856-3352). Get out  of your rut and make a call--it will be good for your mental health.       Sandia Heights Book Club has a few openings for new members.
