  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                November/December 2007    President’s Corner    Sandia Heights Services and SHHA    Ever wonder why your SHHA dues show up on your water\Garbage bill from Sandia Heights Services?   Just what is the relationship between the two?  Well that story goes back to the inception of Sandia  Heights because it is "outside" of the city and remote in many respects. Of course the residents needed  water and garbage and some residents began a form of "neighborhood watch." About the same time the  original developers where turning over the Architectural Control Committee duties to the residents  which evolved into the SHHA. With these groups all being focused on the same objective, a better  community, working together toward a better community became an obvious alliance.    Today, we work closely with Sandia Heights Services as we know that their commercial services are  critical to the well being of our community.  I got out my bill the other day and found that for a sum  total of $20 we get membership in SHHA ($8) AND Security Protection ($12)!  For a mere $32 more  we are members of the pool!  Now, in my 30+ years in the military I got the opportunity to live in a lot  of communities and I can tell you I never saw rates this low for this level of service. So what brought  this to my attention? My security alarm. I was out of town and had a failure of a motion sensor inside  my home. Of course the alarm triggered and I got a call from ADT.  So now what do I do?  Well I had  the Sandia Heights Security cell number in my phone directory so I gave them a call at midnight.  I got a  prompt answer and a promise to check and call back.  In about 15 minutes I get a call back with a report  that all windows and doors were checked and all was OK--I slept fine that night.  They also pick up my  papers if delivery does not stop when I'm gone and they have responded to suspicious traffic in my  neighborhood.  As for the pool--heck I couldn't buy chemical supplies and maintenance for the $32 it  costs to belong.  Of course I get the services of the SHHA for only $8 and that puts over 20 folks  (mostly volunteers) working for me to maintain the character of our community.    I'm not paid or compensated in any manner by either SHHA or Sandia Heights Services--but I do know  a good deal when I see one, and I would encourage you to consider joining the Association and taking  advantage of the services offered by our friends at Sandia Heights Services.  Just because you are  getting this GRIT does not mean you are a member of SHHA--we send it to non-members as a courtesy.  So when you get you next water bill please take a look to see just what you are getting and consider  adding membership in SHHA, security and maybe the pool--I doubt there is a better deal in NM.

Most of us live on or close to an arroyo. They make fine  paths for deer, roadrunners, bear, coyotes and a myriad of other creatures living  in our unique community. I’m sure most of us enjoy the animals and assorted  other denizens in the arroyos. However, recently we have had reports and  complaints of other travelers in the arroyos. We have had reports of off-road vehicles, mostly quads  or four wheelers being ridden in some arroyos.    It is imperative that each of us takes responsibility for our actions and those of our family members.   In order to maintain our community we must all respect the property rights of others in the  community.  The arroyos are, in most cases, private property, with many homes sharing the arroyos,  as can be seen from any plat map of lots in Sandia Heights.  In some cases one land owner may  have 300-400 feet of arroyo before the next lot begins; in other cases the lot line may not include  the arroyo.  In all cases the arroyos are private property and anyone using them without the  permission of the property owner is trespassing and is in violation of New Mexico statutes.  I’m  encouraging each of you to report cases of violations to the office and we will continue to monitor  and get the appropriate officials involved if necessary.  I’m an off-road rider myself, there are many  places to use these vehicles in our wonderful state—Sandia Heights is not one of those venues.   Let’s all work to keep our community enjoyable for all.  The GRIT, Nov/Dec 2007                                                                                                                      Page 3  Community Services and Membership  Committee News ~ Kerney Bolton, Chair    New! Tram Passes for SHHA Members    The world’s longest aerial tramway, an attraction for  visitors from around the world and located right in our  own backyard has become a little more accessible to  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association members.  Just in time for the holidays, beginning November 15,  2007, up to four round-trip Tram Passes will be  available for SHHA members, each day, free of  charge! (A $17.50 value for adults, $15.00 for seniors,  $10.00 for kids under 12, for a total savings of up to  $70.00 per day)    Here is how it works:  •  First come, first served.  •  Pick up your pass(es) at the SHHA office, 2B  San Rafael, and provide a deposit of $5.00 per  pass (check or cash).  •  Turn in your used ticket stub(s) at the SHHA  office and receive a full refund of your deposit.     Details:  •  Passes will be issued for a particular date and  may be used only for that date.  •  Of course, passes are available only during days  and hours that the Tram is available to the  public.  •  Depending on demand, preference may be given  to first time Tram Pass users before repeat users.       Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series  Presents . . .    Association members who enjoyed September’s show  were not only entertained by movie & TV personality  and singer-songwriter Tim Grim, dined on great food,  and enjoyed mixing with good friends and neighbors  but discovered that the event was free. Beginning a  new policy, all Coffeehouse events will be free of  charge for Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  members. Ticket sales will replace the suggested  donation for non-members.     Suggestion . . .    For those of you who are not yet SHHA members,  your Community Services and Membership  Committee says join up and save on Tram Passes and  Coffeehouse Concerts; support your Association . . .  it’s working hard for you.        Can you identify this landscape? What do you see  that is missing? See PICTURE, Page 8.      Bylaws Committee ~ Marsha Thole, Chair        At its October meeting, the Bylaws Committee  discussed the 'officers' article for the revised bylaws.  Those positions are: president, vice president,  secretary, and treasurer. One of the things that always  comes up in such a discussion is term limits (sounds  like Congress, doesn't it?!). No one wants a dynasty in  charge, and these days an association has mechanisms  to prevent that from occurring. In reviewing the  bylaws of several other larger HOAs in  Albuquerque, one of the things they have in common  for officers is that, besides being elected yearly by the  Board of Directors, the officers have no term limits.         The person's term as an officer on the board may  end in one of four ways: (1) The officer serves the  one-year term and resigns from the board; (2) The  officer resigns at a point other than the end of the term  (in which case, the board would need to fill the  vacancy); (3) The officer is removed because he or  she is no longer qualified or eligible to serve (e.g., no  longer a member of the HOA), or (4) The officer is  removed by the Board for cause. Given the difficulty  that many boards have in finding and keeping  hardworking volunteers (and SHHA is no different in  that regard), it is reasonable to remove term limits for  officers. Where do you stand on this issue of term  limits for your board officers? We'd like to hear from  you. Just call the office to leave your comments on  how long officers should serve. No names are  needed.

You were right if you identified  Sandia Heights with Sandia Peak in the background.  This picture was taken in the early 1960’s near the  current intersection of Tramway Blvd, and San Rafael  looking northeast. What’s missing? If you said TREES  you were right again!    Sandia Heights – A New Urban  Forest? ~ Kerney Bolton       Mountain and valley views are perhaps our  greatest asset and a major reason why many of  us moved here. Slowly, almost imperceptibly,  Sandia Heights has been moving from mostly  open grasslands punctuated by yucca and cholla  toward dense urban forest. Yes, there used to be  occasional clusters of live oak and juniper scrub  and some magnificent old spring-fed  cottonwoods, but the proliferation of trees which  we see today is a byproduct of residential  development and unintended by the covenants.  Slowly, inexorably, trees are taking our  magnificent views away.       Surface water run-off from roofs and streets  has concentrated natural sources of water and  allowed invasive, non-native species to grow  where none could survive before. As a result,  nature has provided us with enormous numbers  of Siberian elm and a wide range of mixed  conifer seedlings. If you have some of these  young interlopers on your property, please  consider removing them before they become a  nuisance and much more expensive to remove.  While you are at it, please also be a good  neighbor and take a look at trees that you or a  previous owner might have planted and, if they  are obstructing your neighbor’s views, consider  pruning or removal.       The ACC is doing its part and asks for your  support. For some time now the ACC has been  disapproving applications to plant tree species  that can be expected to exceed 26 feet at  maturity or to plant trees that are not adjacent to  your house. Design Guidelines for Landscaping  are available on the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or at the SHHA Office,  2B San Rafael, behind the Quail Run Shopping  Center. They include listings of trees that will  prosper in Sandia Heights without unduly  obstructing views, and guidelines on where they  may be planted.        With homeowners and the Association  working together, we can stop and even reverse  the loss of our treasured views and recapture the  open spaces that are protected by our covenants.

Information is provided to keep residents informed  SOSH - SINGLES OF SANDIA HEIGHTS       At nearly 40 members, SOSH is moving right along. One very good reason for joining us is that the  days are getting shorter. So, you might say, what does that have to do with SOSH? Many people don't  like to drive in the dark, particularly if they are attending an event in Santa Fe, or even down at Popejoy.  Well, we have members who don't mind driving at night, so that you don't have to hibernate for the  winter all because the days are shorter.        If you are just reading about SOSH for the first time, we are a group of friendly, socially inclined  folks up here in Sandia Heights, ranging in age from the 40s to the 80s (mentally, some of us are still in  our 20s!). To reiterate--we are not  Match.com! We just like to eat, drink fine wine (or good water!),  taste different cheeses, listen to various music, and try out restaurants, check out new sites, and anything  else, limited only by your not paying attention to all the neat things going on in New Mexico. (Actually,  since I just returned from France on a tour focusing on castles, cuisine and wine, I am drooling to go  back to their fresh food and wuuuuunderful wines. So, forgive me when I say the only thing I missed  while I gone was the green chile.)        Interested in joining SOSH? Call Marsha Thole at 856-3352 to get added to the membership roster,  and start having fun!
