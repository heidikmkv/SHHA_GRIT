  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                 March 2007    MHOON’S REZONING REQUEST POSTPONED    The zoning change from A1 to R2, for the property located at the corner of Tramway Blvd and  Paseo Del Norte, is to be revised, according to Mr. Mhoon's representative, Architect Richard  Bennett. This was announced at the SHHA’s town meeting held on Feb. 5.     The revised request will be for a special use permit (SUP) for a planned residential development  (PRD). With this revised request, we will have an opportunity to review a site development plan  before it becomes an agenda item for the County Planning Commission. It is too early to tell when  this revised request will be available for our review and for County review.      At that town hall meeting, Mr. Bennett made the following important points:  a)  they do not plan to build apartments  b)  they plan to leave the main arroyo as an attractive feature  c)  they would not exceed the 26’ height limitation that is specified under R1  d)  they plan a high density for this development of 70 residences  e)  they welcome an exchange of views as they put together the site development plan for this  property    Your SHHA officers will be working with our attorney for this matter, David Campbell, to state our  position regarding this development. Many neighborhood concerns were raised at the town meeting  as Sandia Heights was well represented by residents who took advantage of the opportunity to raise  questions and issues with Mr. Mhoon’s representatives, Architect Richard Bennett and Attorney  Tim Flynn-O’Brien.     There should not be a hearing on Mr. Mhoon’s R2 request on March 7.  SHHA has set up email and  phone contact lists for notification of important meeting times and last minute changes.  If you  would like to be included in the list, please forward your phone number or email information to the  SHHA office.  Also, check the SHHA website: sandiahomeowners.org for the latest developments  on this matter.    WE NEED YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT          The SHHA is a totally volunteer organization with a prime objective of maintaining the unique  character and exceptional living conditions in our community.  In order to do this we need the support  and help of the community in running the organization.  We are now beginning the process for finding  new volunteer directors for 2007.  Board members are elected for 3-year terms with elections at the  Annual Meeting in June.  The 3 year commitment is revocable, if your personal circumstances change  you may submit a resignation letter although we would like to have members serve at least one year.  The qualifications for the job are a love of this wonderful neighborhood and a desire to work with others  to keep it vibrant.  We need representation from all of the units on the board and we urge you to  consider taking this opportunity to become a board member. Please review the duties of the committees  and other functions of the board as listed in the Directory of Residents. If you are willing to serve as a  board member, we urge you to contact Sy Caudill at 301-4508, or by email at a1200c@netzero.com.

Well over 100 friends and neighbors braved the wind and snow for the music of hammered dulcimer  virtuoso Walt Michael and fiddler extraordinaire Alexander Mitchell at the Church of the Good  Shepherd for last month’s Coffeehouse Concert Series presentation. The audience brought an  impressive array of their favorite desserts and reveled in the music, food, drink, and camaraderie.  This evening was once again made possible by our faithful volunteers, Carolyn and Ray Lobdell,  Marsha Thole, Caroline Persson-Reeves, Eric Bolton, Sue and Sy Caudill, Debbie and Mark Liebner,  and Sara and Gene Church.  The Series is produced by Linda Bolton with sound and lights provided  by Kerney Bolton.  Thanks once again to Church of the Good Shepherd for their enthusiastic support.

Letter to the Editor:         I am both a resident of Sandia Heights and a  member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA.) Membership in the SHHA  should be mandatory for all residents of Sandia  Heights. Please let me tell you why I am in favor of  this. SHHA is working on issues that affect ALL of  us, not just the members.           We have an Architectural Control Committee  dedicated to high standards in the appearance and  condition of our neighborhoods. This promotes  good property values and increases the desirability  of living here. Recently Sandia Heights was cited in  Business Week online as one of the top affordable  suburbs in the U.S. SHHA can take credit for at  least part of this. We have even taken action to  protest when the special ambiance of our open  spaces is threatened.       All of these services come at a price which  should be shared by 100% of the Sandia Heights  residents because all of us benefit from this. The  Board Members and volunteers work hard but will  get ‘burned out’ if they are not supported. We  cannot afford to let this happen. Those of us who do  not contribute are neglecting their civic duty.       It requires that all residents of Sandia Heights  recognize that these amenities only can be  preserved by giving either of your time or of  financial support. Please join SHHA today.  Respectfully submitted,   Alyson Clark, resident    The Little GRIT, March 2007    Page 7  Covenant Support Committee  - Gene Church       We thought it would be informational to  again inform the residents of Sandia Heights  concerning the function and operation of your  Covenant Support Committee (CSC).     First and foremost, the primary objective of  the CSC is to preserve the beauty and  property values of and within Sandia Heights.     But having said that, please be aware that  the committee does not function as covenant  police. We have neither the membership, nor,  since we are volunteers with other  responsibilities, the time to devote to such a  process. Instead, we depend upon you, the  concerned residents of Sandia Heights, to file  complaints when you view something that is  not in compliance with the covenants.    When you do file a complaint, we do need to  know your name and phone number, as we  often need further information.  It is the  policy of the Covenant Support Committee to  NOT divulge the name of the complainant  filing this report to the alleged violator.  However, should the violation escalate to  court proceedings, then the anonymity of the  complainant can no longer be guaranteed. It is  necessary that the complaint be submitted on  the form obtained from the SHHA office or  on-line from the website.  Phone calls to the  office, “notes” to the office, or anonymous  filings or requests will not be acted upon by  the CSC!     Since it is the membership of residents in  the SHHA who underwrite the expense of  maintenance for the office, staff, and possible  legal support, you must be a member of the  SHHA, and agree to a minimum one-year  membership, in order for the CSC to pursue a  complaint on your behalf.     Also remember that the covenants are  legally binding documents, recorded with  Bernalillo County, and they go with the  property. They are binding on all, regardless  of SHHA affiliation. Those residents who do  not belong to the SHHA may contact the  offender directly, or if necessary, pursue  compliance through legal means.      We on the CSC appreciate the support of  everyone who is making the effort to maintain  the wonderful experience of living in the most  desirable neighborhood in the area, and  probably within the state. Thank you!    W. L. Jackson Park Status  - Bob Christman        During the last several months we have  been negotiating with Bernalillo County Parks  Dept to finish the items left open. We have  been successful in adding more benches than  originally planned. The number is now 15  (original was 8) and they will be located  around the bocce court, the grass area and the  trails throughout the park. There will be a  bike rack near the existing fountain at the park  entrance and 2 new picnic tables for the shade  structure. One of the picnic tables will have  wheelchair access.      Everything has arrived and is being stored  in a county warehouse, ready to be installed  by the county maintenance personnel as  weather permits. We expect this work will  start in the next few weeks.      These furnishings will complete the park as  originally designed for the enjoyment of all  residents.    Volunteers Needed:      The Bylaws Committee is looking for 2  volunteers from the community (SHHA  members) to serve on the committee. The  committee currently meets monthly on the  first Thursday of the month at 6:30 pm, and  could meet during the day if all members  agreed to that. You do not have to be a  member of the Board to serve on this  committee. Please call Marsha Thole at   856-3352 if you are interested.
