Of note, our Architectural Control  Committee (ACC) has received an unusually large number of projects to evaluate and the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) has under review a significant number of reports. In my view, the primary  goals of "your" organization are to maintain the unique character of the community and keep close tabs  on all projects that could impact the community. The most notable issues in these areas are making sure  new\remodeling\landscaping plans comply with the covenants, that homeowner reported covenant  violations are addressed promptly, and that the community is made aware of, and involved in, rezoning  issues for land surrounding our community.    Each member of the Board of Directors serves on at least two committees. As of the time I'm writing  this article we have four less board members than we did at the annual meeting. While this has not  impacted our ability to handle the key and essential elements of operating your association, it has placed  an added workload on our volunteers. I understand the decision to become an elected member of the  board of directors requires a commitment that many homeowners cannot make at this time. However,  we also have several committees that could use part-time volunteers. I'm asking each of you to consider  devoting a few hours per month to assist us in running your association. We can use additional  volunteers on the ACC, the CSC and the Community Service and Membership Committee. If you have a  minimum of 3-4 hours per month that you could volunteer to your community, we can use your  assistance. Just call or stop by the SHHA Office or you can call me directly at 301-4508.     Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series Presents . . .

The owners, managers and employees are ready to serve you will all your hardware  needs and invite you to come in today and meet your helpful hardware folks!      LETTERS TO THE EDITOR     To the woman with three small children on bicycles who darted across Tramway through a red light at 12:50 pm  on Thursday, Aug 9--what WERE you thinking? Tramway traffic had a green light, and there were cars coming  in both directions on Tramway at 50 mph or greater (I was right at 50 mph). One driver had to swerve around all  four bikes. My ABS system brought my car to a safe stop (afraid the car behind me was going to plow into me),  and I still had the green light. I slowed down when I first saw the children. It looked at first like you were going  to wait at the corner, since you had the red light. Then, to my horror, you and the kids proceeded into the  intersection, hesitating at the median divider, looking as if you were actually going to wait there until the  southbound cars had passed, and I slowed down even more. Then, the little kids started peddling like heck to get  across, all the time hearing the horns blasting from at least two cars. I felt so sorry for them. Not once did you,  the adult, look in either direction as you crossed from the east to the west side. Those little children must have  been scared to death--I certainly was. What part of a red light don't you understand? Whether you are a driver, a  bicyclist, or a pedestrian, the red light means STOP. It is bad enough we have adults by the thousands running  red lights in this town. But now we have adults teaching children that it is okay to ride their bike across a street  against a red light. I hope you NEVER do that again. You have no idea how close you came to being wiped  out.      Marsha Thole, resident    In reference to a letter from a Marigold Drive Resident I would like to say that we too have found many dead  rabbits!  Recently, an article in the tribune addressed Rabbit fever, a disease that is seasonal and spreads in the  same manner as the plague. Tularemia, as it is called scientifically, is big in this area this summer and  is the culprit in the case of the dead bunnies. Anyone who is interested in learning more can research  information on the internet or can call the Environmental Health.
