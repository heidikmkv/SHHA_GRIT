  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                 July 2007    President’s Message by Sy Caudill    Thank you to all who attended the annual meeting on June 2. Six new directors for the  SHHA Board of Directors (BOD) were nominated and confirmed. The BOD welcomes Andy  Anderson, Alyson Clark, Frances Desonier, Peter Heinstein, Don Keller, and Mona Lee  Schilling. Marsha Thole and Bill McCall were re-elected for a 3-year term. We look forward to  their contributions in the upcoming year. We thank Thomas Coyne and Sylvia Cline whose  terms expired.   A summary of our standing committees was presented. Most all of these committees could  use volunteers to help with their projects.  If you, or someone you know, would like to  volunteer, please contact anyone on the board. There is a particular need for help on the  Community Service & Membership Committee (CS&M), the Architectural Control Committee  (ACC), and the Communications & Publications Committee. I would encourage anyone with an  interest in these areas to volunteer.   A Town Hall meeting followed the formal BOD meeting. Several individuals shared their  concern on matters in our community your inputs are always appreciated. The various areas of  concern included – covenant and ACC enforcement, emergency response times, mandatory  SHHA membership, 900 Tramway rezoning, repaving, speed humps/speeding, and pedestrian  traffic.  If you have an area of concern, please contact us at the office or e-mail at  shha@sandiahomeowners.org. We continue to welcome your input and I look forward to  working with the BOD to bring our community closer together.    Financial Note:   An independent annual audit for 2006 was conducted by a committee of  4, consisting of Bob Francis, chairman, Cheryl Iverson, Robert Des Jardin and  Larry Anderson. All four are very qualified individuals and I would like to  thank them for their time and effort in doing this important task. The audit  review was conducted in accordance with our Bylaws and in compliance with  the State Statutes. The report gave us a clean bill of health and also produced  several procedural recommendations that are helping our every day operation.  The Board accepted this report and the result of the financial review is  available in the SHHA office if you are interested. The next Independent Financial Review will be  scheduled in 2008 to examine the financial records ending December 2007.    Mark Your Calendar! Be sure to save Saturday, Sept. 29, for the next Sandia  Heights Coffeehouse Concert at Church of the Good Shepherd, featuring wonderful Indiana  singer/songwriter Tim Grimm.

ACC Reminder to homeowners:  This is the time of year when homeowners start thinking  about landscaping. As a quick reminder, do not forget to submit an application to the ACC if you are  planning a major landscaping project, whether it is inside or outside your walls and fences. Keep in mind  that trees must not exceed 26 ft. when mature, and that there are a number of trees and other plants that  are banned by the County and SHHA. For some assistance, check out the ACC Design Guideline for  Landscaping on the SHHA website sandiahomeowners.org, it contains a listing of pre-approved trees.  Members are welcome to visit the office to review the Contractor Evaluation Book, if you are seeking  information on landscapers. Minor replacement of individual dead shrubs and plants and general  gardening upkeep are encouraged, and do not require an application. Please note tree replacements do  require an application. You may refer to our landscaping guidelines on the website for more information.

Activities in the past month have included the Memorial  Day ceremonies at the NM Veterans Memorial and a wonderful cookout (complete with burned hot  dogs and buns--'cook' is a 4-letter word that some of us don't do), the Buddy Guy blues guitarist  concert at the Lensic in Santa Fe, an Isotopes game, a cooking class with wine pairings at Le  Café Miche, dinner at Pelican's, dancing, a day trip to Torreon for the Eastern Navajo Arts & Crafts  Festival, and a day trip to the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos for the "Diebenkorn in New  Mexico" exhibit, that had a great write-up in the ABQ Journal.        Upcoming activities include the Backstage Tour at the Opera (Santa Fe), a Chile Supper, the  Paul Taylor Dance Company at the Lensic Theater in Santa Fe, a visit to the Unser Racing  Museum, a Santa Fe day trip to the Georgia O’Keeffe and the Institute of American Indian Arts  Museums and lunch, and tea at Another Place 'N' Time in their gardens in Tijeras. Men and women  are welcome (age 40+, single, divorced, widowed, living alone due to a commuter marriage). The  purpose is to have fun and socialize with others AND save on gas by carpooling! If your social life  could be described as D & B (no, that doesn't stand for Dun & Bradstreet, it stands for Dull &  Boring), then consider SOSH to liven things up a bit. For more information, please call Marsha  Thole (856-3352).           T-Mobile Cell Tower Update: We appreciate the responses we have received regarding the  T-mobile Cell Tower proposal at Futures for Children and always want homeowner’s inputs and  comments on matters of concern within Sandia Heights. I would like to make sure that everyone has a  clear understanding of the process involved with all proposals before the County Commission or the  Planning Board.  Anyone can, and seemingly does, put forth changes to their property that requires  Bernalillo County approval. We strive to make sure we are aware of these actions and then we seek  homeowner inputs to help formulate our position. Regardless of the position we take, we are only  providing an "opinion" for the county to consider. We have no greater standing than an individual that  elects to address the commission. We have no "veto" or other authority as the final decision on these  matters is solely up to the commission. The view corridor is an issue for the commission, they must  decide this issue, and it is not an area that we have any control over.  Having said that, we have a second internal issue that we must address. That is competing or opposing  views of Sandia Heights homeowners. In many cases, as in the case of the cell tower, we have  conflicting inputs. Some homeowners oppose or want to have input on the design\height or other  aspects of the proposal. Others, as in this case, strongly support the cell tower as they have that service  and they desire better reception and connectivity for their cell phones. In these instances we must craft  our position to reflect both concerns--if at all possible. We have clearly stated that we want to  minimize the impact on views, as this is a concern for many homeowners. On the other side we  recognize that reception is a major concern for others and therefore we do not unilaterally reject the  installation. Our goal is a balanced input to reflect the need for better reception while at the same time  maintaining the unique character of the Sandia Heights neighborhood.  As I mentioned earlier, our standing with the commission is the same as any other person desiring to  address an issue before the commission. I would strongly urge you attend the meetings when this issue  is an agenda item and present your views to the commission.
