President’s Message By Dick Cline    Re-Election Results  The regular election of officers at the April meeting was postponed for lack of a quorum until the May  Board of Director meeting. The following is the slate of officers elected for the 2007-2008 operational  year:      Sy Caudill, President    Ed Tull, Vice President    Ed Whitten, Treasurer  Bill McCall will continue serving as Secretary until we find a replacement    As your outgoing president, I would like to thank both the BOD and the residents for their support this  past year. It has been a busy and fulfilling year. I must step down from a busy officer schedule for  personal reasons but will remain on the board and work as needed on various committees. I wish our  new officers the best of success in the upcoming year and I am confident that they will provide  excellent leadership.  I hope to see many of you at the SHHA annual meeting. The annual meeting is an important event so I  hope for a good turn out.    New Board Member nominees:  Andy Anderson, 507 Black Bear Lp.

Their proposal is still to replace a utility pole with their cell tower, however, PNM requires  that the antennas must be 10 feet above the high voltage wires. This change would make the top of  the antennas approximately 15 feet above the current height of the utility pole. The SHHA informed  T-Mobile that this proposal is most likely unacceptable to the residents. At the 30 April meeting  with the T-Mobile representative and some of the residents, the message was made quite clear that  they must come up with a more acceptable solution. T-Mobile took several action items to look at  other options. The next hearing with the County is still scheduled for Tuesday, 26 June. We will  keep you updated on any new information.

Everyone is exposed to Radon at  some level. Millions of homes and buildings contain high levels of Radon gas. The EPA and the  Office of the Surgeon General recommend that all homes below the third floor be tested for Radon.  Because Radon is invisible and odorless, a simple test is the only way to determine if a home has  high Radon levels. For more Radon information, go to www.cabq.gov/airquality/radonfaq.html     Health Effects from Radon Exposure:     No immediate symptoms.     Estimated to contribute to between 7,000 and 30,000 lung cancer deaths each year.     Smokers are at higher risk of developing Radon-induced lung cancer.     Steps to Reduce Exposure to Radon     Test your home for Radon - it is easy and inexpensive.     Take action if your Radon level is 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) or higher.     Radon levels of less than 4 pCi/L still pose a risk, and in many cases, may be reduced.     How to Get a Free Radon Test Kit:  If you live in Bernalillo County you can get a test kit from the Air Quality Division by calling 768- 1972 or email aqd@cabq.gov .       Brickell Bush Invasion  By Bob Francis, Master Gardener    For the past two years I have noticed an outbreak of Brickell Bush in Sandia Heights in Unit 11,  along Marigold and Laurel Loop. The Brickell Bush is a very wood, annual, cresol plant with a high  fire danger. The Brickell Bush can reach a height of 6 feet. Google shows it as Brickellia:  miscrophylla ssp. Scabra. Rabbit brush, rough cocklebur. The flower or cocklebur scatters hundreds  of seeds.     According to the New Mexico Agriculture Extension Service, the variety of Brickell Bush in the  Sandia foothills is known as the small leaf Brickell Bush. The Brickell Bush roots will crowd out  and kill chamisa and cholla plants. You will find the Brickell bush among your cactus, chamisa,  cholla, apache plume, and yucca plants. It will take over your landscape if you allow it to spread.  There is also a large area of Brickell Bush growth in Unit 9, along Tramway and Deer Drive.  Eradication can be accomplished by spraying with weed killer when the plants are less than 8  inches. Larger plant can be broken at their base and dug out.    Letter to the Editor:  Thanks to whoever cleaned up the graffiti on a concrete block at the NW corner of Tramway and  San Rafael. I don’t know how it was removed, but I’m grateful.
