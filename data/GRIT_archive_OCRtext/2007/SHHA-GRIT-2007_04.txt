        President’s Message:   Curbs -  We are aware that some curbs have been damaged by the snow ploughs. The county has been in the  area driving around and making a list of needed repairs. If your curb has been damaged and not yet  fixed, please call County Road Maintenance at 848-1540.    Rezoning Tramway 900 -  At the County Planning Commission (CPC) meeting on March 7, Mr. Mhoon’s rezoning request  was deferred until Wednesday, July 11. It was also understood that Mhoon’s R-2 request will be  amended to a Special Use Permit request. Mr. Mhoon’s representative initiated this request and  SHHA agreed to it. A Special Use Permit requires many different plans prior to approval by the  CPC. The site development should include the lot layouts, road plan, drainage plan, utilities layout,  etc. Once these are available, we will call a town hall meeting.    Proposed Unified Covenants  CSC has rewritten comments gathered from homeowners into version 19 and it is awaiting board  action. If you wish to have a copy of version 19 please come to the SHHA office to obtain one.     Community Service & Membership Committee  -  Sylvia Cline    The wine-tasting event we had planned for May had to be cancelled. We have not been able to find  a location nearby and it has been difficult finding wine purveyors. We regret the cancellation of the  event this year.

Proposed T-Mobile Cell Tower Update  - Ed Whitten, SHHA Treasurer    T-Mobile has proposed a different solution to their original plan for a Cell Tower at Futures for  Children. Their new plan seems to be a much more acceptable solution.  As a result of this  changed plan, T-mobile will be asking for a 90 day deferral on their request to the County  Commissioners which was originally scheduled for 27 March.   We have been talking and meeting with T-Mobile on this new plan and we will continue to work  with them with the intent of reaching an acceptable solution to most residents, Futures for  Children and T-mobile. At a meeting recently with representatives from Brushwood, members of  SHHA Executive Committee and the T-Mobile representative, it was agreed that the proposed  Cell Tower might be acceptable to most residents with a few conditions. T-Mobile has agreed to  work within these conditions. They will keep us informed as the detail plans evolve and to  Futures position. Likewise, we will keep you informed on these detail plans and follow on  hearings.      The GRIT April 2007                                                                                                           Page 11    Home Safety Tips    Chores like reorganizing closets and tackling a thorough spring cleaning can put families at even  greater risk for falls and poisoning – the two leading causes of home injury in America. The  Home Safety Council urges families to keep safe practices top of mind while cleaning up and  cleaning out your home, garage and yard.    1. When cleaning out closets or reorganizing, always keep stairs, steps, landings and all  floors clear.  2. Carry loads you can see over, and keep one hand free to hold banisters and railings  3. Five gallon buckets are often used while cleaning and present a serious drowning danger  to young children. Never leave a bucket or any standing water unattended and store  buckets empty and upside-down.  4. Follow safety recommendations when using harsh products, such as wearing gloves and  masks. Do not mix products together because their contents could react with dangerous  results.  5. Never use gasoline as a cleaning solvent and never use or store gasoline in your home,  even in tiny quantities. Because its vapors can readily ignite, it is too dangerous to use  gasoline for any purpose other than as a motor fuel.  6. When cleaning out cabinets, separate dangerous products and medication and lock them  up, out of reach of children.  7. Remember to reduce clutter and safely tuck away telephone and electrical cords out of  walkways. In homes with children, make sure toys and other items are always safely put  away when not in use.  8. If you need to climb, use a stepladder or ladder. When using a ladder, stand at or below  the highest safe standing level. For a stepladder, the safe standing level is the second rung  from the top, and for an extension ladder, it’s the fourth rung from the top. Before using,  make sure the rungs are dry.      Concealed Cell Phone Facility at Tramway Blvd & San Rafael    The County Planning Commission (CPC) will hear a request from an agent of T-Mobile for a  Special Use Permit to install a cell phone antenna and related equipment at 2-B San Rafael Ave  NE (same building that houses the SHHA office.) An existing enclosure on the roof at the  western end of the building would be heightened by a few feet and the antenna would be  installed inside. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) has informed T-Mobile that the  covenant for unit 16 specifically prohibits “public utility use or structure” on any tract in the unit.  The CPC hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, April 4, 2007 in the Vincent E Griego chambers,  Concourse Level II, City/County Building, One Civic Plaza NW, Albuquerque, NM.
