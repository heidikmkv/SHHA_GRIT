The sheriff was notified.  Word to the wise, expect the sheriff to spend more time in this area showing a laser enforced presence.  Speed limits are as posted or as New Mexico law dictates at 15mph in unmarked residential areas.    The Bernalillo County Water Conservation Ordinance went into effect on April 2; it is similar to the  City of Albuquerque's. Some of the restrictions are (1) No spray watering between 11:00 A.M. and  7:00 P.M., and (2) no water runoff allowed. More restrictions can be found on the County's website at  www.Bernco.gov, Water Conservation.    No officers were elected at the April board meeting because of a lack of a quorum. Elections will be  held at the May meeting and results will announced on the website and in the GRIT.     The following is a list of candidates for the 2007/2008 Board of Directors from the Nominating  Committee. Candidate profiles are on file in the office if you would like to review them. New board  members will be voted on at the annual meeting.
