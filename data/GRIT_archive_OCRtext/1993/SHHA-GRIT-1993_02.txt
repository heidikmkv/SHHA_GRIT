THE  Volume 93  February 1993  SHHA Board Selects New Executive Assistant  "Lenore Lee Miner, former Technical  Assistance Coordinator for the Hispanic  Culture Foundation, has been contracted  as the new Executive Assistant to the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Associa- tion (SHHA) starting February 1," an- nounced Louis Mantle, 1992-93 SHHA  President.  Lee replaces Sherry Lombana who has  served as the Association's Executive As- sistant since November, 1989. Sherry  recently resigned her contract with the  SHHA to pursue opportunities in the  writing and editing fields.  "With an educational background in  business management and marketing, Lee  has th~ expertise the Board of Directors  was seeking for the Executive Assistant's  position," Lou said. "Previous experi- ence working with volunteer boards of  directors and non-profit organizations,  combined with skills in the area of news- letter production, made Lee an ideal can- didate for this position."  From 1989 to 1991, Lee was the Man- aging Director of one of Albuquerque's  performing arts companies, a position  that required considerable organization  and management skills and the ability to  deal with diverse programs and person- alities. "Those are the qualities that the  Board looks for in the individual who's  contracted as the Executive Assistant,"  Lou said. Lee already has attended a  number of Board meetings, committee  meetings, and several orientation ses- sions to assure a smooth transition.  Like the former SHHA Executive As- sistant, Lee is not a Sandia Heights resi- dent and will be working out of her home/  office, Lou reported. Though the SHHA  Board of Directors is convinced that it's  preferable to have a non-resident serving  as the Executive Assistant to the Associa- tion, not having an office location within  the community occasionally presents  some logistical problems. Several times  over the past few years, the SHHA Board  has considered opening on office in one  of the commercial office spaces within  the Sandia Heights community. How- ever for the present, it's been decided to  tolerate the inconveniences in order to  keep the Association's overhead expe ses  at a minimum.  Lee Miner's mailing address is 7213  Carson Trail NW, Albuquerque, 87120;  the new SHHA office number is 899- 8611.  Louis Mande, 1992-93 SHHA President,  and Lenore Lee Miner, newly  contracted Executive Assistant  1qcr3  Number I  Board Examines  Present & Future  SHHA Services  A revised approach to handling cov- enant enforcement, the attempted acqui- sition of liability insurance for the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association  (SHHA), and a commitment to the main- tenance and management of Sandia  Heights Park only up to the expiration of  the current lease in the fall of 1997 were  the primary decisions from the SHHA's  recent planning process.  Concerns over projected budget defi- cits and increasing costs associated with  providing architectural review services  were the impetus behind the SHHA Board  of Directors' decision to appoint an SHHA  Planning Task Force. The task force,  appointed by SHHA President Louis  Mande, was charged with examining the  services currently provided by the Asso- ciation to its members and recommend- ing to the Board of Directors which of  those services should be continued and  how the services should be performed.  Directors comprising the task force were  Chair Tom Wray, Co-Chair Robin Otten,  Jon Cashwell, Bob Chenhall, Bill Stabler,  Andres Viamonte, and Lou Mande.  The task force met three times over a  two-month period. The following recom- mendations were presented and approved  at the SHHA Board of Directors meeting  on November 11, 1992.

Santa Fe -- The sixty day legislative session is now underway. We expect it  to be a very busy and hectic one, and hopefully a productive effort for the people  we represent.  Among issues confronting the 112 members in the legislature (70-House; 42- Senate ): DWI; increased funding for public education; public health reform;  legislative ethics reform; auto insurance changes; retail electric wheeling; taxes  on cigarettes, liquor, and natural gas; review of a $2.2 billion state budget for  the coming fiscal year; and many other equally important issues. Over 2,000  bills are likely to be introduced.  Please contact us via the legislative switchboard (986-4300) if you wish to  discuss any issue important to you, or to arrange for committee testimony  supporting or challenging passage of a particular bill. Our secretaries can also  check on bill status on the daily Bill Locator, upon your inquiry.  If you have a son or daughter (ages seven through fourteen), who would like  to be a Legislative Page for a day during the session, please contact one of us  so we can make the arrangements. They will learn much about our legislative  process, and pick up $10 at the same time!  Finally, our sincere gratitude to outgoing SHHA Executive Assistant Sherry  Lombana for her diligent work for our community. Her efforts have had much  to do with both maintaining and improving the unique quality of life in the  Sandia Heights area. She will be greatly missed.  Mark Caruso  State Representative, District 23  119~  Kip Nicely  State Representative, District 31  Tom Wray  State Senator, District 21  Page 3  ----- ----- - -- - - ---- --- - ---- -- -- ---- - -- -- -- - -- ~  BOARD  D A public hearing on the final draft of the Ground-Water Protection Policy (GPPAP) will be held on Thur., Feb.11,  1993 at 6:30 p.m. at the City Council/County Commission Chambers, One Civic Plaza NW. The hearing will be  held before a joint meeting of the City Environmental Planning Commission and the County Planning Commission.  The most controversial part of the policy is the proposed action plan which would prevent the installation of  conventional septic systems in Sandia Heights. In addition, septic systems needing repair would have to be replaced  with alternative systems. Estimated costs for retrofitting a home for an alternative system start at $7,500 and go up  from there. With proper care and maintenance, the average "life" for a septic system is 15 to 20 years which puts  many homes in Sandia Heights at that repair/ replacement stage. Persons who would like more information on the  GPP AP may call SHHA Director Robin Otten at 298-7244.  D  PLEASE HELP! The Foothills Trails system is receiving extensive use (see Special Recreation Insert in this issue)  and is in need of some routine maintenance. If you, your family members, or friends would be willing to volunteer  for this worthwhile project, please call SHHA Parks & Recreation Director Ed Whitten (296-1884). A work party  is planned for the February/March time frame. Jane Cropp with the U.S. Forest Service (281-3304) will be  organizing the work project. Everyone who participated in the last work party in October had a wonderful time and  great feeling of accomplishment.  D  Bernalillo County and the Albuquerque Metropolitan Area Flood Control Authority (AMAFCA) are considering  construction of some low profile dams in the national forest area east of Sandia Heights. The dams would be  constructed of natural materials and would help control erosion and regulate the flow of water for 15- to 20-year  storms. For purposes of comparison, the South Domingo Baca and Pino Dams just west of Sandia Heights are  designed to handle 200-year storms. Persons with questions or comments about the proposed dams may contact  Darryl Millet, President of the North Albuquerque Acres Community Association, at 293-0105.  D The SHHA has received confirmation that AMAFCA has granted the County a license to build and maintain a small  neighborhood park adjacent to the biking/hiking trail on the east side of Tramway Blvd. at the South Domingo Baca  Channel (vicinity of San Bernadino). The park will be designed both as a rest stop for trail users and as a toddler  park with equipment for small children. The County license for the park came as a result of some persuasive l_obbying  by SHHA Director Janey Brink and efforts by Patricia Cassidy, former County Commissioner for District 4. Thank  you Janey and Pat! Persons with questions or comments about the park may contact Janey at 291-8910.  D Centex Homes has started grading for the new 86 home subdivision on the southwest corner of San Rafael and  Tramway Blvd. The subdivision has been named Willow Bend, and construction on the models is expected to begin  in March, 1993. SHHA members with questions about Willow Bend may call SHHA Director of New Development  Andres Viamonte at 298-8418.  D SHHA Director Janey Brink has been appointed to serve on the Bernalillo County Arts Board which is responsible  for making recommendations to the Bernalillo County Commission on the acquisition of works of art for county- owned facilities. Establishment of the Ans Board was part of the Art in Bernalillo County Public Places Ordinance  adopted by the County Commission in August, 1992. The ordinance stipulates that projects in the Capital  Improvement Program shall include an amount for works of art equal to one percent of the total cost of the project.  Janey was appointed to the Arts Board in October, 1992 by Patricia Cassidy, former County Commissioner for  District 4.  D Sandia Heights residents are reminded that the County Animal Control Ordinance requires animals (including cats)  to be confined on their own premises. It is both inconsiderate and against County ordinance to allow animals to create  a nuisance on someone else's property. This includes the "deposits" that your dog makes while you're out jogging,  walking, or biking. Please take a bag along and "poop scoop" after your dog. This has become a particular problem  in subdivisions where neighbors live in closer proximity to one another (like Tramway Terrace, Los Altos de Sandias,  Habitat, Cedar Canyon, Brushwood, etc.).

SHHA Explores Recycling Options  The Sandia Heights Homeowners As- sociation (SHHA) Recycling Committee  is still active despite the City's cancella- tion of all neighborhood drop-off recy- cling programs.  All neighborhood recycling programs  were discontinued in both the City and  County in October, 1992 despite the fact  that only the City of Albuquerque imple- mented curbside recycling. Gene Romo,  Director of the City's Solid Waste Man- agement Department, stated that the  drivers, laborers, and trucks involved in  neighborhood drop-off recycling would  have to be transferred to the City's  curbside pick up program. Besides the  SHHA's program, there were two other  recycling efforts in unincorporated areas  of Bernalillo County that also were can- celled -- the South Valley Los Padillas  Community Service Center and North  Valley Alameda School.  All possible avenues for funding a new  recycling effort are being explored, re- ports Janey Brink, SHHA Recycling  Chair. Janey recently visited with Jimi  Gadzia, Manager of the Southwest Pub- lic Recycling Association (SPRA). The  SPRA recently received a grant from the  New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and N atu- ral Resources Department to develop a  Cooperative Marketing and Transporta- tion Program in New Mexico to serve  both rural and urban recycling programs.  Though recycling prospects through the  SPRA program look promising, Janey  stated that the benefits probably would  not be realized for some time to come and  would require support and participation  by Bernalillo County. SHHA members  with ideas or suggestions on recycling can  reach Janey at 291-8910.  The Association's Recycling Commit- tee urges Sandia Heights homeowners to  do whatever their time and financial re- sources will allow during this period to  support recycling and source reduction.  Following is a list of possible outlets for  recyclable materials.  S. T .E.P. One Recycling. This company  will pick up recyclables at your home  twice a month for a $5 monthly fee. As an  added benefit, they also pick up many  items for recycling that the City of Albu- querque would not accept. Call 898-0585  for information on acceptable recyclables.  Recycle America. This company does  not offer home pick up, and they have no  drop-off locations. All recyclables must  be brought to 2330 South 2nd St. SW (one  mile south of the Stadium Bridge over- pass). For information on acceptable  recyclables, call 247-0117 or 247-0118.  Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Cen- ters.  Contact person is Mike Padilla  (345-2405). The plant is located at 4300  Ellison NE (345-2404) and accepts alu- minum from Monday through Saturday,  9 a.m.-5 p.m. All other drop-off points  accept aluminum Tuesdays through Sat- urdays, and specific times are listed for  each location. In some cases, there also  are bins for newspapers at these loca- tions. However the bins do seem to move  around, so a definitive list of newspaper  outlets was not available.

With this in mind in 1991, The Vaughan Company opened its  Estate Properties Division.  Estate properties were growing in number and represented a unique challenge to the agents who  represented them. The Estate Properties Division of The Vaughan Company Realtors was formed  to meet that challenge.  Through special training of sales agents and intense management and company support, we feel like  we can off er the finest of knowledgeable, professional, and discreet representation of estates  properties to be found anywhere in the Southwest. With the support of our Estate'sDirectors and  award-winning management team, we hope that our sales associates can gain the respect and  trust of clientele who seek to purchase or sell the finest properties in New Mexico.  When making that all-important decision of who to choose to assist you, you will see why The  Vaughan Company has been the preferred choice by the majority of the estate owners over the  past ten years.  ~o=~  Douglas~ughan  President, CCIM, CRB, CRS  Page 5  For private consulation, call your area directors, Judson & Sharon McCollum.

I am  ~  excited to be here and hope that you will feel free to contact  me at 768-4001 if I can be of assistance.  Currently, I am continuing to monitor the status of Tram- way Blvd. as it relates to limited access and truck traffic. The  Commercial Vehicle Network For The Albuquerque Urban  Area submitted by the Urban Area Truck Route Task  Group, a subcommittee of the Middle Rio Grande Council  of Governments, does not designate Tramway Blvd. as a  truck route. While I do not anticipate that such a designation  will be made, I will keep you apprised of any and all  developments on this matter. The first public hearing on  truck routes is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Wed., Feb. 12 at  Sandia High School.  On another matter, I recently met with representatives of  AMAFCA, the U.S. Forest Service, Open Space Task Force,  Soil Conservation, and others, to discuss drainage problems  in Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres. I've been  informed that the long-awaited FEMA Report will be avail- able this year. Future meetings, to include neighborhood  participation, are being scheduled, and I assure you that this  issue will be a top priority during my administration.  County Commission Chairman Patrick Baca has made  committee assignments for 1993, and I will be serving on the  following boards and/ or committees: Middle Rio Grande  Council of Governments Executive Committee and Finance  Committee; Urban Transportation Policy Planning Board;  ------.,  the Legislative Committee which prioritizes the County's  "wish list" before each legislative session; the Investment  Committee which reviews the County's investment policies  and practices; the Corrections/Detention Conference Com- mittee which, with City Council members, works out the  budget for the jail and reviews other jail-related issues; the  Intergovernmental Committee, a joint City-County board  which acts as a forum for the discussion and resolution of  issues of mutual interest and benefit to the residents of  Bernalillo County and the City of Albuquerque.

Call the Sandia Peak  Tram Co. (296-9585) for information on security services and subscription rates.  Security Tips:  *Use reflective numbers a minimum of two inches in height (four inches are  optimum) to put your address on both sides of your mailbox. On Sandia  Heights' dark and winding streets, this can make a critical difference in how  ~uickly the County Sheriff, security patrol, fire, and rescue locate your house  m an emergency.  * Be certain your security system is operating properly. Leave information on  how to reset your security alarm with a neighbor. Alarms that go off frequently  and for long periods not only are bothersome to your neighbors but also can  cause complacency in the event of a real emergency.

Phase III encompasses the road im- provements from Paseo del Norte north  to the 3-way stop sign at Tramway Rd.  The project also includes the continua- tion of the jogging/biking path -- now  terminating at Paseo del Norte -- all the  way to Tramway Rd.  Carl Lovato, who served as the Project  Engineer for Phases I and II of Tramway  Blvd. improvement, is expected to con- tinue in that capacity throughout Phase  III. Persons with questions about the  road construction can reach Lovato at  843-6120. Grant Snyder also is expected  to continue as Construction Manager for  the project. Snyder can be reached at  299-7016.  The contract for landscaping Phase II  of the Tramway Blvd. project (from  Montgomery north to Paseo de! Norte)  has been awarded to Baca's Trees. In- stallation of the irrigation system will  begin in the spring, followed by planting  in the late spring and summer. Funds for  landscape installation from Montgomery  to Paseo del Norte were secured through  a grant from the Federal Highway En- hancement Program.  AVID Engineering, design firm for  this phase of the Tramway Project, also is  responsible for the landscaping design  for Phase III. However Lovato reports  that, like Phase II, no funds were allotted  in the construction budget for landscape  planting. And since this section of the  road does not terminate at a major arte- rial street, it's ineligible for Federal High- way Enhancement funds.  Mary Colton, SHHA Director in charge  of the Tramway Improvement Project  and Chair of the Tramway Beautification  Committee, reports that the committee  will, once again, seek grant monies from  various sources to complete Tramway  landscaping and beautification.  Page 8  Holiday Lights  Shone Brightly  The 1992 holiday lights in Sandia  Heights were beautiful this year!  Though quite a few SHHA members  created some lovely lights' displays, many  didn't take the time to fill out an entry  form for the annual Holiday Lights Con- test. Sue Jourdan, member of the SHHA  Board of Directors and organizer of this  year's contest, said the Parks & Recre- ation Committee hopes more people will  become official contest entrants in 1993.  Entrants were judged for creativity,  novelty, effort, and presentation. The  cash prize winners were:  1st Place  Gary and Kathi Williams  569 Black Bear Rd.  Traditional Display  Stephen & Maureen Baca  977 Antelope Ave.  Luminaria Display  2nd Place  Don & Barbara Robertson  1455 Bluebell Dr.  Traditional Display  3rd Place  David & Norma Leeper  801 Tramway Ln.  Traditional Display  4th Place  James Smuda  955 Antelope Ave.  Traditional Display  The following displays earned honor- able mentions: Leonard & Donna DeLue,  30 Sandia Heights Dr.; Don & Peggy  DeGasperi, 975 Antelope Ave.; Barney  Doyle, 973 Antelope Ave.  Thanks to all residents who took time  from their busy schedules to decorate  their homes. The displays added so much  to the holiday spirit and were greatly  appreciated by all. A special thanks to  SHHA Director Sue Jourdan for her  time spent organizing this year's contest.

Now after decades of experience,  we are taking a second look at chemicals  and rethinking their use. We fear that to  solve some of our problems, we create  others we cannot control.  An exciting "second look" is taking  place in our area to consider the effects  and kinds of home landscape pest man- agement. Funded by the US Department  of Agriculture, New Mexico State Uni- versity Cooperative Extension Service has  implemented a three year study called  Urban Integrated Pest Management  Project (IPM). It will study means of  controlling pests (insects, weeds, disease  and others such as snails, deer, rabbits)  without FIRST resorting to toxic chemi- cals. The aim is not to eliminate chemical  controls but to use the least toxic effective  means before resorting to chemicals.  Alternative controls range from cultural  and biological to hand picking pests and  the use of less toxic chemicals. This  concept has proven very successful in our  national forests and parks and in agricul- tural areas; it should work well in urban  areas too.  Headed by Dr. Charles Ward, urban  entomologist, the project will determine  (1) the most serious pest problems in  urban landscape plantings; (2) at what  point does the homeowner decide that  action is necessary to combat the pest; (3)  at what point does the homeowner believe  the plant aesthetics are compromised by  the pest; (4) what workable and reliable  alternatives to chemical controls for these  SHHA Community Coffees  pests can be developed; ( 5) if an Integrated  Pest Management program would be  profitable as a commercial business,  provided public demand develops.  The project will identify existing  landscape pests in our area, find out who  maintains the landscape, including pest  control, and where the maintainer gets  his (or her) information.  Urban  Albuquerque landscapes will be  monitored on a weekly basis for 1, 2 or 3  years. Also, an IPM education program  will be developed to inform the public  about its ability to reduce toxic chemical  applications, reduce soil and water  contamination, and to train individuals in  IPM techniques.  Probably, the name IPM will be changed  in the future to Plant Health Care as  methods are developed for pest problem  prevention through proper horticultural  practices:  Proper site, proper plants,  proper planting and cultivations. If you  would like to know more about the  program and, possibly, to participate, call  Susan Wachter at 275-2576.  -- Jean Heflin  Meet new neighbors and see .. old" friends at the community coffees.

Page 12  Future Plans  Continued from page 1  Covenant Support  The SHHA should only respond and take action on written  complaints submitted to the Association regarding alleged  covenant violations. The name and address of the complainant  must appear on the letter, and guarantees of anonymity should  not be made. The SHHA Executive Assistant, or other Board  designee, will ascertain the validity of the complaint based on  the covenants for that particular unit. In cases where the  covenants are vague, alleged violations will be referred to the  Architectural Review Committee and/ or the Legal Advisor for  a decision.  Valid covenant complaints will be turned over to the Cov- enant Support Committee for site inspection and verification.  Fallowing verification of a violation, a letter will be prepared on  SHHA letterhead by the Executive Assistant, or other Board  designee, and will go out over the signature of the current  Covenant Support Chair. Follow-up activities on covenant  violations will comply with the Covenant Enforcement Proce- dures approved by the SHHA Board in January, 1991 which call  for long-term violations to be turned over to the SHHA  attorney.  Architectural Review  The SHHA should continue to provide architectural review  services in accordance with current SHHA-approved policies  and procedures for the twenty-four (24) subdivisions now under  the purview of the SHHA Architectural Review Committee,  provided that adequate insurance can be obtained and afforded  by the Association to cover legal expenses if the SHHA, the  Committee, and/ or persons under contract by the SHHA or the  Committee are named in a lawsuit arising from, or relating to,  architectural review actions that they may take or fail to take.  Sandia Heights Park  The SHHA should continue to maintain Sandia Heights Park  for daytime use; control access to the park to curtail graffiti and  other unacceptable/illegal activities; schedule group use of the  park and collect appropriate fees; support the acquisition and  development of an area where the SHHA's recently purchased  children's play equipment can be moved; support and promote  the development of nearby day-use parks and playing fields to  meet the community's recreational needs.  The SHHA should not lobby any person, company, or  government entity for extension or renewal of the lease for the  Sandia Heights Park site. The SHHA should get out of the park  business no later than the expiration date (September, 1997) on  the current lease agreement between Sandia Pueblo and the  Sandia Peak Tram Co. for the Sandia Heights Park site.  Community Representation  The SHHA should continue to be vigilant of city, county, and  state governmental activities that may affect the quality of life  in the community. The Association should provide direct  representation of the SHHA through memoranda, letters,  reports, testimony, and appearances before the appropriate  governmental entities and through contact with other neighbor- hood associations, developers, businesses, and individuals.  Communications  The SHHA should continue to provide communication ser- vices to its members as well as to new residents and prospective  members. Such services should include new residents packets  and "welcome" letters; the quarterly GRIT newsletter; the  annual Sandia Heights Residents Directory; other communica- tions, as needed, to inform and alert the membership about  specific events or developments (i.e., political forums, public  meetings, etc.).  Community Projects & Social Activities  The SHHA should continue to sponsor . and assist with  specific projects of interest to the Sandia Heights community.  These would include sponsorship of neighborhood recycling,  community coffees, Spring Fling, Holiday Crafts Bazaar, Holi- day Lights Contest, community beautification, etc.  Homeowners Referral Program  The SHHA should continue to maintain, update, and expand  the file of referral forms and information provided by Sandia  Heights residents on contractors and service providers, and to  make that information available to SHHA members upon  request.
