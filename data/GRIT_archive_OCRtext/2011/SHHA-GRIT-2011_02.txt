    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           February 2011                 President’s Message by   Phyllis Moore         December and January have been very  busy months for our SHHA volunteers and  Board Members and especially your  President.    The SHHA Septic Tank Committee has  been plowing ahead and making good  progress regarding our Septic Tank issue  within Sandia Heights. I think an article  will be in the next GRIT regarding their  progress to date.         Also we have worked collaboratively  with our District 4 County Commissioner,  Michael Weiner, to establish a meeting for  Sandia Heights residents regarding the  motorcycle noise on Tramway Blvd and the  proposed Noise Ordinance change. This  meeting was planned for 29 January to  address both topics.  Hopefully all  interested residents attended as you will be  reading this GRIT after the meeting.        We will continue to keep you informed  regarding the proposed Noise Ordinance  change via our monthly GRIT and our  SHHA website. As many of you already  know the December 14 hearing on the  Noise Ordinance was delayed until 8  February 2011. Please check our website  frequently for any other possible changes or  delays.      Nomination Committee             We are beginning our search for new  officers interested in serving on the SHHA  Board for next year (2011-2012). We  currently have a great team and I know we  will need additional volunteers and Board  Members as we begin our new year that  starts at our annual meeting in June.  Please  drop me an email kfry4956@yahoo.com or  give me a phone call at 828-1689 so we can  discuss and explore your interest as an  SHHA Board Member or a volunteer on a  specific committee. We need your ideas,  your different perspectives and your skills  in order to effectively serve this unique  community that we all call home.       IN MEMORIAM    It is with great sadness that SHHA  informs you of the passing of Sandia  Heights resident and SHHA Board  member Mike Winokur on December 23,  2010.  Mike joined the Board in 2006,  and has chaired the Community Service  and Membership Committee as well as  served as a member of the Architectural  Control Committee. He was a very  active volunteer for Meet ‘n Greet events  and Coffeehouse Concerts, and was  always willing to help with other Sandia  Heights activities. We will miss his  positive outlook, his dedication to the  Sandia Heights community, and his  upbeat sense of humor, and we will  always remember his many contributions  to the betterment of the Sandia Heights  neighborhood. We offer our sincere  condolences to the Winokur family.

Pictures with Santa  were posted to a Picasa website for  downloading before Christmas. Projects  were worked on by kids at times if they had  to wait a bit to see Santa.

There  are some practical and low cost solutions for  avoiding the problems caused by frozen  pipes.  --Install insulated tape or heat tape  around exposed pipes.  These items are  available at most home improvement stores.  --Leave the water supply line on at a  very slow drip rate.  The cost of the water  used is insignificant compared to the cost of  repairing damage caused by a broken water  line.  --Install a hard foam protector on outside  water spigots.  --Make sure wall and attic insulation is  on the exterior side of a pipe so heat coming  from the ceiling or wall can reach it.  --For commercial buildings or vacant  homes, make sure there is adequate heat so  pipes don’t freeze.  Even when trying to  save energy costs, don’t turn the heat too far  down.                 Covenant Support Committee         The SHHA Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) has in our charter to “assist SHHA  members” resolving covenant complaints  and problems. Covenants are crucial to  Sandia Heights and some of the SHHA unit  covenants date back to the 1970s. If you  happened to look at the Albuquerque Journal  Business Outlook front page on December  13, 2010, you would have seen an article  about Ben Abruzzo and what he and others  built in NE Albuquerque at the base of the  Sandia Mountains. In the article it was stated  “Ben Abruzzo, who moved here in 1952,  and partner Robert Nordhaus worked with  contractor Gerald Martin to build Sandia  Peak Tramway in 1964-1966.  They  developed the ski area … and developed  Sandia Heights master-planned  community, a pioneer project in  xeriscaping, in the 1970s.”  Those of us  living in Sandia Heights today are fortunate  that Ben and Robert did such good work  planning for our residential neighborhood  and documented it well in the Unit  covenants. I seem to remember that just a  few years ago; Sandia Heights was named  by a national magazine or organization as  one of the top 10 neighborhoods in the US  in which to live. One of the reasons for this  accolade is that your Homeowners  association, SHHA, works with and for you  as an SHHA member homeowner, helping  you secure compliance with your Unit  covenants.         Since the SHHA annual meeting last  June, the CSC has helped member home  owners with resolution of over 20 Covenant  complaints. We still have about a half dozen  open Covenant complaints, including one  complaint by a Unit 7 member “about  annoyance and nuisance” resulting from  County Line Concerts. By the time you read  this article, which is being written in mid- January, 2010, you will have heard about the  Jan 29th meeting at the Church of Good  Shepherd with Commissioner Wiener & the  owner of County Line. If you receive and  read this GRIT before Tuesday, February 8,  2011, you are advised that there is a  Bernalillo County Commissioners meeting  at 5pm in the Vincent Griegos Chambers in  the Basement of the BC/ABQ city building  at 4th and Marquette. The subject of a  change to the BC Noise Ordinance will be  on the agenda.  If there are any last minute  time or agenda changes, they will be posted  on the SHHA website.       The SHHA Board will be supporting  member efforts regarding compliance with  Covenants and facilitating communications  with and among SHHA members regarding  the BC noise ordinance change hearing.    The GRIT, Feb 2011                                                                                                         Page 8  ACC Activity Log   The following is a summary of Approved  Projects activity since the last GRIT:   602 Cedar Hill Road – Patio Cover  711-21 Tramway Place - Canale Repair  987 Lynx Loop – Patio Cover  990 Lynx Loop – Garage Addition  1806 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence  1840 Tramway Terrace Loop - Fence  1905 Quail Run Loop – Landscaping  2428 Tramway Terrace Court – Paint Garage  Door  9101 Lynx Loop – Garage and Fence Addition  Check the ACC Project Log at the website  sandiahomeowners.org. Click on THE A.C.C.  then on Architectural Control Committee  Project Log and read about all projects  currently under ACC management.                 FROM THE ACC   If you are planning a home improvement  project this year and that project will change  the exterior appearance of your property,  remember that you must submit an application  to the ACC prior to starting the project. These  applications are not difficult to complete and  are available either at the SHHA office or  online at the SHHA Website. The ACC  encourages you to have the Committee look at  your project in the early planning stages to  check for covenant compliance. This is easy to  do--just call the SHHA office and make an  appointment to get on the ACC’s monthly  agenda (the ACC meets on the first and third  Wednesdays of every month at 1:00 PM).   Please take advantage of this service especially  if your project involves major remodeling or  substantial additions. A little “up-front”  planning will lessen the chances of  encountering problems with covenant  compliance once the project has started. The  ACC is here to help you all the way from start  to finish with your project. If you find that  changes need to be made to your project once  you have started construction, please  coordinate those changes with the ACC.   Again, the ACC will work with you and your  contractor to ensure that no covenant violations  will occur as a result of those changes.   If you happen to encounter an emergency  situation such as the repair of broken or  clogged water or sewer lines, repair or  replacement of septic systems, or other  situations where the urgency of the situation  requires quick action on your part in order to  prevent or minimize property damage, the ACC  does not want to stand in your way. You do not  need to submit an application for these sorts of  situations. Just let the SHHA office know that  you will be tending to an emergency situation  and, if applicable, that heavy equipment for  excavations may be required. This information  will help the office answer questions from your  neighbors who may be inquiring about what is  going on at your residence.  In the December 2010 edition of the GRIT,  a very timely and informative article was  published that was written by one of the local  home remodeling contractors who has been  very active for many years in the Albuquerque  area and is properly licensed and insured. The  importance of the information in this article  cannot be underestimated. Please read this  article carefully prior to choosing a contractor  for any of your remodeling projects. In this  time of a depressed economy, there are many  individuals looking for business and some of  these folks may not be properly licensed or  insured. You bear the risk of poor quality  workmanship and a host of other problems if  you choose to use an unlicensed and uninsured  contractor. That December GRIT article also  contains information on where to go (Web  sites, etc.) for more details on this subject.  Do  not be a victim of an unlicensed and uninsured  contractor!  From all of the members of the ACC, we  wish you a great 2011! Please remember that  the Committee is here to help you in any way it  can through all phases of your home  improvement projects.
