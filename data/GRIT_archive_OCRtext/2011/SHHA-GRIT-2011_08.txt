    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                    August 2011        President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry     Way to go, Sandia Heights!  We had a safe  and quiet Fourth of July weekend, thanks to  all of you who refrained from using  fireworks and were vigilant about keeping  fires from starting.  Sandia Heights Security  received only seven fireworks calls.  None  of those were for illegal fireworks but were  from folks who were concerned about  people using any kind of fireworks in our  dry environment.  Your sense of community  and the care you demonstrated to keep our  neighborhood safe are awesome!       The fire danger is still extreme, though,  and we need to stay on our toes.  I hope that  by the time you read this the monsoon rains  are well established and helping to alleviate  the painfully dry conditions.  Let’s continue  to work together and watch out for the safety  of our community.       The extreme drought, coupled with the  sub-zero temperatures in February and the  hard freeze in May, have created a crisis for  wildlife.  The May freeze killed most of the  blossoms of berry-producing plants, as well  as the oak blossoms that produce the acorns  that bears depend on to get through winter  hibernation, and the drought prevented the  usual spring and summer growth of  vegetation that other wildlife depends on.    Rabbits, rock squirrels, and chipmunks are  eating plants they normally don’t like (such  as my rabbit-resistant native plants!)  because their normal food isn’t there.   Predators like bobcats and coyotes are  suffering because the prey animals are less  plentiful.  What this means to us is that bears  may come into our neighborhood looking  for food, and normally elusive bobcats and  coyotes may become more bold and prey on  small pets.  The answer is not to trap and  relocate these animals, as recently happened  to a mother bobcat and her kitten.  Relocated  animals usually don’t survive, largely  because they are released in another  animal’s territory.  It’s up to us to work  together to keep from unwittingly attracting  animals that may become a problem because  of our actions.  Please keep your pets safe by  keeping cats indoors and not leaving dogs  unattended.   The tips for being bear-aware  that appeared in last month’s GRIT are  available on the SHHA website, or you can  pick up a hard copy in the office.  We are  also inaugurating a new feature on the  website, “Wild Neighbors”.  Each month we  will highlight one of the marvelous wild  creatures whose habitat we share, with  information about how to recognize them,  their habits and behavior, and situations and  solutions.  This month the focus is on  bobcats, one of the most amazing and  beautiful animals we are privileged to see in  Sandia Heights.       As part of our continuing effort to keep  you informed, here’s an update on the issues  surrounding the outdoor concerts at the  County Line Restaurant.  At SHHA’s  insistence, Bernalillo County has been  monitoring the decibel level at the concerts  and has issued at least one notice of  violation of the County noise ordinance to  the County Line.  Remedies available to the  County include court action.

I hope your summer continues to be safe  and enjoyable.  Thank you again for  everything you do to help keep Sandia  Heights the unique and beautiful and  desirable “peak of living” that it is.                SHHA member benefits            Your SHHA member benefits and  services include: office and notary services,  annual classified ads, Coffeehouse Concert  Series, Sandia Tram passes, tree lottery,  covenant enforcement, no-fee ACC  applications, and discounted safety vests.

All that  is needed is for the property owner to  maintain membership in SHHA. Many  property owners mistakenly believe that if  they move from Sandia Heights and rent  their house to another family, they must  cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be  collected as part of the monthly utility bill  for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to  the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible  for all SHHA membership benefits except  voting privileges and filing covenant  violation complaints. Tram passes are  among the most popular member benefits,  so be sure you maintain your membership so  your tenants can experience some of the  great “perks” of living in Sandia Heights!                   No Soliciting         Are solicitors bothering  you? Solicitors in Albuquerque  are forbidden by law to knock on any door  where a sign is posted, clearly stating that  solicitors are not welcome. Such signs  should include the words: “No Trespassing,”  or “No Peddlers,” or “No advertisements” or  “No Soliciting.”  The "no trespassing" is especially important  in addition to the "no solicitation," security  officers can then ask the solicitor to leave  private property. Signs should be posted  where they can be seen from the roadway.                 The GRIT, August 2011                                                                                                          Page 3             FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT  CANCELLED          The Movie Night was cancelled because  of poor air quality.

It was written by  Jessica Speck of JADE Enterprises, Inc, a  local general contractor with many years of  experience in the Albuquerque area.  It is  worth publishing again since the ACC  continues to hear “horror stories” of  residents being taken advantage of by  unlicensed and uninsured contractors.   Know who you are dealing with and take  advantage of the information contained in  this article!  Sincerely, Bob Bower,  Chairman, ACC.     Hire Licensed and Insured  Contractors!  By Jessica Speck           Contracting without a license in the state  New Mexico is against the law. With  setbacks in our current economic conditions,  we are all cutting corners with our spending.   Many homeowners are choosing to remodel  their current homes as opposed to  purchasing new homes, which is wonderful.  But in order to save a little money, they are  choosing to hire inexperienced, unlicensed,  uninsured individuals often becoming a  sizeable liability to the homeowner and the  completed home project. While it seems  reasonable to spend less and find any cost  deals available, this approach has devastated  the home-remodeling industry.       Recently there has been a rise of  unlicensed individuals entering the home- remodeling market with a set of tools, a  truck and minor remodeling skills who have  begun delivering bids to the homeowner at  prices too good to be true!  Remember the  old adage:  “You get what you pay for”, it  still carries great validity, even in the home- remodeling industry.  Low-quality material  and workmanship often go unnoticed for  months or even years often times resulting  in the cost of demolition of the poor  workmanship and paying again for a  licensed contractor to build what the “Scope  of Work” actually called for.  Unfortunately  however, no insurance is one of the most  obvious and devastating ways construction  costs are cut.  This means that if anyone  should fall off the homeowner’s roof, use  faulty materials and methods, or damage the  homeowner’s home or belongings, there is  no coverage to protect the homeowner. In  these circumstances, the unlicensed or  uninsured remodeler cannot afford to pay for  the damages leaving the homeowner with an  uncompleted project and large mistakes to  pay for.    This can be related to the liability  incurred when we get in a car accident with  an individual who has failed to purchase car  insurance. Who then pays for your personal  injuries, or damages to your car and their  car? You or your insurance company will  then be responsible for the damages.       If you have been a victim of unlicensed  contracting or you would like more  information on the topic, you can visit the  New Mexico Regulation and Licensing  department’s “Construction Industries  Division” Web site at:   www.rld.state.nm.us/CID/unlicensed.htm    Note:  When hiring a contractor look for  license #, Liability Coverage and Workers  Compensation. You may also request a  Builders Risk Policy be taken out on your  project.                   SECURTY ALERT  The office has a  security email alert that can be emailed to all  of those people whose email addresses are in  our database.
