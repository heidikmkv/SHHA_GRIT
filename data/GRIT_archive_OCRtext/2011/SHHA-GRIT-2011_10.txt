    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                              October 2011        President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry               Several things are on my mind this  month, all having to do with “the power of  one”.  With so many challenges in the  world, our country, and our community, it is  natural to get discouraged and think “What  difference can I make?  I am just one  person”. But that is exactly the point. One  person alone probably cannot make much  difference, but one person working with and  teaming up with one person at a time begins  to add up to a lot of people. We can make a  difference, starting in our own community.         Bears in Sandia Heights:  We have been  working hard to get the word out about the  plight of our Sandia bears, and we  appreciate very much your support and your  efforts to reduce conflicts with our bears.   As you know, the drought and the late  spring freeze wiped out the bears’ natural  food sources on the east side of the Sandias,  so the bears must come to the west side of  the mountains where there is still adequate  natural forage (acorns, juniper berries, piñon  nuts, and cactus fruit). Everyone I have  talked to is sympathetic to the bears’  predicament and committed to keeping  garbage inside and bird feeders put away so  the bears can eat their natural foods without  getting into trouble. But some folks have not  gotten the word, as we still see garbage set  out the night before pickup day. So, a plea to  the majority of you who understand the  situation:  please talk to your neighbors and  educate them, one person at a time.   Reassure them that the bears will not bother  them if they do not bother the bears, and that  they do not need to call Game and Fish  unless they have a dire situation, like a bear  breaking into their house. If each of you  talks to one person, that is a lot of people  who will be more “bear aware”. Our small  population of 50 or so Sandia mountain  bears is dwindling fast—Game and Fish has  already killed or removed 19 bears from the  Albuquerque area alone this year. All of us  working together, one person at a time, can  help save the bears that remain.         Covenant Enforcement:   Frequently we  get calls from SHHA members with  complaints about covenant violations in  their neighborhoods. When we explain that  in order for the Covenant Support  Committee to act on the violation the  member must submit a written complaint,  they often decline, saying they “do not want  to be a bad neighbor”.  In reality, the  opposite is true—you are actually being a  bad neighbor if you do not submit a  complaint. Here’s why.  SHHA and the CSC  do not patrol Sandia Heights looking for  covenant violations. We can only investigate  and resolve a covenant violation if a  neighbor files a written complaint. We  depend on SHHA members, one person at a  time, to help enforce the covenants. If you  see a covenant violation and you ignore it,  you are in effect saying that the covenants  are not important.                                        Continued on page 2  The GRIT, October 2011                                                                                                    Page 2    Continued from front page         I know this is not true—the results of a  survey a few years ago showed that the vast  majority of Sandia Heights residents  considered the covenants and covenant  enforcement to be very important. So be a  good neighbor:  report covenant violations  so the CSC can resolve them, and help  preserve the beauty and desirability of  Sandia Heights.         Recycling:  The recycling program has  been quite successful, so much so that  Sandia Heights Services has been providing  the service free of charge for several  months. Our community’s participation in  the recycling program is a great example of  how we can reduce waste and protect our  environment, one person at a time. Every  item recycled instead of tossed in the trash  avoids overburdening landfills, saves  resources, prevents pollution, and creates  jobs. At this time recyclable materials are  picked up every other week. If we can  increase our participation (currently at 50%)  we will be able to offer curbside recycling  every week. We can boost our participation  by discussing the benefits of recycling with  our neighbors, one person at a time. Check  out “Why Everyone Should Recycle” on our  website under “News and Information”, or  pick up a copy in the office.       One person at a time we can each make  a difference in Sandia Heights!                    SHHA Meet ‘N’ Greet  SATURDAY, October 15, 2011   9a.m. to 11a.m.   at the Church of the Good Shepherd    This is a don’t miss event!       Dr. Richard E. Peck is an author,  playwright and retired academic, whose  writing career – detoured for years –  resumed when he left the academic  environment.  After a career as an English  professor and university administrator –  president at one time or another of three  universities – he now divides his time  among three very satisfying pursuits:  restrained meddling in the lives of his  children and grandchildren, golfing at a  level far below his aspirations, and writing.       Dr. Peck continues to resist persistent but  fading desires to return to the classroom.  Occasional consulting stints remind him of  the political pressures he’s traded away in  order to take on the even more demanding  but self-imposed goals and deadlines of full- time writing. He did manage to complete 12  produced plays (three of them winners in  national competitions), a score of short  stories, a novel nominated as Best Science  Fiction Novel of the Year (Final Solution,  Doubleday), and TV scripts, as well as two  editions of minor poetry.        We guarantee entertainment, food, fun,  and great door prizes. Please RSVP by  calling the office at 797-7793 by Friday,  October 7.                  NO SOLICITORS!                 Are solicitors bothering  you?  Solicitors in  Albuquerque are forbidden  by law to knock on any door where a sign is  posted, clearly stating that solicitors are not  welcome. Such signs should include the  words: “No Trespassing,” or “No Peddlers,”  or “No advertisements” or “No Soliciting.”       The "no trespassing" is especially  important in addition to the "no solicitation,"  security officers can then ask the solicitor to  leave private property. Remember virtually  all of Sandia Heights is County roadways  and there is no County ordinance that can  keep them off of the roadways. Signs should  be posted where they can be seen from the  roadway.

If you are planning a home improvement  project that will change the exterior  appearance of your property, you are  required by your Unit covenants to submit  an application to the ACC whether or not  you are a member of the SHHA.  The  application forms are not difficult to fill out  and are available at the SHHA office or  online via the SHHA website  (sandiahomeowners.org).  Make sure that  the application is complete—if you are not  sure how to fill it out, the office staff will  provide assistance.  Remember that for re- roofing, re-stuccoing, and repainting  projects, even if the new roof and colors will  match the existing ones, you still must  submit an application so the ACC and your  neighbors know what is going on at your  home when the contractors arrive.   Approvals for these types of projects can  normally be done within a few days.       For projects such as new home  construction, major additions and/or  modifications, walls and fences, and large  landscaping efforts, the review process may  take several weeks, especially if a  neighborhood review (these take about 10  days or so) is required.  If your project is  like one of these, please take extra care to  see that the ACC gets the information it  needs and that you are available to meet  with the ACC member assigned to monitor  the project.  These projects usually require a  plot plan showing the location of your  existing home and of the proposed  additions/modifications relative to your  property lines. The plot plan you received  with your property deed is a good starting  point.  If you don’t have one, the ACC may  have one on file or, if not, the County has  the plan as part of its records for your  property.       The ACC encourages you to have the  Committee conduct an informal review of  your project in the early planning stages to  check for covenant compliance.  The ACC  meets the first and third Wednesdays of  every month at 1:00 PM and if you want the  Committee to review your preliminary  plans, just call the SHHA office and  schedule an appointment to meet with the  Committee at one of these regularly  scheduled times. We will advise you of any  problems or issues with the preliminary  plans so you can make the appropriate  changes prior to the formal submission of  the final (and much more expensive) plans.   Once the ACC approves the final plans,  keep the ACC fully informed if you make  any changes to these plans regardless of how  trivial you may think these changes are.   Such items as changing designs of chimneys  or relocating an air conditioning unit from a  ground-mounted location to a roof-mounted  location or vice-versa need to be approved  by the ACC if these changes are not part of  the originally approved plans.       Continued on page 8    The GRIT, October 2011                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7         As a final reminder, please keep in mind  that starting a project before you receive  ACC approval is a violation of your  covenants and puts you and your contractor at  risk if the Committee is unable to approve all  or part or your project.  A little advance  planning and discipline on the part of you and  your contractors will go a long way to assist  you through all phases of your project and to  enhance your ultimate enjoyment of it!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   37 Cedar Hill Place – Reroof & Window  Replacement  155 Juniper Hill Road – Landscaping & Wall  185 Big Horn Ridge Circle – Carport Enclosure  319 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Reroof  657 Roadrunner Lane – Refinish Garage Door  Trim & Patio Area  684 Black Hawk Drive – Parapet Repair  748 Tramway Lane – Fence Replacement  807 Tramway Lane – Re-roof & Gutters  901 Tramway Lane – Refinish Trim  1065 Red Oaks Loop – Garage Door  Replacement  1145 Marigold Drive – Recoat Stucco  1164 Laurel Loop – Remodel & Addition  1550 Eagle Ridge Lane – Landscaping  1862 Tramway Terrace Loop – Paint Trim  1945 Quail Run Loop – Window & Door  Replacement  2307 Calle de Rafael – Window Replacement  2448 Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof  2727 Tramway Circle – Restucco & Trim  2753 Wolfberry Place – Paint Stucco  2756 Cliffrose Drive – Window Replacement  2878 Brushwood St. – Window Replacement  7707 Cedar Canyon – Window & Door  Replacement  7726 Cedar Canyon – Restucco  8218 Raintree Drive – Gutter Installation  8219 Raintree Drive – Gate  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management        z  zz  zz  zz  z      ELECTRONIC ARCHIVING  OF ACC DOCUMENTS         Earlier this year, the ACC office staff  completed the monumental task of  electronically archiving all of the residential  files including the large format rolled plans.   This effort saved the community over  $15,000 in lieu of hiring an outside source  to accomplish this task. Details of this effort  were explained in the May, 2011 edition of  the GRIT. The ACC is now in the process  of returning all of the large format plans to  respective property owners of record. A  letter will be sent to all property owners  who have not yet  retrieved these plans.  If these plans are not  picked up at the  SHHA office by 31  January, 2012, they  are scheduled to be  destroyed.     Advertisements do not represent an endorsement by SHHA.
