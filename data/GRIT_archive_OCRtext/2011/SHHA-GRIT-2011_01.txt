Meet  and Greet with Santa was a huge success  which truly demonstrated all the heartfelt  giving of our board members and volunteers  working together to make this a success for  our SHHA community. This too validates  that our community demographics are  changing and we welcome and embrace that  change within our community.  A special thanks to Sandra Brown for the  idea and Ana Acosta for stepping up and  organizing and having a vision to create this  special day. Despite the wind, nearly 70  children accompanied by their parents and  grandparents attended the first Meet and  Greet with Santa. A big thank you too is in  order for Burt O’Neil and Kerney Bolton for  taking all of the photos of the children with  Santa. Oh yes, the Santa Elves and Santa  Helpers were key in helping Santa visit with     Continued on page 2    The GRIT, Jan 2011                                                                                                            Page 2  Continued from front page    all the boys and girls. We also want to  extend a special appreciation to Linda  Bolton for the challenging task of  scheduling Santa Claus to stop by our  neighborhood during his busiest season.  Again, a special thanks to all who helped  and supported this effort.  Also as a result of  this day, our Roadrunner food bank  containers are overflowing, again thanks to  all of you. This is just another indication of  our caring community.  The evening of December 7th we  conducted a special meeting of Units South  6, 7, 27, 28 and North 1, 2 and 3 regarding  the County Line outdoor concert noise issue  and proposed noise ordinance change.  It  was extremely valuable to hear first hand  from each of you regarding your experience  with the outdoor concerts to date.  Now we  can take your ideas forward to our attorney  as we work this issue.  Again, thank you for  your attendance and participation and we  will continue to keep you informed as we  work this issue in the near future.  We will  continue to update our website and notify  you by mail and email of any future  meetings and updates in the GRIT.  Another SHHA team also is working  hard on the Waste water and Septic Tank  project.    Several meetings have been conducted  in December and we will be keeping you  informed as details start to take form.  Again  watch our website and GRIT for future  updates.                           Happy New Year from your Board of  Directors and the office staff.                REYCYCLING IN SANDIA  HEIGHTS:    Sandia Heights  Services (SHS) is  providing our  community with  curbside recycling.  It started as a pilot  program but due to  enthusiastic  customer response, it is now part of the  standard service waste management of all  Sandia Heights customers. There is no  separate fee because it is included in the  Sandia Services monthly bill. To date there  are hundreds of households participating and  this has saved 30 truckloads (175,540  pounds) of recyclables from being dumped  in the landfill.  Go to http://sandiaheightsservices.com  and click on the “Sanitation” tab. At the  bottom of that page you will find  information on the program as well as links  to the recycling calendar for your  neighborhood. The site also tells you what  items: plastics, papers, aluminum, and the  like, are included and which are not:  Styrofoam and glass, due to its sharp edges.  You may put the recyclables in a clear  plastic bag but SHS will also pick up any  clearly marked regular plastic bag. Or, you  can put items in a large plastic garbage gin  marked for recyclables.

Trees cut since this  year’s SHHA Annual Meeting, June 12th,  2010 are eligible for a drawing at next  June’s Annual Meeting.        Eighty-nine percent of our residents have  stated that they were either very or  somewhat concerned with undue obstruction  of views by trees.* Now is the time to act on  our convictions and do our part to curtail,  reduce, and reverse the otherwise relentless  advance of trees into our distant mountain  and valley views.

Lights For Life is a nonprofit  organization that strives to make life easier  for kids with cancer and their families.  Lights For Life sells the donated light  strands to a recycling company for the  copper and PVC they contain. The money  raised is used to help children with cancer  and their families cover the cost of medical  bills and other expenses not covered by  insurance, as well as to fund kids' camps and  childhood cancer research.   Last year, Ace Hardware customers  across Colorado, Wyoming and New  Mexico donated 14 tons of holiday lights to  the campaign, raising $14,000 for families  of children diagnosed with cancer. This  year, Ace Hardware's goal is to increase the  number of lights collected by 50 percent, for  a total of 21 tons of lights.  According to Consumer Reports, a  typical homeowner spends approximately  $11 in energy costs to burn 50 feet of  traditional lights for 300 hours, while the  same use of LED lights costs less than 15  cents. LED lights are also more durable than  incandescent lights, often lasting as much as  ten times longer than traditional lights, and  because LED lights burn cooler they are  safer to use and reduce the risk of fire.  “Each year, more than 200 million  strings of incandescent lights are sold in the  U.S., and most of them end up in the  landfill,” said Linda Worthington, marketing  director Lights For Life. “All we ask is that  you drop your broken or old lights in a  collection bin at an Ace Hardware rather  than in the Dumpster. This small effort can  make a big difference to kids with cancer.”  The holiday light recycling program  adds to the growing list recycling programs  offered by area Ace Hardware stores. Many  Ace Hardware stores also accept used  compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs),  mercury-containing thermostats, used cell  phones and rechargeable batteries for  recycling  Holiday string lights can be donated to  participating Ace Hardwares in Colorado,  Wyoming, and New Mexico between  November 1st and February 15th.                 TRAM Passes    SHHA has purchased 6 corporate tram  passes per day!
