We had a great  turnout for the meeting and for the Town  Hall Meeting that followed, with 76  households attending. Your Board of  Directors and committee volunteers worked  hard to put the meeting together, and  everything went off without a hitch. I think  everyone was impressed by the hard work of  the dedicated Board and committee  volunteers and by how much we have  accomplished this year. We really appreciate  your concern and support for our community  that you demonstrated by attending the  meeting. Special thanks go to our incredible  office staff, Betsy and Sheraz, who  organized the Annual Meeting and made  sure everything went smoothly. Their  professionalism and dedication are  unmatched, and we would be lost without  them. They are the “face” of SHHA, and I  am sure you know they are happy to assist  you in any way they can and to answer your  questions.       I am pleased to introduce your new  officers for 2011-2012.  I am honored to  continue as President, and former president  Andy Anderson will serve as your Vice  President.  Andy also chairs the Covenant  Support Committee. Michele Munson has  agreed to serve as Secretary for another  year. Dick Wavrik has been an active  committee volunteer and board member for  the past three years and will serve as  Treasurer and chair of the Finance  Committee. We had no new board members  nominated for confirmation at the Annual  Meeting, but we expect to confirm  additional directors at the July board  meeting.     We are losing five board members this  year. Jon Cashwell served on the Board this  past year and was a member of the Covenant  Support Committee. Bruce Childs was  active on the Board since 2008 and served  on the Communications and Publications  Committee and the Community Service and  Membership Committee. Your past  president Phyllis Moore ably served the  community as a board member since 2008  and also served as Vice President. She was  also a longtime volunteer on the Community  Service and Membership Committee. Under  her leadership, SHHA was able to bring  several new benefits to our members and to  the community.

Ed also  served as chair of the Finance Committee.  Sadly, as you know, Mike Winokur passed  away in December. Mike was an active  board member since 2006 and was a  member of the Architectural Control  Committee as well as chair of the  Community Service and Membership  Committee. We will miss all of them, and I  extend my sincere thanks for their service to  SHHA and to the Sandia Heights  community.       Your Association exists to support you,  the members, and to uphold the standards  that make Sandia Heights such a unique and  beautiful community. But we need your  help! Please consider volunteering for one of  our committees or for the Board.

May 17, 2011 from  Bernalillo County.   Hello neighborhood leaders,   For those of you that are following the  Noise Ordinance, there is some  confusion regarding the minutes of last  Tuesday's BCC meeting that are posted  on the web. The minutes reflect that the  action taken was a deferral. This is  INCORRECT, the motion was indeed to  table this agenda item. Our IT  department is working on this correction.  Thanks for your patience!      Bernadette Miera , Neighborhood  Program Coordinator, Public  Information Department  (Note from George Connor, SHHA  Special Task Force for County Line  noise nuisance: I talked with  Commissioner Wiener’s Assistant,  Darrell Dady, the evening of May 17th  and he confirmed the above information  as coming through him from  Commissioner Wiener.  Darrell also  committed that it is Commissioner  Wiener’s intention to table the noise  amendment for “a long time”.  Having  been a computer programmer before  retirement, I understand about new  computer software specification errors  and that is exactly what this appears to  me to be – not a conspiracy to put the  noise ordinance on the June agenda  when people are on vacation and no  opposing speakers are at the  Commission meeting.  We in SHHA will  look at the website and BCC agenda the  1st week in June and update this web  posting if anything has changed.)--    Nothing has changed and the noise  ordinance amendment is not on the June  14th BCC meeting agenda.      *********************************  EMAIL sent from SHHA to Bernalillo  County officials on Thursday, May 12,  2011, regarding enforcement of Noise  Ordinance at County Line Concerts    TO: County Manager Zdunek -   My name is George Connor and I am a  Board Member of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA).   I  am also responsible for Covenant  Violations regarding nuisance and  annoyance activities in SHHA South  Unit 7, in which the County Line is  located.  I saw at the Tuesday BC  Commissioners meeting that you were  tasked to work out noise enforcement  efforts with Environmental Health  manager Mr. Schroeder.   We in Sandia  Heights appreciate you working on  enforcement of the BC Noise  Ordinance.         We observed that a notice was posted  on the Albuquerque NM County Line  website last night or this morning  announcing their 1st spring  concert.  Details about the concert and  performance are on the web  at    http://www.countyline.com/Albuquer queMusic.html        SHHA has been discussing with  County Line owner, Mr Miller, during  the last month or so, ways he can  mitigate the annoyances caused by  traffic, illegal parking, litter, and fire  danger when he sponsors the Thursday  night Concerts.  However, we are  depending on Bernalillo County  The GRIT, July 2011                                                                                           Insert Page  personnel to enforce the Noise  Ordinance, whether it is the one we  have had for 40 years or a new Amended  Noise Ordinance we might have in the  future.

UNMH is the  state’s only Level 1 care center, treating  New Mexico’s most serious illness and  injury. In addition, it has the only  dedicated pediatric emergency room, the  only pediatric infusion center and a  nationally designated cancer center.  UNMH is also home to 13 pediatric  subspecialties, offering the highest level  of intensive care for children and  premature infants in the state.      In 1954, the University of New  Mexico Hospitals became operational as  the Bernalillo County Indian Hospital. In  the early 60s the UNM School of  Medicine began its collaboration with  the hospital as a teaching facility. The  hospital’s name change to Bernalillo  County Medical Center in 1968  stemmed from its growth in scope of  services. The University of New Mexico  began operating the hospital in 1969 as  result of a joint powers agreement  between the UNM Regents and the  Bernalillo County Commissioners, and  began using the facility as a teaching  hospital. In 1979 the name was changed,  in conjunction with the hospital’s 25th  anniversary, to The University of New  Mexico Hospital.      In following years, the hospital would  continually increase its services, widen  its continuum of care, and eventually be  a specialty destination in statewide  healthcare. In 1994 the University of  New Mexico Health Sciences Center  was established as the largest academic  health complex in the state. Located on  the University of New Mexico north  campus, the HSC combines four mission  areas - education, research, patient care  and partnership - to provide New  Mexicans with the highest level of health  care.       As an organization, UNMH strives to  keep community members well informed  about new and existing services  available at UNMH, and various  programs, initiatives, finances and  statistics as well. UNMH wants the  community to know how we are working  to better serve you and your families. If  you would like more information or  know of a group that would be interested  in becoming more informed about UNM  Hospitals, please contact me at  mpsalaz@salud.unm.edu or 272-4388.  This presentation is not aimed at  acquiring new patients; rather, it's geared  toward informing the community about  what happens at UNMH, and what  services your funding provides.   Thank you very much!    The GRIT, July 2011                                                                                                             Page 7  Continued page 3     Here is some information that will help  clear up this issue.       One restriction that appears in every  single one of the Sandia Heights Unit  Covenants states that “No Chinese elms,  cotton-bearing cottonwood trees, or  Bermuda grass shall be maintained on any  lot”. The nomenclature in the Covenants is  incorrect: Siberian elms are often mistakenly  called Chinese elms, but true Chinese elms  (Ulmus parvifolia) almost never appear in  New Mexico. Therefore, SHHA has  consistently applied this restriction to the  Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila).       Siberian elms were planted by the  thousands in Albuquerque during the 1930s,  and have since become invasive. Despite the  large number of Siberian elms in the city,  they do not make very good ornamental  trees, as they are fairly short-lived, have  brittle wood, and usually look pretty ragged  after several years. They certainly do not  belong in the native foothills vegetation in  Sandia Heights. But they are extremely  energetic when young and resistant to  drought and severe cold, which is why they  are so difficult to get rid of. Young trees  must be dug out by the roots, and larger tree  stumps must be treated with a systemic  herbicide after the tree is cut down. If the  tree is simply cut, it will sprout many  vigorous shoots from the stump. It is best to  remove them when they are very small.    Bernalillo County will remove elm trees  from the County right-of-way at the front of  your property if you request it. You may call  848-1503 to submit a work order. For elm  trees elsewhere on your property, we invite  you to have them removed and then submit  the invoice to the Tree Lottery. Information  about the tree lottery can be found on the  SHHA website  www:sandiahomeowners.org.

This is also when  the mama bears kick out the  2-year-olds, who then have to find their own  territory. These young bears often wander  into our neighborhood because they  remember where they have found easy food.  Here is what you can do to keep bears from  becoming habituated and thus becoming  problem bears:  ¾ Keep all garbage in your garage or a  sturdy shed.  ¾ Put garbage out only on the morning of  your trash pickup day.    ¾ Do not leave pet food outside.  ¾ Bring hummingbird feeders inside at  dusk (and take them inside for the winter  in October).  ¾ Fill bird feeders with only enough seed  to last half the day (better yet, don’t feed  the birds at all for a while).  ¾ If you have fruit trees: pick fruit as it  ripens, and keep fallen fruit picked up.

These containers provide  on-site secure storage for personal items and  are not to be confused with the large dumpsters  that are sometimes used during construction for  temporary storage and removal of trash and  debris associated with the construction  activities. In most cases, the secure storage  container or containers are located in the front  portion of the property where they are being  used, usually in association with some form of  short-term home remodeling or repair activities  when contents such as furniture, etc., need to be  temporarily removed from the home during the  remodeling.  Along with the increased use of  these containers within Sandia Heights comes,  as expected, an increase in complaints from  residents who can see them from their  respective properties.  When applying to the  ACC for additions or remodels to the exterior  of a residence, the application form should state  whether or not one or more of these secure  storage containers will be used in conjunction  with the construction.  The ACC will modify  the current application form to include this  information.  The intent is not to deny the  usage of the containers but to understand  exactly how long the containers will be located  on the property and to be able to address  neighborhood complaints.  If the ACC  determines that the containers have exceeded  the timelines for expected usage on the  property as stated in the original ACC  application, the owner will be contacted to  either modify the application or to have the  containers removed.  In the event that one or  more of these secure storage containers are  needed for interior modifications that are not  subject to prior ACC approval, property owners  are asked to notify the SHHA office staff of the  presence of the containers.  Complaints  regarding these containers will be handled by  the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) since  ACC approval and involvement are not  required for home modifications that do not  affect the exterior appearance of the home.      z  zz  zz  zz  z  Don’t replace it  REFACE IT  A  (CABINET REFACING  FAST install Most jobs completed RORPERENDS MARCH SY 2011 ‘within 2 to 5 days S7;SODInstant Factory Rebate ff [une esrtthar  Monte ci Tattoo oot Wo IETEREST - NO PAYMENTS 702-8789 5504 Menaul NE Forte MONTHS or  LOW MONTHLY PAYMENTS. ist onr beg th Call Today for a FREE InHome  5504 Menaul NE Consitation BB1-3 cl Toy oa RE tae  | Moving.
