The Holidays can be difficult for many New  Mexicans with more than 20% of the  population living in poverty. Food drives  enable the food bank to provide a wide  variety of high quality, nutritious food items  throughout the year. The Roadrunner Food  Bank of New Mexico distributes more than  22 million pounds of food a year to  hundreds of nonprofit agencies throughout  New Mexico. Each one of us can make an  impact.        Please help by bringing non-perishable  food items to the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association office located at  San Rafael and Tramway. Office hours are  Monday through Friday 9am-4pm. Look for  the big red drop box inside.        Most Needed Items:  Macaroni & Cheese, Canned Fruits, Canned  Vegetables, Canned Meats, Canned Entrees,  Cereal Bars, Rice, Sugar, Pastas, Soups,  Baby Food, Boxed Meals. Plastic, boxed,  bagged and canned containers present less  chance of breakage and less loss of good  food.     MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR  YOUR GENEROSITY.!              President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry     With the holiday season upon us, I thought  it would be a good idea to review some  security and safety tips. While we are very  fortunate in Sandia Heights to have one of  the lowest crime rates in the city, we have  still had our share of mail theft and  residential burglaries. The best security  system is not necessarily an alarm system in  your house, but the eyes and ears of each of  us and our neighbors. Constant awareness  and vigilance by our residents, and the  willingness of every one of us to become  involved in looking out for the well-being of  our neighbors, are the keys to maintaining  the safety and security of Sandia Heights.                                            Continued on page 2    The GRIT, December 2011                                                                                                    Page 2  Continued from front page     To borrow from the Department of  Homeland Security’s campaign, “See  Something, Say Something”, it wouldn’t  hurt for us to be on the nosy side when it  comes to unusual happenings in our  neighborhoods.  If you see something that  doesn’t look right—activity at your  neighbor’s house when they aren’t home or  suspicious vehicles in your area—call the  Sandia Heights Security Patrol Officer at  263-4654 (if you subscribe to the security  service), or the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s  Department (798-7000).  If you see someone  breaking into your neighbor’s house, or for  any emergency, call 911.     The most effective security strategy is to  establish trusted relationships with your  neighbors. Agree to watch out for each other  and report any suspicious activity in and  around your homes. Remember, residential  burglaries statistically occur during the day,  so if possible, identify trusted neighbors  who might be home during this time. A  home security system is a good deterrent for  burglars, but it can give you a false sense of  security. Even if they set off your alarm,  burglars can be in and out of your house  within a couple of minutes and steal  televisions, computers, and jewelry before  law enforcement personnel can respond.   Again, “nosy neighbors” are your best  defense. Keep doors and windows locked.   Many of the burglaries reported recently by  Sandia Heights Security were from unlocked  cars and garages with open doors, and  burglars love to slip into your house through  an unlocked door or window.       Don’t leave mail in your mailbox  overnight. If you have bills to pay or  greeting cards that include checks or gift  cards, don’t leave them in your mailbox for  the mail carrier to pick up—take them to a  post office. Mail thieves look for easy  pickings provided by careless homeowners,  especially during the season of gift-giving.    In keeping with the philosophy of neighbors  looking out for each other, Neighborhood  Watch programs have proven to be very  effective.  If you’d like to set one up, you  can view the Neighborhood Watch  guidelines by clicking on the link at  http://www.bernco.gov/neighborhood- watch-program-216111/ .  For a starter  packet, or if you have questions about the  program, you can contact Bernadette Miera  with Bernalillo County Neighborhood  Coordination at 468-1279.     The SHHA Board of Directors and our  office staff all wish you the happiest and  safest of holidays!               Last chance for  Four Seasons  Tennis Club       The courts will close  as of December 31 so come and get your  free tennis passes at the SHHA office for  Association members, their families, and  house guests.

Our dedicated volunteers, many of whom  have experience and expertise in  environmental science and engineering,  have been studying State and local  regulations governing residential septic  systems. The primary focus has been on the  Bernalillo County ordinance which required  that all septic systems be upgraded by  January 2015. These upgrades could be very  expensive for the average homeowner in  Sandia Heights.     Primarily due to the efforts of the  Committee, and with the support of  Commissioner Michael Wiener, the  Bernalillo County Commission voted to  rescind the portion of the ordinance that  required all septic systems to be upgraded  by January 2015. This is a huge  accomplishment, and the Committee has  done a great service to Sandia Heights.

The Committee is continuing to work  with State and County officials to make sure  Sandia Heights is not unfairly affected by  upgrade requirements.      The best way to insure that your septic  system functions properly is to maintain it  conscientiously: conserve water so as not to  overload the system; have the tank pumped  and inspected regularly; and be careful not  to dispose of harmful substances in the  septic system. Guidelines for septic tank  pumping frequency vary, but many people  consider the couple of hundred dollars spent  having the tank pumped every year to be  money well spent—it’s a fairly inexpensive  way to ensure your system is working as it  should.  A properly maintained septic  system can last for many years. For more  information on taking care of your septic  system, please check out “A Homeowner’s  Guide to Septic Systems” published by the  US Environmental Protection Agency, on  the SHHA website:  http://www.epa.gov/owm/septic/pubs/homeo wner_guide_long.pdf.

I heard several  “tales of woe” last year and I thought I’d get  the word out earlier this year with some tips  on how to avoid frozen water pipes.        Disconnecting water hoses and protecting  the outdoor faucets are very important.  Water that freezes in hoses causes a buildup  of pressure on interior plumbing that can  result in a rupture of the interior pipes if the  pressure is too high.  Damage to these pipes  near a water faucet is often difficult to repair  due to the inaccessibility of these pipes.  Disconnecting hoses from these faucets and  protecting the faucets with hard foam  insulating cups are good ways to reduce the  chances of damage to these pipes that extend  through exterior walls. These foam  insulating cups can be purchased at home  improvement stores. Also, if you have any  water pipes that are located outside your  home that are exposed to the outside  temperatures, you may want to consider  using insulating tape or heat tape around  these exposed pipes.       Now, let’s consider the inside of your  home. If Albuquerque experiences a spell of  extremely cold temperatures, leave the water  supply line on at a very slow drip rate  somewhere inside your home. Normally, a  faucet located far away from where the  water enters your home is the one that you  should use for this purpose. The cost of  water used is insignificant compared to the  cost of repairing damage caused by a broken  water line inside your home.  If you are  away from your home during the cold  season, make sure that there is adequate heat  inside your home to prevent pipes from  freezing.  Even when trying to save energy  costs, don’t turn the heat too far down and  don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you  have all of the water lines properly drained.              SECURITY ALERT               The office has a security email alert  system by which SHHA can send notices to  people whose email addresses are in our  database.

With these tasks completed, the staff is  proceeding with the disposal of all of the hard  copy files and have notified all homeowners to  retrieve the large format plans by January of  2012.      Beginning in January of 2012, the ACC  application form will be amended to require  one hard copy and one in digital format with  submittals of the applications. The SHHA  office is willing to assist those homeowners  with these new requirements and in some cases  may waive the requirement for the electronic  copy if it makes no sense to submit the  documents in the electronic format due to the  simplicity of the project.
