    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                             November 2011        President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry         During the past several months I have  had the pleasure of talking to SHHA  members about many topics.  No matter  what the subject matter, the underlying  message I hear is how much people  appreciate the beauty of our community and  our scenic views, the way our lots and  streets are laid out to preserve the natural  character of the foothills landscape, and the  pleasure of being able to see bobcats,  coyotes, deer, and bears in our own back  yards.  Our community is truly unique, and  we all have our own ideas about the best  way to maintain the exceptional character of  Sandia Heights that makes it one of the most  desirable neighborhoods in the Albuquerque  metro area.         The decisions on how to maintain the  unique character of Sandia Heights rest with  SHHA members and your participation in  the process.  Your Board of Directors is  made up of a small number of volunteers  who care deeply about our community and  dedicate their time and energy to  maintaining “the peak of living” that we  enjoy.  We have several active committees  made up of Board members and volunteers.   These committees are vital to getting the  work of SHHA done—not only by providing  the wonderful services and benefits that our  members partake of, but also by establishing  the positions and priorities of the  Association and by bringing issues to the  Board.  We need your support on these  committees and on the Board to keep the  Association running.  We are fortunate to  have Board members with a variety of  backgrounds and skills, and right now we  have several open positions.  We need new  Board members who have good ideas and  are able to devote the time necessary to be  active, productive participants.  We also  need volunteers for the Covenant Support  Committee, the Communications and  Publications Committee, and the  Community Service and Membership  Committee.  You do not need to be a  member of the Board to serve on these  committees.  If you are interested in serving  as either a Board member or a committee  member, please call or stop by the office to  fill out a Statement of Interest form, and our  Nominating Committee or the relevant  committee chair will contact you.       Please take a minute to think about just  how important our community is to you and  your family. What can we do to preserve the  special qualities of Sandia Heights that made  us decide to live here? What can we do to  make life here even better?  The only way  we can have an impact on these and other  issues is to have active Board and committee  members. I hope you will consider giving a  few hours of your time every month to your  community.                 The GRIT, November 2011                                                                                                    Page 2  Letter to the editor    SOMETIMES BEING A   GOOD NEIGHBOR CAN  CAUSE UNINTENTIONAL  MAIL PROBLEMS         I think many of us would agree that we  have some pretty nice neighbors in Sandia  Heights who watch out for each other—I  know I do in my neighborhood. Sometimes,  though, in the act of being courteous, we do  not know that we could be creating other  problems just by trying to be nice. Here are  some of those unintentional problems that  should be brought to everyone’s attention.        In checking for a package at my  neighbor’s, who was expecting it but who  was on vacation, I saw the mailbox slightly  open and was surprised to find a magazine  in it, since he had stopped the mail. It had a  nice note that it had been misdelivered. The  good neighbor who got the magazine at his  house did not know that, of course.  So what  should the neighbor have done? LESSON  #1: If you receive someone else’s mail,  please go to that person’s door to deliver it.  If you cannot do that, call your neighbors to  let them know you have their mail, or leave  it inside their door. Thieves love to see mail  and packages that have not been picked  up—their signal that no one is home.         In a second incident, I found mail  addressed to me in my box, but too early in  the day to have been delivered by my  carrier. Again, this was misdelivered mail  that a kind unknown neighbor had put into  my mailbox. If I had not seen it there, it is  possible the carrier could have picked it up  as outgoing mail (they do not stop to read  where it is going, just grab it), and it would  have been a week at least before I got it  back. LESSON #2: Most people do not  know that the mailbox is not their personal  property. It is actually property of the USPS,  even if you paid for it. The only people  allowed to put mail into your box are postal  employees. So, please do not leave  misdelivered mail in your neighbor’s box.         Finally, neighbors have delivered mail of  mine that they mistakenly received, but it  was three weeks after the postmark date on  the envelopes. In that case, I wish the  neighbor had called me, and I would have  gladly picked it up. I wasted time trying to  track an important envelope down that I was  expecting. LESSON #3: Go through your  mail when you first receive it (5 seconds).  Do not wait any time to notify your neighbor  you received their mail. Walk down to their  house, check to see whether they are home  and, if not, put it in their door with a note, or  call them. They may be expecting something  important, and may have made many calls  trying to find out what happened to their  mail. So, take care of that misdelivered mail  immediately.        Yes, mail sometimes gets misdelivered.  In 2009, the US Postal Service delivered  175,677,241,000 pieces of mail (excluding  ancillary services such as certified mail).  While the mail is sorted on machines, when  addresses are not clear or are incomplete,  misdeliveries do happen. In addition,  sometimes a different carrier on your route  may not be familiar with the address  numbers. We have some terribly convoluted  address numbering in Sandia Heights,  including both even and odd addresses on  the same side of the street (not a good  thing).         The busy holiday mail season is upon us.  So, let us not make the misdelivery problem  any worse, and deliver that mail to our  neighbors in person or at their door as soon  as possible. And check your neighbor’s  house that you are watching to see that there  is no mail in their box or at their door. They  will appreciate it, believe me.

Since  the original publication of this article, the  ACC has received many requests for the  installation of roofs using relatively new  materials known as “cool roof” materials  that, when installed, significantly reduce the  amount of energy needed to cool a home.   Most of these materials are available in  several colors including white and various  shades of tan.  The difference in the overall  energy savings of a white material and most  of the tan materials is relatively  insignificant--about four to five percent (the  white material, of course, is slightly more  energy efficient).       Many of the individual unit covenants in  Sandia Heights specifically prohibit the use  of white roofing materials.  In response to  the demand for these energy-saving  materials and the overall benefits to the  homeowner (and to our environment) in  terms of reduced utility costs, the ACC  agreed that a strict interpretation of the  covenants regarding the use of white roofing  materials needed some “common sense”  adjustments.  These adjustments were  reflected in a revision of the “ACC Design  Guideline for Roofing” published in  December 2009 and summarized in the  January 2010 GRIT article.  For the sake of  brevity, the following is an abbreviated  summary of some of the key points  discussed in the revised Guideline:       1.  The use of white roofing materials  will be approved by the ACC if the roof is  not visible from nearby residences or from  local streets.  Keep in mind that since Sandia  Heights slopes primarily downward from  east to west, “nearby residences” may be  more than just a few homes surrounding the  residence wanting to use the white material  and may extend a considerable distance  (maybe several blocks or so) in the uphill  direction.  The point here is that the ACC  wants to ensure that the high solar  reflectivity of the white roofing material  does not have a negative impact on  neighboring properties.  Nobody wants to  look at a bright, white roof!   If the ACC  determines that a negative impact will be  created by using white material, the use of a  tan alternative having a lower solar  reflectance value (nominally, 65 or less) will  be acceptable.  Remember that the loss of  energy efficiency is only a few percent by  using the tan instead of the white material.   When in doubt, use tan—you won’t get any  “flak” from the ACC!       2.  The other part of the roof material  equation is what is called the “gloss factor”.   Gloss is a measure of the degree to which a  surface functions like a mirror.  Roofing  materials with high gloss finishes have the  potential to reflect nuisance levels of light  onto nearby properties.  Again, as with  color, nobody wants to look at a bright,  white roof with a mirror-like finish!  Gloss  scales range from 20 or less for matte,  eggshell, and velvet flat surface finishes to  greater than 85 for high gloss surfaces such  as smooth metal materials.      Continued on page 8    The GRIT, November 2011                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7       The ACC will not approve a high gloss  finish for a roofing material (unless, of course,  nobody can see the roof) and encourages the  use of materials with gloss factors of 20 or less.   When in doubt, use low gloss tan materials— you absolutely won’t get any “flak” from the  ACC.       Please refer to the “ACC Design Guideline  for Roofing” for a more detailed discussion of  this subject.  This document is available on the  SHHA website and at the SHHA office.  When  applying for a roof using these “cool roof”  materials, it would be appreciated if you could  obtain a small color sample of the material  along with the manufacturer’s specifications  that discuss the solar reflectance and specular  gloss characteristics of the material.      z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   368 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Stucco Coat &  Trim  409 Live Oak Loop – Repaint Trim  438 Live Oak Loop – Stucco & Trim  447 Live Oak Loop – Canales  801 Tramway Lane – Landscaping (Antique  Wagon)  657 Roadrunner Lane – Repair and Resurface  Asphalt Driveway  1018 Tramway Lane – Reroof  1135 Marigold Drive – Wall and Landscaping  1429 San Rafael Avenue – Repaint Trim, Gates  and Garage Door  1561 Eagle Ridge Court – Reroof  1555 Eagle Ridge Road - Re-Coat Stucco  1844 Tramway Terrace Loop – Repaint Trim  1945 Quail Run Loop – Garage Door  Replacement  2007 Quail Run Drive – Repaint Garage Door  2131 Globe Willow Avenue – Doors &  Window Replacement  2149 Black Willow Drive – Patio Cover  2317 Calle de Rafael – Reroof  2516 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence & Gate  7738 Cedar Canyon Road – Reroof  12521 Colony Place – Window Replacement  12622 Colony Place – Patio Cover  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management        z  zz  zz  zz  z      ELECTRONIC ARCHIVING  OF ACC DOCUMENTS         Earlier this year, the ACC office staff  completed the monumental task of  electronically archiving all of the residential  files including the large format rolled plans.   This effort saved the community over $15,000  in lieu of hiring an outside source to  accomplish this task. Details of this effort were  explained in the May, 2011 edition of the  GRIT. The ACC is now in the process of  returning all of the large format plans to  respective property owners of record. A letter  will be sent to all property owners who have  not yet retrieved these plans, if you do not  receive a letter then  we do not have any  plans for you. If these  plans are not picked up  at the SHHA office by  31 January, 2012, they  are scheduled to be  destroyed.
