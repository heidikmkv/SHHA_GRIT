    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           March 2011                    President’s Message by   Phyllis Moore              On Saturday January 29 SHHA  Homeowners Association collaborated with  our District 4, County Commissioner,  Michael Wiener to hold a meeting to  basically discuss the County Line Summer  concerts and the proposed Noise Ordinance  and the impact to our Sandia Heights  residents. The meeting allowed our County  Commissioner, Michael Wiener, to explain  his point of view for proposed ordinance  change. County Line Restaurant owner,  Skeeter Miller, addressed his objective for the  summer concert series.  After both speakers  shared their respective points of view,  residents were granted time to share their  individual experiences with the concert  series. George Schroeder representing the  Bernalillo County Environmental Health also  contributed to the meeting regarding the  technical decibel sound levels gathered  during past concerts and addressed decibel  sound level questions.         In addition to the above speakers, our  newly elected Bernalillo County Sherriff,  Dan Houston addressed our SHHA  community residents about his plans and  goals for Bernalillo County surveillance. He  also addressed the issues and concerns  confronting our specific community  regarding the excessive motorcycle noise and  racing on Tramway Blvd during late night  and early morning hours. The one outcome  that stands out in my mind will be the  planned increased presence of Sherriff  vehicles for surveillance within the Sandia  Heights community. Following the Sherriff  Dan Houston presentation, a Question and  Answering session was conducted for our  SHHA residents.  Sheriff Houston did request  our individual inputs regarding our issues and  concerns and recommended we use the  following phone number to contact him:   Sherriff Dan Houston (249-9442).       We were fortunate to have the services of  a neutral facilitator, Tim Karpoff. According  to the facilitator the key concerns regarding  the concert series for our SHHA residents so  far include:        Property Values, Concert – frequency,  duration, Air Pollution, Fencing, Casino  Relations, Wildlife Impact, Motorcycle noise,  Parking and Trash. *Note these topics were  gleaned from the email traffic between  Commissioner Wiener and our SHHA  residents.         Please watch our SHHA website and  GRIT publication for future developments  and any notification about Proposed Noise  Ordnance hearings.       I want to thank each of you that took time  to attend and demonstrate your interest and  concern regarding this SHHA community  issue.

AMENDMENT #1 –To Bylaws Section 7.1.3: change the  first sentence, which currently reads:     7.1.3 Directors’ Participation on  Committees:  All Directors except for the  President shall serve on at least two (2)  Standing Committees.   To read: All Directors except for the  President shall serve on at least one  Standing Committee.      Rationale:  SHHA committees can be adequately staffed  with Board members serving on one committee.  Board  members may serve on additional committees at their  discretion. This change will also make Board membership  more feasible to residents who wish to serve but whose time  commitments would prevent them from serving on more  than one committee.  CONS: None are known.     AMENDMENT #2 - To Bylaws Sections:  7.2.4, 7.2.5 and 7.2.7: change the first  sentence which currently reads:    7.2.4 Covenant Support Committee. The  Covenant Support Committee (CSC) - shall  consist of a minimum of five (5) Board  members, excluding ex officio members.  For each Unit in Sandia Heights for which  CSC has responsibility, the Board authorizes  it to take necessary and appropriate actions  to enforce the Unit covenants as set forth in  its charter, as well as other functions as may  be set forth in its charter.     7.2.5 Community Service and Membership  Committee. The Community Service and  Membership Committee shall consist of a  minimum of three (3) Board members  excluding ex officio members. It shall be  responsible for activities which enhance a  sense of community and perform such other  duties and functions as set forth in its  charter.    7.2.7 Parks and Safety Committee. The  Parks and Safety Committee shall consist of  a minimum of three (3) Board members  excluding ex officio members and shall be  responsible for overseeing park issues,  working with Bernalillo County on traffic,  road and safety related matters such as  proper visibility along roadways, making  recommendations to the Board and  appropriate legislators, and such other duties  and functions as are set forth in its charter.  Change the first sentence of each to read:  “shall consist of a minimum of two (2)  Board members.”      Rationale:  There appears to be no historical  rationale for requiring more than two Board  members on these committees.  This change  will make the requirement for a minimum of  two Board members consistent for all  standing committees.  CONS: None are known.                Tennis or Swimming Anyone?

Wiener -  District 4     I want to thank all of you who contacted  me in December and January expressing  concerns about the County Line Restaurant  and the loud noise, parking issues, littering,  etc.  I replied to everyone, returned every  phone call and met with anyone who wanted  to personally discuss this situation. The three- hour meeting we held at the Church of the  Good Shepherd on Saturday, January 29th was  well-attended and everyone there had an  opportunity to speak and to hear from County  Line owner Skeeter Miller.   Action was just deferred on the  amendments I authored to the County Noise  Ordinance for 90 days so we can conduct  several more meetings throughout the county.   On February 6th, the Journal ran my Op-Ed  article in which I explained why the current  Noise Ordinance is simply not working and a  pro-active permit process might be the  answer. If you have not read this article you  can do so at the Bernalillo County website:  www.bernco.gov   Where do we go from here to resolve the  situation with the County Line? The only  complete resolution would be for Bernalillo  County to buy the restaurant and turn it into a  neighborhood community center. Not such  a far-fetched idea and our staff  IS looking  into this; we've already done an initial  appraisal/assessment.  It would take three  votes, I have two and need to convince one  other commissioner of the soundness of this  idea. District 4 residents pay an enormous  amount in property taxes and to be honest, we  are not getting our fair share in return. I only  have one community center in my vast  sprawling district and that is in Paradise Hills  over 15 miles away.   Maybe if we organized an effort to show  support from Sandia Heights residents that a  community center is needed and desired we  could solve two problems?  It would certainly  bear more fruit than expressing anger at the  loud music emanating from the County Line.  New Sheriff Dan Houston has given  Sandia Heights residents assurances that he  will step-up patrols and will do everything  possible to stop the loud motorcycle noise on  Tramway. He has met with County Line  owner Skeeter Miller to address the problem  of illegally parked cars on Tramway during  the Thursday night concerts.  Sheriff Houston  has graciously provided his personal cell  phone number: 249-9442 to Sandia Heights  residents in case you need to reach him.  January was a challenging, frustrating and  very emotional month for Bernalillo County  Government. As you know, a 3 to 2 majority  on the County Commission decided it was  time to remove and replace our County  Manager; a decision I did not support.  I had  an excellent and very productive working  relationship with Thaddeus Lucero and he was  beloved by our staff and employees who knew  how effective he was at getting things done!   He had served as a stabilizing force for the  past seven years in this very complicated post,  managing  2,500 county employees and  ultimately being responsible and blamed for  everything that happened in our Metropolitan  Detention Center. The MDC incarcerates over  40,000 people each year (that represents 5% of  our county population) and costs taxpayers  $71 million a year to operate.  It is our biggest  single expense and largest source of  frustration which is why our politically astute  former Mayor Marty Chavez gladly unloaded  it on us.  The three newest members of the five  member Commission decided it was time to  change the "culture" in Bernalillo County and  now we have begun an arduous and expensive  national search to select a new manager while  paying Mr. Lucero over $150,000 to exit  quietly.  I can understand the new  commissioners frustration, as I too read the  daily dirt dispensed with delight by the  Albuquerque Journal.  Unfortunately, our lone  surviving daily fish wrap never covers  anything positive that we accomplish - yet  always finds front page headline space to feast  The GRIT, 2011                                                                                                              Insert pages  on and regurgitate anything that just doesn't  quite sit right with their editorial staff.     Believe me when I assure you that I'm not  an apologist for all that HAS gone wrong in  Bernalillo County Government, but for God's  sake, any and all irregularities HAVE BEEN  corrected and action was taken QUICKLY by  the County Commission. Proudly, we have a  new ethics ordinance, a balanced budget, a  Triple A Bond Rating, have not had to cut  salaries or lay anyone off and have been the  recipient of numerous national honors and  prestigious management awards;  all of which  have mysteriously escaped the coverage of the  Albuquerque Journal.  Don't we deserve ANY  credit for getting anything right?  Apparently  not when it comes to our lone  surviving tabloid.   Last year, with great pride, I re-dedicated  a 16 acre Hang Gliding park in North  Albuquerque Acres to honor Sandia Heights  resident and former Apollo 17 astronaut  Senator Harrison Schmitt - yet the Journal did  not deem  it newsworthy. Same with the  groundbreaking ceremony we held for the $25  million Eubank Blvd. expansion/widening  project, the Journal was not there to cover it.   Just not controversial, I guess? But I thought it  was a NEWSpaper?   Blaming Thaddeus Lucero, and  subsequently removing him - while leaving  Winston Brooks in charge of the  failing Albuquerque Public Schools after a  litany of far worse management disasters  (including: teachers stealing and fencing  stolen televisions, janitors stealing computers,  rampant and repeated school vandalism,  massive scheduling anomalies, broken pipes at  over fifty schools costing in excess of $1  million to fix, and a dropout rate that is a  national embarrassment)  I find to be  inconsistent at best!  Wait a minute, didn't the  APS Board just vote to EXTEND Mr. Brooks  contract for another year?  Where is the  outrage and disbelief over this extraordinary  hypocrisy?   Moving on to other issues....Soon we will  be holding a meeting in Sandia Heights to  discuss plans to deal with impending new and  expensive 2015 septic tank regulations and  what other options exist, including sewer  connections.  Our staff has been working  diligently on this assessment.   I am always available to my constituents  at: mcwabq@aol.com and can be reached by  phone at 858-0004 or on my cell 688-0004, or  at my office 468-7010 to my assistant Darrell  Dady.

In that regard, SHHA arranged  for residents to meet with and provide input  to our County Commissioner, our Sheriff  and other County personnel at the Church of  the Good Shepherd on Saturday morning,  January 29.        Notes form this meeting are now posted  on the main page of the Bernalillo County  website at www.bernco.gov. The Proposed  Noise Ordinance amendment was discussed  at the Tuesday, February 8 BC Commission  meeting and detailed information about this  meeting is posted on the SHHA website at  www.sandiahomeowners.org.

There are 5 different government  agencies along with Sandia Heights Services  (SHS) which are involved in the current  sewer/septic tank situation.  These include  the State of New Mexico Environmental  Department, Bernalillo County (Bernco),  Bernalillo County Board of Commissioners,  Bernalillo County Water and Sewer  Authority, and The State of New Mexico  Public Regulatory Commission (PRC).         Sandia Heights Services (SHS) currently  serves approximately 473 sewer customers  in Sandia Heights.  SHS has the right to  serve these customers since they own the  sewer and water franchise for Sandia  Heights.  The sewer franchise is regulated  by the PRC.       The SHS sewer line feeds into the sewer  system operated by the Bernco Water/Sewer  Authority.  SHS is a customer of the Bernco  Water/Sewer Authority.       According to SHS, their sewer line is  near full capacity, and they have no plans to  expand their sewer system.       The Bernco Water/Sewer Authority is the  operator of the sewer system.  Expansion of  the sewer system would require the approval  of the Bernco County Commissioners.  At  this time, the Bernco County Commissioners  have no plans to expand the sewer system to  serve Sandia Heights.  Estimates of building  a new sewer system into Sandia Heights  would cost $50-60 million.       The Bernalillo County Commissioners  adopted a set of septic tank rules which are  separate and different then the rules set by  the State of New Mexico Environmental  Department.  The stricter septic tank rules  are set to begin in 2015.       The Sandia Heights Sewer/Septic sub- committee has been meeting with the  various agencies mentioned above along  with Sandia Heights Services in order to  determine what action we can take to  improve our situation.  We will be meeting  Commissioner Michael Wiener and various  Bernco Environmental employees to explore  the fairness of the septic tank rules as they  relate to Sandia Heights.                   SHHA member benefits            Your SHHA member benefits and  services include: office and notary services,  annual classified ads, Coffeehouse Concert  Series, Sandia Tram passes, tree lottery,  covenant enforcement, no-fee ACC  applications, and discounted safety vests.

These variance requests are normally  received as part of the application for a new  construction or home improvement project and  usually involve asking for a relaxation of the  dimensional setback requirements imposed by  the covenants. These variance requests are one  of the most difficult parts of the ACC approval  process and are very carefully considered prior  to making an approval or denial decision.  So how does the ACC handle a variance  request?  The first step is to work with the  property owner to see if there are alternatives to  the home improvement or new construction  design that would eliminate the need for a  variance request. If not, the ACC then proceeds  to debate the merits of the variance request.   The ACC will grant a variance only when it can  be shown that there are specific physical  characteristics of the lot (arroyo locations, steep  grades, etc.) which, without relief from  covenant restrictions, prevent construction of a  residence (or making a modification to an  existing residence) that is in parity with other  local residences. Parity is determined in terms  of the average size and features of other local  residences. In such cases, the ACC will grant a  variance in order to bring the disadvantaged  property up to the level enjoyed by nearby  properties but not so as to create an advantage  over limitations placed on the other properties.  In addition, the ACC will try to provide relief  in ways that minimize deviations from the spirit  and intent of the covenants and that will  minimize any negative impact upon the  interests, welfare, and rights of the owners of  other local properties. If, however, it is  determined at this time that there is insufficient  justification to support the variance request, the  property owner will be so informed in writing.  Once the ACC decides to grant the  variance, a neighborhood review will be  conducted to ensure that all owners of nearby  properties are fully informed that a project  within their neighborhood contains a request  for a variance. Upon receipt of comments from  neighbors, the ACC will proceed with the  evaluation of the entire project and, if  approved, will include a written justification for  granting the variance in the approval letter to  the applicant.                      Please join us for our first  SHHA Easter Egg  Hunt at the WL  Jackson Park (Cedar  Hill and Tramway) on  Saturday, April 23,  2011, 10am-12pm.

Sandia Heights Artists News… We will be having the 2011 Studio Tour  on September 10 & 11.   If you missed the very productive meeting in January, you still  have time to get involved.    Although the tour is our main event, please consider showing  your work at the Holiday Sale (date tba), the coffee houses and the SHHA Meet &  Greets.  There is also a web site: sandiaheightsart.com  for any artist in our  community.  All Sandia Heights Artists are encouraged to use this opportunity to support  each others arts and to support our community.  Artists can also contact Kathryn Lazier if  they would like to show their work at any of the coffee houses this year or at the SHHA  meetings. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TOUR:   The deadline for joining the tour is April  30, by which time all artists need to have contributed $75 to the costs and have provided  information on themselves and their art for the studio map.  CONTACT Kathryn Lazier  797-0974 or kalazier@gmail.com  to let her know if you plan to participate in the tour or  would like more information.
