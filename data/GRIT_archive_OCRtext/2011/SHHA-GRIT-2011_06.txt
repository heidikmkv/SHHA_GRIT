Democracy means involvement!        President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry     It is hard to believe the year has sped by  and we are coming up on the Annual  Meeting. Please make plans to spend some  time with us on Saturday, June 11 to provide  your input and support your homeowners’  association. We need your attendance to  meet our quorum so we can conduct  business. Please join us!     This has been a good year for SHHA and  an active one. We have continued to uphold  the quality of life in Sandia Heights in many  ways:  by working with residents to ensure  adherence to the covenants that exist to  maintain the beauty and desirability of our  neighborhood, by keeping you informed  about issues that affect Sandia Heights, and  by providing numerous member services  and benefits. Our committees have worked  tirelessly to maintain the architectural  standards which preserve the look and feel  that make Sandia Heights unique and to  enforce the covenants and resolve  complaints between neighbors. This year has  seen problematic issues related to proposed  changes in the County noise ordinance and  implementation of the existing County  wastewater ordinance. Our special task  forces have worked diligently to understand  these matters and how they affect Sandia  Heights, and have kept you informed of  public meetings and other developments as  they happen. In addition to these  exceptionally important tasks, our  committees have come up with even more  services and benefits for members. New  discounts for local restaurants and  businesses are continually being added, and  while the Four Seasons Club is in its final  season, you can still enjoy free passes to the  pool and tennis courts as long as the  facilities are open.                                   Continued on page 2  The GRIT, June 2011                                                                                                            Page 2  Continued from front page  And do not forget that notary and office  services (copies and faxes) are free to  members. The ever-popular free Tram passes  are a wonderful member benefit, and the free  Coffeehouse concerts and informative Meet &  Greet events also enhance our quality of life.  The Tree Lottery, now in its second year, is a  great opportunity for members to qualify for  reimbursement when they remove invasive  tree species, like Siberian elms, and trees that  have grown so tall that they block neighbors’  views. New events this year included photos  with Santa Claus and an all-ages Easter egg  hunt, both of which were wildly successful  and will be repeated next year. The most  amazing thing about all these services and  benefits is that they were all accomplished by  a small number of dedicated and hard-working  volunteers. I know you join me in expressing  my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to your  Board members, all our volunteers, and our  incredible office staff for their commitment,  persistence, enthusiasm and hard work to  support you, our members.       Very special thanks go out to the people  who are leaving the Board and committees  this year after dedicating their time and effort  to the betterment of the community:  Jon Cashwell recently served on the Board  and on the Covenant Support Committee since  2010.  Bruce Childs has served on the Board and on  the Communications and Publications and  Community Service and Membership  Committees since 2008.  Phyllis Moore has served on the Board, on the  Community Service and Membership  Committee, as Vice President, and as  President since 2008.   Ed Tull has served on the Board, as Treasurer  and as chair of the Finance Committee since  2006.  Special recognition goes to Mike Winokur,  who passed away in December. Mike was a  very active Board member since 2006, and  served on the Architectural Control  Committee and as chair of the Community  Service and Membership Committee.  His  contributions to SHHA were invaluable, and  we miss his sense of humor and his cheerful  willingness to do whatever needed to be done.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Wastewater Ordinance Update        The Wastewater/Septic Tank Committee has  been working diligently to understand the  issues concerning the Bernalillo County  wastewater ordinance scheduled to be  implemented in 2015. We have had several  meetings with County officials that helped  convince some County Commissioners to  consider removing the 2015 date from the  ordinance. At the May 10 County Commission  meeting, an amendment was introduced to  eliminate the 2015 date. The amendment will  be posted for public comment for 30 days,  after which the Commission will vote on it. If  the date is removed, residents would be able to  maintain their existing septic systems as long  as they are working properly. We will  continue to keep you updated on this issue as  events unfold. If you have questions, please  feel free to call Bob Francis at   798-9787 or Ed Whitten at 821-1884.    z  zz  zz  zz  z  Storm Drains on County  Easements and Roads         Most properties here in Sandia Heights  have a County easement that runs along the  edges of the property that border the existing  roads. These easements are normally about  seven or so feet in width. To handle the runoff  water during our rainy season, many  residences have storm drains installed either  by the County or by the property owner with  County approval located within these  easements which carry water in channels  along the road and, if necessary, under  existing walkways and driveways that traverse  the easements. In some cases, these channels  continue under the road so the runoff water  empties into an arroyo or into another  drainage system to prevent flooding of  residential properties.    Continued on Page 3  The GRIT, June 2011                                                                                                           Page 3  Continued from page 2  The County is responsible for inspecting and  cleaning these drains but simply does not  have the manpower to perform these tasks  on a regular basis.  As a property owner, if  you observe that any of the drains located on  County easements or under roads near your  property are clogged with dirt or other  debris, you can place a call to the County  Road Department at 848-1540 and they will  inspect and clean out these drains. Please  keep in mind that the County will not  inspect and clean any drains that are not  within the existing easements.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    FAMILY MOVIE  NIGHT   Mark your calendars:   Saturday July 9, 2011   SHHA will be hosting  our first family movie night!    Come gather with your neighbors and have  some summer fun as we watch a family  movie under the stars. Bring the kids,  blanket, and drinks.   We will provide the Big Screen  and Popcorn. This will take  place at Jackson Park (Cedar  Hill and Tramway) at 7:00pm      z  zz  zz  zz  z    Tree Lottery News – No Cost Tree  Removal for Association Members?     We know that many of you are planning to  enter the tree lottery but have not yet done so.  But as of this writing, if the lottery were to be  held tomorrow, every tree entered to date would  be paid for in full – now there are some really  good odds!!       Eighty-nine percent of our residents have  stated that they were either very concerned or  somewhat concerned with undue obstruction of  views by trees (extrapolated from the January  2006 ACC Covenant Enforcement Survey.)   Now is the time to act on our convictions and do  our part to curtail, reduce, and reverse the  otherwise relentless advance of trees into our  distant mountain and valley views. The SHHA  Tree Lottery now provides an excellent chance  for Association Members to have all or most of  their tree removal costs paid for by the  Association!      How Is your Curb Appeal? Now is a good  time to add tree removal to your plans for yard  work this spring. Open up your own mountain  and valley views and those of your neighbors by  selectively cutting trees that have grown too  large for their original intended purpose.       Those little evergreens that looked so  attractive when your home was new and now  overhang and visually dominate it may detract  from its value as well. Remember, not only can  overgrown foundation plantings cause structural  problems for your house and functional  problems for your septic system and your water  and gas supply lines, they can also spoil your  home’s curb appeal. Removing overgrown  foundation plantings can add significantly to  your house’s appearance and add dollars to the  value of your property-- just one more reason to  have them removed and to enter the lottery.         The SHHA Tree Lottery will once again  provide an excellent chance for Association  Members to have all or most of their tree  removal costs paid for by the Association!                   ANNOUNCEMENTS &  NOTICES:    Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am  – 4pm.     Annual Meeting: Saturday, June 11  at the Church of the Good Shepherd.    Notary services, copies and faxes  free to members.

Weather predictions are  indicating limited precipitation and above- normal temperatures for the coming months.   These conditions combine to make the chances  of wildfires here in Sandia Heights higher than  in years of normal precipitation and less severe  winds.  As a property owner here in this  community, you have access to several good  sources of information that recommend  measures you can take to enhance the  survivability of your property in the event of a  wildfire on or near your property.  A very  detailed article on this subject has been  published by the New Mexico State Forestry  (NMSF) entitled “Creating Wildfire-Defensible  Zones” and is available at the NMSF website  using the following link:  http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/emnrd/biomass/ docs/Defensible%20Space.pdf. Copies of this  brochure are also available at the SHHA office.       Most of our unit covenants state that  “natural vegetation is to be left undisturbed  where practical on all lots except for access to  property, clearing of building sites, and  establishment of lawns and flower beds  adjacent to buildings”.  In addition, the  Architectural Control Committee (ACC) has  published a “Design Guideline for  Landscaping” which makes the following  points:  1. Sandia Heights is based on an open space  concept where the natural vegetation is of  great importance.  The deed restrictions for  the area require that the natural vegetation  be left undisturbed where possible and  replenished after construction is finished.  2.  Residents are asked to keep their properties  clear of dead trees/vegetation.  Chamisa and  other vegetation can be a safety hazard  when it blocks views along roads or creates  a fire hazard.       The inclusion of the terms “where practical”  and “where possible” in the covenant and ACC  guideline language gives you, the property  owner, considerable latitude to make wise  decisions based on your perception of the  damage to your property that could occur as a  result of a local wildfire. Although SHHA does  not endorse a “bare earth” policy as it pertains                                        Continued on  page 11  Advertisements do not represent an endorsement by SHHA.
