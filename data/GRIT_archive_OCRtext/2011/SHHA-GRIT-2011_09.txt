We  all need to be aware of children walking to  and from school bus stops, and remember to  yield to buses loading and unloading  passengers.  The earliest buses will soon be  picking up kids in near darkness, so please  be extra watchful as you navigate our  picturesque winding streets.  Please also be  on the lookout for residents enjoying a walk  during the cooler hours of dawn and dusk.       The days are starting to get shorter, and  soon we will notice the crispness of fall in  the air.  Fall is traditionally a good time to  plant trees and shrubs, because the plants  can establish strong root systems and be  ready to grow vigorously in the spring.  You  might be thinking of replacing plants that  were killed by the sub-zero temperatures last  winter.  However, many forecasters are  talking about another dry winter with very  cold temperatures, so you might want to  wait until next year to think about new  plantings.  To help established plants make  it through a harsh winter, water deeply about  once a month.  Watering plants is probably  the last thing we think about when we’re  snug indoors in the winter, but water will  really help your landscaping survive.  Dry  conditions are more likely to kill plants than  cold weather alone.       The outdoor concerts at The County Line  restaurant this summer have generated  intense discussions in Sandia Heights, with  SHHA members having many different  views.  Bernalillo County issued a Notice of  Violation of the noise ordinance to the  County Line, followed by a criminal  complaint which is scheduled for trial on  September 8.            Continued on page 2  The GRIT, September 2011                                                                                                    Page 2     Continued from front page         The County also issued a Notice of  Violation of the zoning ordinance as a  consequence of the concerts being  conducted within the off-street parking  area of the restaurant.  SHHA investigated  other complaints associated with the  concerts, and in August our attorney sent a  letter to the County Line advising them  that SHHA fully concurs with and  supports the activities of Bernalillo  County, and requested that the County  Line discontinue the outdoor concerts and  that no outdoor concerts be held in  upcoming years.   We will continue to  appraise the situation and to keep you  informed as information becomes  available.       We continue to need volunteers to  serve on the Board of Directors and our  committees. We have many different  opportunities for volunteers, and we  welcome people who have the time and  energy to help keep Sandia Heights a great  place to come home to.  If you would like  to join in to serve your community, please  call the SHHA office or contact any of the  Board members to sign up.                   Renters and Membership  Benefits         Did you know that people renting  houses in Sandia Heights can participate  in many of the benefits of SHHA  membership? All that is needed is for the  property owner to maintain membership  in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move  from Sandia Heights and rent their house  to another family, they must cancel their  membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be  collected as part of the monthly utility  bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the  bill. If you as a property owner pay the  bill, you are free to pass along the cost of  membership to the tenant if you choose.  Renters are eligible for all SHHA  membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Tram passes are among the  most popular member benefits, so be  sure you maintain your membership so  your tenants can experience some of the  great “perks” of living in Sandia  Heights!                 ATTENTION!

If someone tries to break in  simply spray them in the face. It will shoot up to 20 or 30 feet  and temporarily blinds the perpetrator until he can get  medical attention. It is also not as obvious as a can of mace or  pepper spray and is more accurate.      Don’t ace it  E IT  iia  CasiNet REFACING  Pe val a ‘see beautiful results  BUNDLE UP: .

Thank  you.                CHOOSING YOUR HOME’S  EXTERIOR COLORS         A large percentage of applications  received by the ACC for exterior  modifications to residential homes relate to  colors for garage doors, stucco, trim paint,  etc. When contemplating these tasks, many  homeowners assume that an application is  not needed if the existing colors remain the  colors of choice for restuccoing and  repainting and that by using the same colors,  the exterior appearance of the residence is  not being changed.  This is absolutely  correct, but the ACC and your neighbors do  not know this and when your contractors  show up to restucco or repaint, the SHHA  office often gets phone calls from nearby  residents who state that “something is going  on and I do not see an application for this  address on the ACC project log.”  These  inquiries precipitate a phone call to the  resident where the work is occurring and the  resident is asked to file an after-the-fact  application for the work.  These applications  can be approved within a day or so for a  replacement-in-kind of the stucco or paint  being used and will be noted in the ACC log  of approved projects.         Bottom Line:  For exterior repainting or  restuccoing jobs, even if the new colors will  match the existing ones, submit an  application—it is quick and easy and can  usually be administratively approved within  a day or so.       Now, let us say that you want to change  the existing garage door, trim, and/or stucco  colors.  Most of the Unit covenants specify  that the color schemes for a proposed  structure must be “in harmony” with the  general surroundings.  The ACC interprets  this subjective language to mean that which  is harmonious is that which tends to blend  into the natural terrain and vegetation, thus  mimicking the colors of the landscape in the  proximity of the proposed structure.   Obviously, there is lots of “give and take”  here due to the subjective nature of this  matter.  As such, the ACC has established a  list of proposed colors that meet the intent of  “harmonious” to provide some form of  guidance when making decisions on color  schemes proposed by residents for items  such as stucco, trim, garage doors, etc.         If you are not sure that your color  selections will pass the “ACC test”, check  with the SHHA office concerning the list of  approved colors.  Over the years, many new  products have come on the market especially  in the area of external coatings such as  acrylic and elastomeric stucco.  Many of  these products come in a variety of colors  that, for the most part, are close to the list of  colors that the ACC will approve.  With the  exception of white, very light colors, and  very dark colors, most colors fall within the  range of what is acceptable to the ACC.  In  general, these applications can be  administratively approved within a few days  of submission.        Again, Bottom Line:  If you are not sure  about your proposed colors, take the time to  consult with the ACC and avoid the risk of  using colors which may not be approved and  that you may be asked to remove.                             Continued on page 8  The GRIT, September 2011                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7         Remember, however, that the ACC will not  force you to change colors if your residence has  existing colors which fall outside the range of  colors that the ACC will approve.  In essence,  you are “grandfathered” if you prefer to retain  these colors.      z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   18 Cedar Hill – Awning  37 Rock Ridge Drive – Stucco Repair  49 Cedar Hill Road – AC Installation  60 Juniper Hill Loop – Restucco  61 Juniper Hill Court – Second Story Addition  80 Juniper Hill Place – Retaining Wall  165 Juniper Hill Road – Landscaping & Wall  216 Spring Creek Place – Addition  368 Big Horn Ridge – Reroof & window  replacement  424 Live Oak Court – Playground equipment  605 Cedar Hill Road – Reroof  657 Roadrunner Lane – Restucco  808 Tramway Lane - Driveway  865-1 Tramway Lane - Fence  869-D Tramway Lane Court – Paint Wall   910 Tramway Lane – Restucco   945 Deer Drive – Landscaping  969 Antelope Avenue – Remodel/Addition  990 Lynx Loop – Awning  1229 Rockrose Road – Landscaping  1404 San Rafael Place – Restucco  1532 Eagle Ridge Drive – Portal  1914 Quail Run Drive – Second Story Office  Addition  2024 Quail Run Drive - Restucco  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management      z  zz  zz  zz  z    Gnats Bugging You?         If you have lived in Sandia  Heights for any length of time,  you’re uncomfortably familiar with our gnat  population. When the gnats are at their worst,  outdoor activities become increasingly  unpleasant as the gnats swarm around us and  dive into eyes, ears, and noses. Thankfully,  there appears to be a solution to the problem  that is environmentally safe and nontoxic to  humans and pets. Cedar oil, which is extracted  from the bark of cedar trees, is a safe and  natural insect repellent that is effective against  gnats. Several companies make cedar-based  insect repellents for the yard, and we have  heard reports from a number of residents that  these products do a good job of keeping the  gnats at bay. Two companies we have heard  good reviews about are Cedarcide Industries,  Inc. (www.cedarcide.com) and Greenbug All  Natural Pest Control Products  (www.greenbugallnatural.com). These  companies also make repellents for use by  people and pets.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Dogs in Sandia Heights  and Bernalillo County  Ordinance No. 88-16  Section VI.

Keep in mind that it is unlawful for any person  to allow or permit any animal to run at large in  or on any street, alley, sidewalk, vacant lot,  public property, other unenclosed place in the  County. Any animal permitted to run at large in  violation of this section is declared to be a  nuisance, a menace to the public health and  safety, and shall be taken up and impounded.    ‘SPECIALIZING IN SANDIA HEIGHTS AND NORTH ALBUQUERQUE ACRES FOR OVER 17 YEARS,  ast como no noes  WD ODE RPA a rr A  P,  Fal Sic Oo ‘igen Pe emer  riya Ungewood (Opens Manger  Qry.

Bears are still visiting our neighborhoods looking for  food.  Please stay alert and don’t do anything to attract bears  to your home. Keep trash indoors until the morning of  pickup, bring bird feeders indoors at night, and keep kitchen  doors and windows closed after dark. Please understand  that a trapped bear does not transplant well. A high  percentage of bears die after being relocated. Simply seeing  a bear is not a reason to call Game and Fish. If there is no  food to be found, the bear will probably go back into the  mountains. Please only call Game and Fish if a bear is trying to get in your house or does not run  away when it sees you.
