(Mark your calendars!)  However, your current  Board members are starting to think, prepare  and plan for that meeting.  As we plan we are  very cognizant that we will be losing five  Board Members effective in June. We need  Sandia Heights residents to volunteer to  replace these Board Member positions and/or  volunteers to serve on a committee.         While serving as your Vice President, it  was my responsibility to recruit volunteers.   Please give me a call if you are willing to serve  our Sandia Heights community.  You will  learn more about the area in which you live,  you will get to know additional residents who  are also volunteering and care about our  community.  Please drop Kate Fry an email:  kfry4956@yahoo.com or give me a phone call  at 828-9618. We certainly hope we can count  on you to serve.      z  zz  zz  zz  z    The GRIT, Apr 2011                                                                                                           Page 3  Tree Lottery News – No Cost Tree  Removable For Association Members?    Sandia and Isleta Casinos – Eat your heart out!!  We have Tree Lottery odds that even the loosest  slots will never match! We know that many of  you are planning to enter the tree lottery but  have not yet done so. But as of this writing, if  the lottery were to be held tomorrow every tree  entered to date would be paid for in full – now  there are some really good odds!!      Eighty-nine percent of our residents have stated  that they were either very or somewhat  concerned with undue obstruction of views by  trees.* Now is the time to act on our convictions  and do our part to curtail, reduce, and reverse the  otherwise relentless advance of trees into our  distant mountain and valley views. The SHHA  Tree Lottery now provides an excellent chance  for Association Members to have all or most of  their tree removal costs paid for by the  Association!     *Extrapolated from the January 2006 ACC  Covenant Enforcement Survey    How Is your Curb Appeal?      Now is a good time to add tree removal to your  plans for yard work this spring.     Open up your own mountain and valley views  and those of your neighbors by selectively  cutting trees that have grown too large for their  original intend purpose.      Those little evergreens that looked so attractive  when your home was new and now overhang  and visually dominate it may detract from its  value as well. Remember, not only can  overgrown foundation plantings cause structural  problems for your house and functional  problems for your septic system, and water &  gas supply lines, they can also spoil your home’s  curb appeal. Removing overgrown foundation  plantings can add significantly to your house’s  appearance and add dollars to the value of your  property - just one more reason to have them  removed and to enter the lottery.        The SHHA Tree Lottery will once again provide  an excellent chance for Association Members to  have all or most of their tree removal costs paid  for by the Association!     Lottery Rules    • Must be a member of the SHHA   • Trees must have been cut and removed after  June 1, 2010  • Any size Siberian Elm** may be entered  (including young sprouts)  • Siberian Elm** stumps must be treated to  prevent re-growth  • Trees of all species over 26 feet high are  eligible  • Trees on County rights-of-way  are eligible  • Only Tree Owner can give permission  for tree removal    To Apply    • Fill out a Lottery application at the SHHA  Office  • Provide a paid copy of the invoice for tree  removal    Winners    • Drawings will follow the SHHA Annual  Meeting in June 2011  • Need not be present to win  •  Winners will receive actual cost of removal  up to a maximum of $750.00 per tree  • Drawings will continue until a total of  $7,500.00 has been awarded    Please see the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or drop by the SHHA  office for complete Lottery eligibility, entry, and  rules.

Security Tip:    Yes, a burglar will look for newspapers in the driveway and UPS  or FEDEX deliveries on your front porch; both are dead  giveaways that no one is home. Call Sandia Heights Security  when you are going out of town (even if it is just overnight).  Many burglars will leave a pizza flyer or window cleaning ad on  your door just to see how long it takes for you to remove it. Have  a neighbor keep an eye out for those things too.

The  following is a recap of the issue and the  ongoing action to address it:     In 2006 the County approved a new Waste  Water Ordinance based upon the State  Ordinance approved earlier. This ordinance  will affect many residents in Sandia Heights.  The essence of the ordinance is that if you  have lot of smaller than 3/4 of an acre you  must meet the new Septic Tank guidelines  based upon one of the following; 1) you make  a major remodel to your home or 2) you have  a failed Septic Tank system or 3) you sell your  home or 4) January 2015, which ever happens  first. If your home was built after 2001 your  system probably meets the new guidelines.  The upgrade can be quite expensive on some  homes based upon the number of occupants,  bedrooms etc.     SHHA has an ad hoc committee headed by  Bob Francis to address the impact of this  ordinance and look for ways to minimize the  impact to Sandia Heights Residents. The  committee is working with the County  Commissioner, State Legislators and Sandia  Peak Utilities to address other solutions both  long and short term. The long term solution  would be a sewer system for all of Sandia  Heights, however the current price tag for this  is over $50 Million (note that 943 homes in                                                                 Continued on Page 8  The GRIT, April 2011                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from Page 7  Sandia Heights are already currently on a sewer  system). The funding issue is a major undertaking  but the committee is working it. The more  immediate action is to get relief on the 2015  deadline. Elimination of the 2015 dead line  (which is not a State Requirement) is preferred  but an extension would help. The SHHA ad hoc  committee recently met with our county  Commissioner Michael Wiener and acting  County Manager Tom Zdunek and discussed both  solutions.. They took an action item to work the  2015 date elimination or extension. It should be  noted that with proper care of your Septic System  it can last for many years. The County has some  excellent suggestions for taking care of yours  septic system and recommendations on how often  to pump out your septic tank. Information on  the proper maintenance and information on the  Ordinance can be found on the county website at  www.bernco.gov.  SHHA also took action items  to meet again with our State Legislators and  Sandia Peak Utilities to continue working an  acceptable long term solution for Sandia Heights  residents.   If you have questions please feel free to call Bob  Francis (798-9787) or Ed Whitten (821-1884)  and/or if you are an SHHA member and would  like to see copies of minutes of the various  meetings please contact the SHHA office.               ACC Activity Log   Summary of Approved Projects activity:   8 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  413 Live Oak Loop – Restucco  611 Cedar Hill Road – Window Replacement  664 Roadrunner Lane – Patio & Wall  820-A Live Oak Road – Wall  926 Tramway Lane – Reroof, Trim & Window  Replacement  1102 Marigold Drive – Wall  1117 Rockrose Road – Landscaping & Fence  1157 Laurel Loop – Fence  1538 Eagle Ridge Place – Restucco & Reroof  1704 Quail Run Court – Parapet Repair  1843 Tramway Terrace Loop – Landscaping  1875 San Bernardino – Wall & Landscaping  2301 Calle de Rafael – Swamp Cooler  2760 Cliffrose Drive – Restucco  2884 Tramway Place – Landscaping  7742 Cedar Canyon Road - Restucco  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all project currently under ACC  management    FROM THE ACC:  TIPS FOR  PLANNING YOUR LANDSCAPING NEEDS         In May of 2009, the ACC published design  guidelines to assist Sandia Heights residents with  the planning of their landscaping needs.  These  guidelines help ensure that the installation of  landscaping is in compliance with the covenants,  blends with its surroundings, and uses plant and  tree types that are courteous to the neighborhood  by considering potential view obstruction, water  conservation, etc.  Landscaping should be  aesthetically pleasing and should maintain the  existing character of the site and support the  habitat available for local wildlife.  These  guidelines address limitations on the location,  height, and size of landscaped areas and plant  selection in order to minimally impact open  spaces and natural vegetation.  Please refer to  these guidelines when planning your landscaping  needs and keep in mind that the ACC has several  members who are very familiar with  Southwestern landscaping concepts and can assist  you during the planning phase of your  landscaping project.       As a reminder, most of our covenants here in  Sandia Heights specifically prohibit the planting  of groups of trees that constitute a screen.   Normally, three or more trees are considered to  constitute a screen if planted close enough  together so that at maturity their branches  visually touch or intertwine.  The reason for this  prohibition is to prevent undue blockage of views  from neighboring properties when these plants  reach full maturity.  In some instances, the ACC  will allow a few trees or large shrubs to serve as a  screen to obscure items like ground-mounted  heating and air conditioning equipment, pool  pumps and filters, and other such mechanical  devices.
