This is not a new issue  within our community, and at times  becomes a major irritant for other residents.   Although the published covenants for the  earliest developed units do not specifically  spell out RVs, the Second Judicial Court in  the late 1990s determined long-term parking  of RVs, camper trailers and boats on all  residential lots in Sandia Heights is  prohibited.  The court allowed parking of  such vehicles for a period of no more than  48 hours for maintenance and provisioning.        The CSC does not police the  neighborhood for violations, however, if a  complaint is received, your homeowners  association and the CSC will act upon it  with the full authority and backing of the  judicial system.  We would ask all residents  with RVs, travel trailers and boats to be  good neighbors and respect the rights of  other residents and adhere to the covenants.   Please keep in mind that the covenants are  here to ensure we can continue to live in a  pristine community and maintain the value  in our homes.                FROM THE ACC:   ELECTRONIC ARCHIVING  OF ACC FILES         Over the past several months, the SHHA  office staff completed the monumental task  of electronically archiving all of the ACC  files, which presently take up seven large  metal filing cabinets. The new files are  stored on a large volume hard drive in PDF  format. The same data are also stored on a  backup hard drive.  Access to these  electronic files will be limited to the  respective property owner of record, the  SHHA staff, and the ACC. At the ACC  meeting of March 16th, the office staff  demonstrated the new electronic system to  the Committee and will shortly begin the  task of destroying all inactive hard copies of  existing ACC files. Active files will not be  destroyed until the projects have been  completely closed and all of the pertinent  information in the hard copy files has been  transferred to the electronic files. This  method of electronically archiving a large  volume of information is standard business  practice and will result in a significant  increase in the efficiency of storing,  securing, and accessing the large amount of  material contained in the current ACC files.       The ACC also maintains a library of  large-format rolled plans for many of the  residential properties here in Sandia Heights.  To scan these documents for electronic  archiving is an expensive proposition due to  their large size.  The ACC is considering  returning these plans to the respective  homeowners for their retention. The plan is  to advertise this activity in several upcoming  issues of the GRIT and on the website with  the intent of distributing all of those plans to  the property owners of record by January  2012. In addition, the ACC application form  will be amended to require one hard copy  and one in digital format with submittals of  applications beginning in January 2012. The  SHHA office is willing to assist those  homeowners with these new requirements  and, in some cases, may waive the  requirement for the electronic copy if it  makes no sense to submit the documentation  in the electronic format due to the simplicity  of the project.                The GRIT, May 2011                                                                                                         Page 8  ACC Activity Log   Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   53 Rock Point Place – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  111 White Oaks Drive – Landscaping  425 Live Oak Loop – Deck & Patio  519 Black Bear Loop – Restucco, Reroof &  Trim  546 Black Bear Loop – Recoat Stucco  549 Black Bear Road – Landscaping  554 Black Bear Place – Stucco & Trim  533 Black Bear Road – Restucco  711-42 Tramway Place – Window  Replacement  725-18 Tramway Vista Drive – Reroof  760-12 Tramway Lane – Roof Repair &  Garage Door Replacement  795 N Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  875 Tramway Lane Court - Footbridge  941 Bobcat Blvd. – Restucco & Fence  Replacement  960 Antelope Ave. – Driveway Repair  1033 Tramway Lane – Reroof  1053 Red Oaks Loop – Reroof  1065 Tramway Lane – Reroof  1191 Laurel Loop - Reroof  1482 Morning Glory Road – Paint Trim  1708 Quail Run Court – Window Replacement  1838 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence  Replacement  1863 Tramway Terrace Loop – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  1922 Quail Run Drive – Stucco and Trim  2014 Quail Run Drive – Restucco & Trim  2302 Calle de Rafael - Wall  2448 Tramway Terrace Court - Restucco  2505 Tramway Terrace Court – Restucco, Trim  and Window Replacement  2717 /Tramway Circle – Garage Door  Replacement  2826 Tramway Place – Window Replacement  2887 Tramway Place – Fence Repair  2897 Tramway Place – Trim  12612 Carmel Court - Restucco  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management                  FROM THE ACC:  TIPS ON  DRAINING YOUR SWIMMING  POOL, ETC.         If you have a swimming pool, a large  outdoor pond or fountain, or a hot tub or  Jacuzzi that requires periodic draining, the  following tips should be helpful to you:       --If you have a septic system, do not put any  of the wastewater directly into the septic tank.   The water may overload the septic system and  cause it to fail. You should also avoid  discharging the water near any part of the  septic system since the water may find the  drain field and saturate it. Again, this could  lead to a failure of the septic system.       --The County has no specific ordinances that  specifically address the discharge of water from  a pool, etc. It is recommended that the water be  discharged in a place that will not affect  neighboring properties, not cause erosion, and  not cause any structure to be flooded.       --Ideally, the wastewater should be evenly  dispersed across a large area to prevent  negative consequences. This is easily done on  large lots but more difficult on smaller lots  (those lots less than an acre.) You should  consider a combination of slow and even  dispersal of the water across an area of your  property that is away from a septic system  drain field AND collection of the water by a  pumper truck for discharge at a wastewater  treatment plant or other suitable place  depending on the quality of the wastewater.   Heavily chlorinated wastewater may cause  permanent damage to native and non-native  landscaping. It is best that this wastewater be  transported to a wastewater treatment plant.

Siberian Elm in Setback Areas     “Generally the County Code requires that folks keep their “setback areas” (the part between the  edge of the road and the property line within the public right of way (50’ wide)) trimmed and to  maintain the landscaping, this would include the rogue elm saplings. We’ll do our usual 45-deg  angle or flat mowing for a few feet of the shoulder. If property owners are having a hard time  with elms that have gotten too big for them to handle, they may call 848-1503 for only the trees  in front of their homes (not their neighbors’) and make a work order request directly to the  County that will go to the Road Supervisor. He will help out as best he can for trees in the right  of way on an individual request basis.”    David K. Mitchell, P.E.    Are solicitors bothering you?        Solicitors in Albuquerque are forbidden by law to knock on any door where  a sign is posted, clearly stating that solicitors are not welcome. Such signs  should include the words: “No Trespassing,” or “No Peddlers,” or “No  advertisements” or “No Soliciting.”       The "no trespassing" is especially important in addition to the "no solicitation" sign. Security  officers can then ask the solicitor to leave private property. Remember virtually all of Sandia  Heights is County roadways, and there is no County ordinance that can keep them off the  roadways. Signs should be posted where they can be seen from the roadway.
