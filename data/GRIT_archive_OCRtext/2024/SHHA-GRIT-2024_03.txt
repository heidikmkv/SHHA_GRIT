The  reports of the Association’s Board Officers, and Committee Chairs are  printed in this month’s GRIT for the benefit of members not in attend- ance.                     2024 Annual Meeting Reports of Officers  President: Roger Hagengruber    I was elected president of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  at the December 9, 2020, Board meeting and took office after the 2021  Annual Meeting. The Board asked me to continue to serve as President  for an additional year and I agreed. That year is coming to an end, and I  will be leaving the presidency. It has been an honor to serve as Presi- dent for 3 years and to participate on the Board and a committee for  nearly 5 years.     SHHA has some 1800 members and comprises almost 2200 properties.  There are 39 units in Sandia Heights, each with separate covenants,  and that number will change from time to time as new developments  seek to join SHHA as a unit. We have two full time employees that staff  our office at San Rafael and Tramway.    Our Board of Directors meets monthly, and the various committees  meet separately approximately monthly as well. Two of our committees,  Covenant Support Committee (CSC) and the Architectural Control Com- mittee (ACC), have new chairs and are especially busy approving plans  submitted by owners (ACC) and enforcing the covenants (CSC). It is dif- ficult to give proper appreciation to the chairs and members of all our  committees. This is especially true for the ACC and CSC where so many  volunteers give so much of their time. We all owe them our gratitude.    The SHHA Board is always interested in adding new members. If you  have an interest in joining the Board, please let a Board member or the  office know. We will be asking the membership of SHHA to approve  some new directors at this 2024 annual meeting.   … Continued on page 2  2   The GRIT – March 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 3    …continued from front page 1  Yearly notes:   o We are in good shape financially with all bills  paid on time and adequate insurance and bank- ing arrangements.  We needed to increase our  dues to $15 per month this year to cover ex- penses which went up. Our Tram ticket cost also  increased to $10.00, which remains a bargain  compared to prices at the Tram. Thanks to the  increased dues and Tram ticket costs, we will fin- ish the year with adequate finances. Our dues re- main low compared to other homeowners’ asso- ciations.    o In the office this year, we lost Betsy Rodriguez  to retirement after 14 years and Angela Moreno  returned to Sandia National Laboratories. We  were fortunate to add Trish Lovato as Lead Ad- ministrator, Holly Sylvester as Administrator, and  Diane Barney as Office Director who stepped in  to help overhaul our payroll and office practices.  Our current office situation appears stable and is  functioning very well thanks to an excellent  staff.    o Our committees handled hundreds of approvals  for property modifications and many covenant  issues, a number involving our SHHA attorney.  This represents a large workload and is a notable  accomplishment. Unfortunately, we are experi- encing a significant number of covenant viola- tions that are not readily resolved.    o After a careful review of the NM Homeowners  Association Act (NM Statutes Section 47-16-3), it  has become apparent that all property owners in  Sandia Heights are required to be members of  SHHA and therefore to pay dues. This require- ment was confirmed by our attorney after care- ful review of the Act. The number of homeown- ers who are not currently dues-paying members  of SHHA is about 15%. We are in the process of  notifying the non-paying homeowners of the re- quirement and giving all until January 1, 2025, to  comply.    o A review of our SHHA bylaws is almost com- pleted and we expect to schedule a special  meeting of the SHHA membership to approve  the new bylaws later this calendar year.    o Our website has been reengineered to provide  all members with much improved access to com- munity documents.       Vice President: Hugh Prather    The Vice President’s role is primarily a supporting role  for the Executive Committee and the Board of Direc- tors. The VP oversees coordination of the monthly  Executive Committee meeting and leads monthly  meetings when the President is not available.    The Vice President also chairs the Nominating Com- mittee. This past year we pressed forward the con- cept of having Board and Committee recruitment as  a year-long initiative and not just a year-end strat- egy. We continue to recruit excellent people to  serve on our committees and Board. But we have  many tasks for these excellent volunteers and our  pool of available personnel is sometimes thin.    We recorded a Zoom video facilitated by the Vice  President of an informational panel discussion of five  Board members who discussed in a Q&A format vari- ous aspects of Board member service and the roles  of the various committees. That explanatory video is  now available through our website under Announce- ments -- https://1drv.ms/v/s!Ao0bMJGXwuB0g_8_O- EDq6ksCh6f_w    All new Board members approved by the Board dur- ing the year were provided with training that is re- quired by policy and statute. Each was provided with  a Board of Directors Handbook.    The long-standing Board of Director’s Handbook was  reviewed by all new Board members. Based on their  input on what was found useful and what was not,  the handbook is in the process of being redesigned  to include relevant statutes such as the New Mexico  Homeowners Act, Homeowner Associations §47–16  and the New Mexico Nonprofit Corporations Act  §53–8. Additional helpful tips on being a better Board  member are being included.     3   The GRIT – March 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 3    The other major initiative we fully implemented this  year was a Consent Agenda to streamline our Board  meetings and provide optimal time to focus on our  most urgent and upcoming initiatives. In essence, a  Consent Agenda is one motion that approves all elec- tronic meeting reports that the Board has received  and reviewed since the last board meeting. This Con- sent Agenda eliminates the need to have numerous  time-depleting oral reports that are looking back- wards on activities over the past month and allows  the Board to have more time for conversations per- taining to future priorities and ways to improve the  SHHA.      Secretary: Martin Kirk    I was elected Secretary of the Sandia Heights Home- owners Association at the December 9, 2020, Board  meeting and took office after the 2021 Annual Meet- ing. It has been an honor to serve this past year and  to be voted by the SHHA Board to serve one addi- tional year.     o As Secretary, I serve on the Executive Commit- tee, which meets on the 1st Wednesday of  every month.    o As Secretary, I work with the Communications  Committee to approve content of The GRIT.    o I performed the following functions in accord- ance with the By-Laws:  • Oversaw the preparation and approval of  the Board meeting minutes.  • Certified the presence of a quorum neces- sary for the proper conduct of business at  each Board meeting.  • Ensured the preparation and publication of  the notification for the Annual Meeting.  • Ensured that SHHA’s Official Records Book  is properly maintained and is on file at the  SHHA office.  • Reviewed and approved the format and  monthly printing of The GRIT    o Performed additional duties as needed by the  Executive Committee and the Board in gen- eral.    o Researched and presented as a member of the  E&S committee my findings about safety,  crime, and ingress/egress traffic issues in San- dia Heights     Treasurer/Finance Committee Chair: Randy  Tripp    2023 Budget Results    The estimated Gross Income was $393,160, ex- penses were $342,103, resulting in a Net income of  $51,057.    2024 Budget    Each year the Finance Committee reviews income  and expenses to facilitate making recommenda- tions to the Board for their decision.  Projections do  change during the course of the year; current de- tails may be found on the SHHA website under the  Finance tab in the Board section.    The budget was reviewed and approved by the  Board at the January 2024 meeting.  The budget was developed based on the current  and projected reserves and  the revenues required to cover the services needed  by SHHA property owners.    2024 projected income is $391,606, projected ex- penses are $387,506, allowing a projected target  Net Reserve of $4,100.    Internal Reviews    Major financial procedures are reviewed annually  to ensure compliance. Categories are payroll,  QuickBooks, dues, petty cash, tram passes, health  insurance, and security. There were no aberrant  findings. Recommendations where warranted were  made.    Please note:  The 2023 P&L and the 2024 Budget  can be reviewed on the SHHA website in the  dropdown menu under the heading, “Associaton”  in the banner at the top of the page.  4   The GRIT March 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 3  JANUARY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Summary of Activities for 2023:  A total of 303 applications were reviewed in  2023; 297 were approved.  The Committee filed a lawsuit against a lot- owner seeking to remove an unauthorized struc- ture. The owner resolved the covenant violation  immediately upon being served with the court  papers, and judgment was entered permanently  enjoining the owner from the same violation.  A suit filed by the Committee in 2022 was settled  after court-ordered mediation in early January  2024. The lot owner agreed to resolve an unap- proved structure by acquiring enough land from  an adjoining neighbor to eliminate a setback vio- lation.  Suit was filed against SHHA and the ACC at the  end of the year following disapproval of pro- posed new construction.      The Committee has begun a review and rewrite  of guidelines regarding landscaping gravel, and  approved colors for concrete driveways and  walkways.  The Committee is in the process of updating  color guidelines for stucco and exterior paint and  trim.

Covenant Support Committee (CSC)    Members: Bob Thomas, Chair Succeeded by Art  Romero; Stephen Baca; Judy Chreist; Stan Davis; Bob  Thomas; Kathleen McCaughey; Vicki Meredith; Jim  Stewart; Joyce Harkwell; Tim Henninger  Functions:  Sandia Heights has Use Restrictions (Covenants) gov- erned by over 39 sets of Covenants, each applying to a  designated Unit within the community. The CSC works  with property owners to enforce these legally binding  documents. CSC provides covenant enforcement  through a formalized process.    Formal complaints are submitted to the SHHA office by  a Covenant Complaint Form found on the SHHA web- site or at the SHHA office. The identities of the com- plainant, the alleged violator, the address, and       the nature of the complaint are considered confiden- tial and available only to CSC members.    Many of the covenants were written in the 1960– 1970 timeframes and do not specifically address  some of the key issues we face today. For some com- plaints, the unit covenants do not cover or address  the alleged violation and there is nothing the CSC can  do to help. We are bound by what your covenants  permit. Only the homeowners in a specific unit can  change their covenants. The SHHA webpage offers  guidance on how to change your unit covenants.      In some situations, the Bernalillo County zoning  Codes and Ordinances are more restrictive than the  SHHA covenants, such as for outdoor lighting, bark- ing dogs, and yard trash. In these instances, we en- courage the homeowner to file a complaint with the  County. The SHHA office staff can offer guidance on  contacting the County.    The CSC meets the first Tuesday of every month at  6:00 PM in the office conference room. If you plan to  attend a meeting, we request that you notify the of- fice 24 hrs. in advance and give your subject matter.  Homeowners with questions or a statement to make  to the Committee are allotted five minutes at the be- ginning of each meeting. Then the meeting goes into  Executive Session to maintain the confidentiality of  CSC business. The CSC Agenda and Minutes are for  internal distribution only.  Summary of Activities for 2023:    There were 75 complaints handled by the CSC in 2023,  including 14 carried over from 2022. This compares to  31 over the previous year. All were investigated by  CSC members and recommendations were made as  to the validity of the complaints and actions to take  for resolution if necessary. Of these, 63 were closed  in 2023. Several complaints in 2023 required legal ac- tions by the SHHA attorney.    2023 Successes and Challenges:    The CSC authored many articles in The GRIT in 2023.  These ranged from reminders about trash bins and     Continued from page 8 …  12 The GRIT – March 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 3      outdoor lighting to details regarding Airbnb-like rent- als, septic systems, and radon testing.      Complaints dealing with trash bins and outdoor light- ing continue to be a large part of the CSC workload.   Significantly, in 2023 the CSC confronted several cov- enant violations dealing with parked RV’s, Airbnb-like  rentals, and invasive elm trees. Many RV violations  were successfully resolved and the RV’s removed, alt- hough with some difficulty in a few cases, and several  are on-going. Unfortunately, two Airbnb-like viola- tions could not be successfully resolved by the CSC  and are 2 now with the SHHA attorney for filing legal  action in District Court.      It appears that Airbnb-like and similar short-term  rentals will be a growing problem in Sandia Heights.  All covenants prohibit the renting of part of a house,  such as a room, but do not prohibit the renting of the  entire house. It is worthwhile noting that two units in  Sandia Heights have recently amended their cove- nants to prohibit short-term rentals of any kind, one  for a minimum of 30 days and another for a minimum  of six months.      Invasive elm trees are an increasing threat to the  community. These trees have matured to heights  that are beginning to diminish homeowner views,  which of course impacts property values. Addition- ally, these trees are producing new saplings at an  alarming rate.   The CSC has very limited authority to  enforce removal of these invasive trees, and so it is  asking for homeowner cooperation to remove the  trees. For instances where covenant violations have  been filed, the CSC has sent “Good Neighbor” letters  asking for neighbors to work together to remove  both the offending trees and new saplings.      The CSC will aggressively enforce covenant violations  of RV parking, Airbnb-like rentals, and is asking for  homeowner help to combat the invasive elm trees. It  is important and necessary for both SHHA commit- tees and the homeowners, together, to endorse the  SHHA dual Mission Statements – preservation of  property values, and maintenance of the environ- ment and unique quality of living in the Sandia  Heights community. The CSC fully supports these  Mission Statements.

Members met multiple  times over the course of the year to review Statements of Interest submitted by prospective board members  and to visit with each in a vetting process to assess interests and areas of service.    In the fall of 2023, a Zoom panel was conducted to interact with anyone who was interested in learning more  about board service and to answer questions. The session was very successful with intelligent questions and  great explanations. Fortunately, there are recorded minutes available for anyone who would like to become  more familiar with the functions of the board and committees. The link is https://sandiahomeowners.org/an- nouncements/interested-shha-board-service-or-committe-member-service.    Six new board members applied by submitting statements of interest and were approved by the board as  members (as provided by the bylaws) during the year. These six are:    Heidi Komkov, Eric Faulring, Kevin Lloyd (who subsequently resigned in December), Phil Krehbiel, Jim Stewart,  Suresh Neelagaru, and Terry Walker    David Crossley, Hugh Prather, Roger Hagengruber, Susan McCasland Wilkerson will be leaving the board at  the end of this annual meeting.    Eric Faulring, incoming VP, will be happy to receive statements of interest from anyone who might be inter- ested in board service.  Community Events Bulletin Board    These groups are not sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Cork & Fork has resumed having bimonthly dinners. We  gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts.  The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of  the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are two whole-group dinners during the year. All  adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Rene Kessel at (505)  504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.     Like to read? Have informed opinions? Long-standing Sandia Heights book club has an opening for one new  member. We are (mostly) retired professionals who read literary fiction and nonfiction. We meet the third  Wednesday of each month in the host’s home. Each member hosts once a year, presenting their book for  discussion and providing snacks. We enjoy wide-ranging, civil discussions. We seldom brawl and never bite.  If interested, please send a note to introduce yourself to Linda Mason    lindamason307@gmail.com.
