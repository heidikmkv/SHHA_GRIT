The board continues to discuss uni- versal membership. I am personally taking the lead on this, and we will be  incorporating to the extent possible the issues broached by our neigh- bors. I believe it is the right thing to do. I will continue to keep you up- dated.    We have welcomed several new board members over the last several  months, and as hoped, they are all considerably younger than I (!!!). Bring- ing the new generation of Sandia Heights residents onto the board was  one of the main goals for my term as your president. So far, so good...    The treasurer and the finance committee are also working diligently to  bring clarity and transparency to our financial affairs. Our CPA has com- pleted a ‘compilation’ of our financial records (think of this as an audit  lite...) to ensure we are in compliance with the NM Homeowners Act, but  also to provide you with a level of comfort that your dues are not being  mishandled. One of the areas in which we will make things clearer is to  definitively list (by issue...) where legal fees are being spent.    Recently, I sat in on the April meeting of the Communications and Publi- cations Committee and was overwhelmed by the level of energy and com- mitment to the SHHA exhibited by Claudia’s committee members. A ma- jor topic of discussion was The GRIT, which in addition to our website, is  the primary means of communication with all of you. It really troubled all  of us to hear a neighbor offer that he and his wife had lived here for six  years and had never heard of The GRIT. This committee came up with  some great ideas that we are going to try out. More to come!    Okay...for a new feature of my column, the monthly ‘rant.’  Please bring  your trash & recycle receptacles to curbside the morning of your sched- uled pick up and — ASAP after pick up — remove them from the  streetside, and place them either in a fenced area or in your garage. This  is important for aesthetic reasons, because it is required by our cove- nants, and especially now, because our resident bears are coming out of  hibernation. For more on this, see the article inside this issue.    …continued on page 2    2   The GRIT – May 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 5    …continued from page 1    Remember our office staff is available five days a week;  please reach out to them via email or a phone call with  your issues or concerns. Of course, you can also reach  out to me at president@sandiahomeowners.org. I  promise you will receive a response. For those of you  who reached out after last month’s issue of The GRIT,  thank you very much.    Jurassic-Triassic Park  Stan Davis    The late Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era was the  Dawn of the Dinosaurs. The colorful Triassic Chinle (CHIN- lee) Formation, in particular, is famous in the American  Southwest for its treasure trove of fossils, including pet- rified wood and New Mexico’s own State Fossil, the  Coelophysis (see-low-FYS-iss) unearthed at Ghost Ranch  in 1881. Mesozoic rocks crop out in abundance on all  sides of the Sandias, except for our side. The sole out- crop is extremely close to Sandia Heights! Drive up For- est Road 333, turn right (east) onto Forest Road 333B,  which leads to La Cueva Picnic area, drive (or walk,  when the barricade is down) for only about one-tenth  of a mile and you will come to a large clearing suitable  for parking. The view to the south and southeast into  the valley below is “red rock” country. If you look care- fully, you will see the earthy red colors extend up and  down the valley, and across to the other side. The origin  of all this red is the upper Triassic Chinle Formation, and  in particular the Petrified Forest Member. The spatial  extent of this outcrop is relatively tiny, as outcrops go,  but its geologic significance amongst academia is huge.     What would someday become New Mexico was “dry”  land during the late Triassic. Or was it? Yes, the region  was land, and it was becoming increasingly more arid,  but the land was crossed by massive river systems trans- porting sediments eroded from highlands in the east  and south to the northwest. These systems included  sediment-laden streams that meandered and braided  across the region, depositing layer upon layer of fluvial  sediments that would eventually become buried and  lithified. Through uplift and erosion, these layers be- came exposed where we can see them today. High-en- ergy stream channels were able to transport coarse- grained sediments, which would become sandstones  and conglomerates, while low-energy flows in       backchannels, flood plains and over-banks carried fine- grained sediments, which would become siltstones and  shales. The reddish fine-grained rocks are soft and fria- ble, and tend to make up the majority of the outcrop.  The somewhat browner, coarse-grained rocks are  found in numerous thin beds up to a few feet thick. They  are more resistant to weathering, so some of them stick  up out of the ground, forming small ledges and walls.       Figure shows a sweeping view of reddish Chinle rocks and  eroded sediments in the drainage with a Sandia Mountains  backdrop (top); a closer view of “Red Gulch” draped with  tan and gray granite gravels and boulders (bottom right);  and a closeup of steeply dipping sandstone beds that are  embedded between red Chinle mudstones (bottom left).    Younger Jurassic beds are also present here in proper  stratigraphic sequence above the Chinle, further up the  main drainage. Both the Triassic and Jurassic beds have  two fascinating characteristics. First, many of these  beds are steeply tilting, or “dipping” in geology lingo.    … continued on page 3  3   The GRIT – May 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 5    …continued from page 2    Many of these beds dip toward the mountains, while  some are even almost vertical. When they were origi- nally laid down, these beds were generally sub-horizon- tal or only gently dipping. Second, these Triassic and Ju- rassic beds rest, in a vertical sense, directly on the San- dia Granite without the intervening older rocks that are  normally resting on granite on the Sandia Crest.     What geologic phenomenon could account for these  phenomena? Hint: it is not an unconformity like the  “Great” one present on the Crest. The short answer is:  faulting. But not just “typical” falling-domino-style fault- ing. The fault here is interpreted by geologists to be  somewhat spoon-shaped, and is relatively shallow and  gently inclined. It is not a typical steep normal (a geo- logic term) fault, but has been classified to be a “Low  Angle Normal Fault.” These kinds of faults have been  studied extensively by academia in Basin and Range  provinces, such as in Nevada, but only a handful have  been identified in the Sandias. They provide evidence of  important processes related to how basins — the Rio  Grande Rift in our case — originally formed in response  to crustal extension. The full explanation is well beyond  the scope here, of course, but has to do with isostacy  (or crustal buoyancy), and can help explain the geo- graphic asymmetry of the Rio Grande Rift sub-basins  (such as the Albuquerque Basin) and even the asymmet- ric profile of the Sandia Mountains. How fortuitous it is  that this outcrop has not been completely buried by  granite gravels or eroded away altogether so that it can  be seen and investigated. It’s fascinating to think how  this humble little outcrop of Mesozoic rocks, so close to  home, has been extensively studied by geologists to  help understand regional crustal-scale tectonics.     Isn’t He Cute?  Environment and Safety Committee    Are you feeding the Sandia Heights wildlife? Are you  leaving your garbage bins outside, including putting  them out the night before garbage day?     Then you may be responsible for the lethal removal of  bears, or worse yet, an altercation with a bear leading  to human injury. Bears are attracted to high-calorie           human-provided food sources including garbage,  bird/deer feeders, and food/treats for pets. Intention- ally feeding bears is illegal.    Unfortunately, once bears know about a non-natural  food source they keep coming back and can lose their  fear of humans. Mother bears may also teach their  young about such food sources, habituating them to hu- mans and setting the stage for future conflicts. The  most important action we can take is to remove food  and other bear attractants. The NM Department of  Game and Fish does not relocate but lethally removes  bears. Removing the bear and trying to relocate is not  feasible. Long-distance relocation attempts are typically  unsuccessful due to strong association with non-natural  food sources once bears have become habituated. Re- habilitators can’t effectively un-teach bears any human- food associations that they’ve learned. Also, when  there’s food available, other black bears will show up.                                    Let me take the garbage out when I’m done with it.  (Image from the Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife)    Black bears are NM’s state animal. They become active  from mid-April to mid-November. Remove all attract- ants, such as bird seed, pet food, empty food contain- ers, and kitchen scraps in garbage bins. Bears can smell  food from over a mile away. Don’t leave your garbage     … continued on page 7  4   The GRIT May 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 5  MARCH CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Put them inside your closed garage, and  contain them until the morning of pick-up. Pick your  fruit trees as they ripen, and remove fallen fruit. Don’t  leave anything edible in cars parked outside. Be a friend  to bears!  Deer, too!  Ok, so you’re not feeding the bears, but the deer. That’s  not good either. Feeding and attracting the deer brings  in other wildlife, making them more vulnerable to pred- ators, and at risk of spreading disease. Deer are the pri- mary prey of mountain lions. Also, feeding wildlife that  usually is calm and docile can cause them to become  more aggressive over time, and cause harm to people in  the area. Wild animals also can carry diseases dangerous  to humans. Deer will not starve in the winter when  there appears to be no food. They naturally decrease ac- tivity and movement and utilize their body fat, browsing  on natural available vegetation. Feeding them is not in  their best interest. Unnatural diets can actually cause  disruption in their digestive systems and decrease their  chance of survival.    Tramway Trash Pickup Scheduled this Month  Kathleen McCaughey, E&S Committee Chair    There will be a community trash pickup along Tramway  on Saturday, May 11.  All volunteers are welcome. Meet  at the SHHA office parking lot (SE corner of Tramway  and San Rafael) at 8:30 AM.  Many hands make light  work!         The Scoop on Gravel  Architecture Control Committee    When Sandia Heights was first envisioned by its found- ers, their goal was to create a development that, as  much as possible, would maintain the natural beauty  and ecosystem of the Sandia Crest foothills. One way of  doing that was to avoid disturbing the natural vegeta- tion, and to site homes and roads so that it all would  blend in with the existing terrain. A desirable byproduct  was to help preserve habitat for wildlife so that resi- dents could all share in the excitement and wonder of  living side by side with the natural world. Quite a differ- ent ideal from the usual housing development!    Our covenants and guidelines exist to carry on that vi- sion: “landscaping blends with its surroundings,” “in- crease the habitat available for wildlife,” “natural vege- tation be left undisturbed where possible and replen- ished after construction,” “landscaping shall minimize  visual encroachment on open space and the  streetscape,” etc.     The overuse of gravel and similar materials in landscap- ing runs counter to these ideals. Accordingly, to clarify  the guidelines for homeowners, the Architectural Con- trol Committee is adopting the following revisions to  the guidelines governing the use of gravel and concrete  in Sandia Heights. Guidelines have to be flexible enough  to cover all properties, whether large or small. They also  need to respect the special environment that drew us  all to Sandia Heights.     The use of gravel, rock, or crushed or decomposed gran- ite, or similar materials for landscaping purposes, in- cluding mulch, should be kept to a minimum (400  square feet or less is recommended) and located adja- cent to the house or driveway, so as to preserve the nat- ural look of the area. Large expanses of gravel and sim- ilar materials (including concrete) produce excessive re- flected heat, disrupt wildlife habitat, and are not in har- mony with the natural surroundings of Sandia Heights.  Use of river rock or similar materials to control erosion  is permitted in all areas where it is required, although  native plants should be interspersed within the rock ar- eas to assist in stabilizing the soil and to improve the  aesthetics of rock areas.    … continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – May 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 5  … continued from page 7    Excessive use of gravel: Gravel or other similar materi- als, including mulch, is not to be completely substituted  for natural vegetation within view of the street. Addi- tionally, covering an entire property with gravel or  other similar materials, including mulch, is contrary to  the spirit of preserving the natural beauty of the Sandia  Heights environment, whether the yard or area is  smaller than 400 square feet or not, and will not be ap- proved. In particular, native vegetation should be used  to enhance gravel or similar material areas, particularly  on the streetscape.     Color of gravel, rock, or decomposed granite:   The in- tent and purpose of the Sandia Heights covenants is to  enhance, as much as possible, the natural ambience of  the area. Careful consideration should be given there- fore to the color of gravels chosen; there are any num- ber of naturally colored gravels that blend well with our  environment. Unnatural colors such as black, white,  red, orange, or light grays will not be approved as being  contrary to the spirit of the covenants.    Flatwork: Concrete or pavers may be used for walk- ways, driveways, and patios provided it is colored to  avoid glaring white or off-white colors once cured.  Earth-toned colorants are readily available from con- crete contractors.    Tumbleweed Alert!  Claudia Mitchell    NOW is the time to be on the alert for those awful, inva- sive tumbleweeds.   Pull them while they are small and  easy to deal with.  It is a Bernalillo County ordinance to  control noxious weeds and, boy, are these guys nox- ious.  For detailed information on tumbleweeds, you  can refer to articles on tumbleweeds in the July 2021,  August 2022 and September 2022 issues of The GRIT. It  is easy to access these online.

What the artist  chooses to put into that cup results in an almost seren- dipitous piece of unique art. It is called “fluid acrylics,”  and Sharon has become captivated by the endless pos- sibilities.        Sharon and her husband moved from central Wiscon- sin to Sandia Heights about five years ago. They  wanted to retire to a place with seasons, but not quite  as extreme as central Wisconsin! They considered Flor- ida, but one of her two sons was married to a gal from  Albuquerque, and he said they should check it out. Ten  years ago, they had visited Albuquerque during the Bal- loon Fiesta, so they took another look. When the retire- ment date was imminent, Sharon was tasked with find- ing “the” house in Albuquerque. Her husband sent her  alone with the instructions that it must have a view and  must be able to handle his beloved pool table. With her  daughter-in-law’s real estate agent, Sharon spent five  days looking at homes in the northeast heights. At al- most the last moment, they found Sharon’s current  house. When her husband saw it, he said enthusiasti- cally, “You did a good job!”    About a year before their move, during an exploratory  visit to Albuquerque with her sister-in-law, Sharon saw  the signs for the Sandia Heights Artists Tour, and they  visited several stops. Sharon recalls, “It was so cool.”  Once she relocated here in 2019, she looked into how  she could get involved. It was too late to participate  that year, and the 2020 tour was cancelled due to  Covid, but in 2021 Sharon hosted as a tour stop and  showed her art to the public for sale for the first time.  “I was scared, but the members were very encourag- ing and supportive. I did well. I was astonished and  happy!”    Sharon was astonished because she had never thought  of herself as an artist. She is a retired nurse, and she  told me that she had wanted to be a nurse for “as long  as I can remember.” But Sharon had a son who had  been drawing and making art since he was four and  eventually earned an MFA. She also had a dear friend  who had a degree in interior design. That friend did  many artistic things and encouraged Sharon to catch  the art bug by taking her to “Wine and Paint” events.  That did not take, but one day they went to a loosely  organized fluid acrylic class that was only $20. Sharon  told me with a gleam in her eye, “It just GRABBED me!”   She went home and immediately set aside a little space  in the furnace room in the basement and started  watching YouTube videos voraciously. That was eight  years ago. “I am self-taught,” Sharon told me. “I call  my interior design friend my ‘muse’ because she al- ways encouraged me in artistic endeavors and finally  led me into my creative calling.”        …continued on page 12  12 The GRIT – May 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 5    … continued from page 11    Sharon makes her magic-in-a-cup in her garage work  area. The acrylic paints are mixed with a medium and  carefully poured into a cup in layers. The canvas is put  on top of the cup, and the whole thing inverted. The   paints flow as they will onto the canvas. As she showed  me where she makes her pieces, she told me about her  love for her medium. “I can’t explain it. I just love the  fluidity of it---how the movement of the paint and the  colors work together. I like the abstraction of the  forms and how it stimulates the imagination. The  paints, like a river, flow where they want to, and you  do not know exactly how a “pour” will turn out.”    As she explained some of the chemical recipes involved  with different paint-mixing media, I could see that it  was not as easy as it sounded. She talked about specific  swirls of the paints called “lacing” and “cells” and in- corporating other materials and media to embellish  her work. She was excited to try more techniques and  experiments.     “It has been a creative outlet for me, as a caregiver, to  express myself in ways I never had before. I just love it  when people like what I have done. When I give a piece                   to a friend, I feel as if I have given a piece of myself.  When acquaintances say to me, ‘I didn’t know you  could do that.’ I say, ‘I didn’t know either! ‘”  Sharon’s work can be seen and purchased at the San- dia Heights Artists Tour September 7-8, 2024.

Be an Affiliate Member of Sandia Heights Artists  Sandia Heights Artists President, Mara Malnekoff    The Sandia Heights Artists (SHA) is a group of resident and guest local artists that hosts an annual studio  tour here in Sandia Heights. It is a twenty-plus year tradition, reaching art lovers from our neighborhood,  Albuquerque and beyond. It will be held September 7-8 this year. Being a member of the SHA requires that  you apply, abide by our artists’ agreement, and participate in the tour by showing your art and engaging  actively in the extensive work required to mount the event each year.     This year the SHA has created a new affiliate membership. These members may participate in SHA meetings,  exhibits, and non-sale events, with the exception of the studio tour. Affiliate members must live in the Sandia  Heights neighborhood as defined by the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. The annual fee is $20, and  no application is required.      This is an excellent opportunity to meet local artists and see what the tour is all about. It is a way to learn  about this event and decide if you want to participate in the future.

That is not always the case. Some dog  walkers will approach a non-dog walker remarking,  “Oh, he/she just wants to say hello. She/he’s very  friendly!”  Actually, not all non-dog walkers want to  meet your dog. There have been some not-so-friendly  encounters between the dog walkers and the non-dog  walkers. Unfortunately, there was an instance where a  dog on an extendable leash bit a person with no seem- ing provocation. This incident necessitated a visit to ur- gent care for attention to the wound and a shot.                                 Dogs can be a problem when allowed to roam off-leash.  Bernalillo County has leash laws. Most of our residents  follow these laws. However, once again, an unfortunate  instance occurred where a neighbor’s dog dug up the  other neighbor’s irrigation lines, damaged plants, and,  of course, pooped. The dog-owning neighbor offered to  pay for damages, but the now-destroyed native wild- flowers had been nurtured and prized for years and  were essentially irreplaceable.     Tragically, unwelcome encounters involving unleashed  dogs can be dangerous to other leashed dogs, resulting  in severe injury and even death of the beloved leashed  pet — both of which have occurred in Sandia Heights.     So, dog owners/walkers and non-dog owners/walkers,  let’s respect each other’s rights. We can all walk our  beautiful roads and trails respectfully and in harmony.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small  dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the  hosts. The host decides the menu theme and pre- pares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun ra- ther than formal elegance. Though most of the din- ners are smaller, there are two whole-group dinners  during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents  are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call  Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at  rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
