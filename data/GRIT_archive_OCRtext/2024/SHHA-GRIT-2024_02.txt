We  will meet in the lower-level fellowship hall.   Don’t miss this opportunity  to meet your Board members. We invite every resident to attend. Ques- tions are encouraged and can be submitted up to a week in advance uti- lizing the question form on the SHHA website under the “Announce- ments” tab and on page 12. You can drop the form by the office, mail it,  or email it. The deadline for submission is February 17.  Let’s shape the  future of Sandia Heights together.  We look forward to seeing you there.                        Some Changes for 2024  Roger Hagengruber, President SHHA    Let me start by wishing all a Happy and Successful New Year. It would  be a notable year if there could be peace in the Middle East and Ukraine  as well as other regions of conflict.  I am writing this article to make all our Sandia Heights residents aware  of changes that will be happening this year. More information regarding  these changes will be available at our annual meeting on February 24.  You are all encouraged to submit questions for the SHHA Officers and  Board.  The form and instructions for submitting questions is now avail- able on our website.     Topic 1: Universal membership  During our review of the Homeowners Act (HOA) (NM Statutes 47-16-3)  to ensure that we are following its provisions, it became apparent that  we are not complying with the provision regarding membership in  SHHA. The act requires all property owners to be members of SHHA. We  asked our attorney to review the requirement and he confirmed that the  provision applies to SHHA and Sandia Heights.  Currently, about 15% of our property owners are not SHHA members and  therefore do not pay monthly dues. This situation is not allowed under  the HOA. We are in the process of notifying non-members of the legal  requirement to become members and pay dues.   … Continued on page 2  2   The GRIT – February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2    Changes, continued from front page…  Obviously, since all property owners benefit from the  work of the committees to ensure compliance with the  covenants and to protect the environment, ambience,  and property values, it is only fair that everyone shares  in the costs via dues.  The Board recognizes that this provision of required  membership will come as a surprise to those people  who have been non-members for years, so we are de- laying implementation of the requirement to January 1,  2025. During this year, we will be communicating with  non-members via mail to make people aware of this le- gally required change. Hopefully, all our non-member  property owners in Sandia Heights will understand our  position and comply with the change.  Topic 2: Damage Assessments  The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) has respon- sibility for ensuring that new construction or other ex- ternal modification of existing dwellings in a unit are  done in conformance with the covenant that applies to  the unit. Residents planning to build or modify are re- quired to submit applications to the ACC for approval.     The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) is responsible  for addressing covenant violations submitted to the  committee by residents.     Both the ACC and the CSC begin dealing with violations  by courteous letters and/or committee member visits or  phone calls. The intent of these initial “soft” contacts is  to respectfully achieve compliance. Currently, if the soft  approach fails, the committees have the SHHA attorney  send a letter explaining the need to comply to avoid le- gal action that could end up in court. Use of these mech- anisms usually ends up with compliance without a legal  filing. However, on occasion our attorney ends up with  a case. These legal actions are expensive and of late  there have been an increasing number of costly litiga- tions.    The committees and the Board believe an intermediate  tool is needed between the “soft” approach and legal  action. We are considering creating a damages assess- ment schedule to be applied in situations of non-compli- ance. A property owner’s correction of a non-compli- ance would result in damages being waived, but failure  to correct a problem would cause damages to accrue  that could result in a lien on the property.     This proposal will be discussed at the annual meeting as  the Board seeks input from our membership. Any com- ments or suggestions you may have can be sent to the  SHHA office.    Topic 3: Bylaws update  Work on revising the SHHA Bylaws is underway; the  membership will review and vote on them later this  year.     Topic 4: Website Improvements  The SHHA website has been reengineered to be more  user-friendly and to offer easy access to community  documents.      Topic 5: End of term as Board President  I will be leaving the Board after the annual meeting and  will end my third year as SHHA President. It has been an  honor to serve the membership as president.    New Q&A Approach at Annual Meeting  Your Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  (SHHA) Annual Meeting is on February 24, 2024. As in  the past, you will have an opportunity to ask questions  about any aspect of the Association.  The Q&A section of the meeting will be after the  business meeting when you elect your board and hear  officer and committee reports. In the past, questions  were often submitted at the meeting itself. One prob- lem with this was that several complex questions  needed additional research before they could be an- swered. This has led to the new format for the Q&A sec- tion.  On page 12 you will see the Annual Meeting Ques- tion Form we will use this year. You will note in the in- structions section at the top, the questions must be sub- mitted in advance and received no later than February 17,  2024, so that the responder has ample time to clearly  and comprehensively respond to your question.  You may submit paper versions by hand at the  office, or submit them as attachments to an email to  shha@sandiahomeowners.org.  The Question form is on  the website at www.sandiahomeowners.org. under “An- nouncements.” You may still submit written questions  at the Annual Meeting, and we will respond in writing as  soon as we can after the Annual Meeting.

Break- Refreshments provided by O’Bean’s  Community Forum on Universal Membership  and Damages Assessment Policy  Members are invited to ask questions and share opin- ions regarding the topics of Universal Membership and  the Damages Assessment Policy under consideration by  the Board of Directors. Speakers will be limited to three  minutes per recognition by the President.   Adjournment  3   The GRIT – February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2  SHHA Contractor Evaluation Program:  a tremendous resource in the SHHA office  from the Editor, Claudia Mitchell  You have probably heard about fraudulent contractors  here in Albuquerque and elsewhere. They especially like  to target more upscale neighborhoods. Unfortunately,  such a scam recently occurred right here in Sandia  Heights. The homeowner found who they thought was  a reputable roofing contractor who was not in the  SHHA office contractor book. After prudently checking  out the three references he had supplied, the home- owner awarded him the job. Subsequently, his “repair”  to their roof created a substantial leak which caused the  collapse of their bedroom ceiling on December 23rd.  The entire debacle resulted in significant extra ex- penses and inconvenience, not to mention the stress in- volved. The homeowner is planning to pursue legal re- course once they have a solid roof over their head.   The homeowner reached out to the GRIT editor,  requesting this reminder to all Sandia Heights home- owners urging them to take advantage of this readily  available resource. Just come on into the office to check  out this book before you award a job to a contractor.   AND, if you have credible, reliable work done by some- one you have hired, help them and your neighbors by  filing out a page recommending them in the book. It  takes little effort. You can find the form under the “Ser- vices” tab in the blue banner heading at the top of the  home web page at www.sandiahomeowners.org. Fill it  out and bring it into the office for the reference book.  It could help a neighbor and thwart an unethical con- tractor.   Outdoor Lighting: SHHA Covenants  and Bernalillo County Ordinance  from the Covenant Support Committee  The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) commonly re- ceives complaints about outdoor lights that are very  bright and shine onto nearby properties and even into  neighbors’ windows. Among many pleasures of living in  Sandia Heights is the dark night sky that allows stargaz- ing, watching the moon rise over the mountains, and  enjoying the distant sparkling city lights. This was a qual- ity-of-life issue considered by the original developers of  Sandia Heights. The GRIT periodically publishes articles  to remind homeowners and residents about the re- strictions on outdoor lighting imposed by both the  SHHA Unit Covenants and Bernalillo County (BernCo).

One way we want to do this is through organizing  special community events. In 2022 we hosted a Mem- bership Appreciation event with live music, a food  truck, face-painting, giveaways, and several local ven- dors promoting their businesses. In 2023 we co-hosted  with the Environment & Safety Committee a Neighbor- hood Afternoon Out / Ice Cream Social. Our local fire  department, sheriff’s deputies, and Sandia Heights Se- curity were with us; we had games and ice cream sun- daes on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon in the park.    What can we do in 2024 and beyond? In the past year  or two, residents have suggested a community-wide  garage sale, an Easter egg hunt, a Trunk-or-Treat, a  Christmas decoration contest, and an ice-skating party.  These are all great ideas.    We also could join up to do service projects in our own  neighborhood or beyond. What about a Town Hall  meeting or an informational session with local politi- cians or foresters? Is this your kind of passion? Do you  have suggestions?     Could you volunteer to help with just one event that  interests you?     If you would like to help brainstorm, make phone calls,  write up blurbs for The GRIT, put up signs, set up, clean  up, or otherwise organize a social or service event, call  or email the SHHA Office soon! (The budgeting process  for most events takes several months.) Neither the  Board nor the CS&M Committee has the man- or wom- anpower to do it without your help.         How can I shut off my water supply?  By Sandia Peak Utility Company    As we have previously notified our customers, Sandia  Peak Utility Company is in the process of installing new  intelligent water meters in Sandia Heights and Prim- rose Pointe. With the installation of the meters, ques- tions have arisen from homeowners as to how to shut  off the water should a leak occur, or maintenance be  needed on the property.     It is the homeowner’s responsibility to make sure that  the water is shut off when a leak occurs on their prop- erty with their own independent shutoff valve.  Sandia  Peak Utility Company Rules approved by the Public  Regulation Commission require that all homes have  shutoff valves.  The Uniform Plumbing Code in more re- cent years also requires new residential residences to  install a shutoff valve.     Some homeowners may not know where their shutoff  valve is located, and some older homes may not have  shutoff valves. If you do not know where it is located  or do not have a mainline shutoff valve, please contact  your plumber to help locate yours or to have one in- stalled for your emergency use. If you happen to have  the plans to the home, they may depict where the  shutoff valve is installed.     It’s important to know the location of your mainline  shutoff valve and periodically exercise it to ensure it  functions correctly. Older shutoff valves which have  not been exercised may experience leaks. Having this  knowledge can be crucial in emergencies or when per- forming plumbing maintenance to prevent water dam- age and conserve water.    As a public utility it is our duty to be concerned about  security and threats to the water system.  Please note  that Sandia Peak Utility does not allow customers to  access the water meter can. The customer’s mainline  shutoff valve on your property is the recommended  means of turning off your water when needed. The me- ter cans will remain locked in order to protect our cus- tomers and the Utility Company’s meters, communica- tion devices and associated plumbing within the meter  cans from unwarranted access, tampering or vandaliz- ing of the electronics of the meter, and from unwanted   … Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT –February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2                                                                                                                                                                                          ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:     442 Live Oak Loop -- RV Garage/Attached Addition  453 Live Oak Lane -- Roof top Solar Array  673 Bluebird Lane -- Add Pergola/Grill Cover  753 Tramway Lane -- Re-roof with Tan TPO  1101 San Rafael Ave -- Replace HVAC Unti  1159 Laurel Loop -- Re-roof with Tan TPO/Re-stucco  1188 Laurel Loop -- New Water Line  1466 Morning Glory Road -- Re-roof Tar & Gravel  1533 Eagle Ridge Road -- Landscaping  1866 Tramway Terrace Loop -- Re-roof with Tan TPO             leaks. If the meter or components are damaged during  unauthorized attempted access, there may be a charge  incurred for the necessary repairs or replacements of  the Utility Company’s equipment.      As mentioned, we realize that for various reasons  some of our customers may not have a working shutoff  valve.  If you have an emergency and currently do not  have a working shutoff valve, immediately communi- cate with Sandia Peak Utility by calling 505-856-6419  during regular business hours, Monday thru Friday or  for after-hours emergencies call 505-888-5336.  A crew  member is always on call to respond promptly, and we  have also trained Sandia Heights Security to assist us  when a crew member may not be in the vicinity.     As a secondary emergency response, the following is a  list of local, licensed plumbers that are available for  24/7 emergencies:   • TLC Plumbing & Heating: 505-761-9644  • Wagner: 505-805-2962  • Albuquerque Plumbing & Heating: 505-349- 4404  • Day & Night Plumbing: 505-974-5797  These plumbers can also be solicited to provide shut- off valve installation for customer use.      Snow on granite  Elizabeth Edgren, Sandia Heights resident     Our grandsons have just  visited us from western  Washington state, and we  took them out on walks in  the foothills every day.  From the first day, when  the five-year old called out  in wide-eyed amazement to  his brother, “Look, John! A  boulder!” to this very after- noon in the snow, I was re- minded that we live in a  wonderful place. That first  boulder  was  barely  a  stone’s throw beyond the trailhead at the top of Cedar  Hill Rd, and they just kept getting bigger and            better. Each one was a wonder, begging to be climbed.  I was skeptical about walking the trail in the snow to- day, but the granite rocks (per Stan Davis’s article in  the May ‘23 GRIT, I may call them granite even if they  are more accurately called something else) are still  mostly “grippy,” even under a bit of snow. Between  climbing snow-dusted rocks, making snow angels at  the trailhead, and scooping snow from alongside the  trail to throw at their papa, the boys had a grand time.  What a joy to share this place with far-away family.                                                                                                                                              Water Utility, Continued from page 7 …    9  The GRIT – February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2 10  The GRIT – February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2 11   The GRIT – February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2      Although exact wording may differ between  the Covenants for different Units, typical wording  states that no unshaded flood lights shall be maintained  which cause light to shine directly into the homes of  other residents. Traditional-type flood lights are availa- ble in different styles nowadays, but even more con- ventional outdoor light fixtures with bare bulbs that es- sentially “flood” light indiscriminately in multiple direc- tions are considered a violation of the Covenants. The  Covenants, which may be found at https://www.san- diahomeowners.org/association/committees/cove- nant-support-committee/unit-covenants, try to accom- plish the same purpose: minimizing the effects of out- door lighting on one’s neighbors. SHHA members may  file a lighting complaint online at:  https://www.san- diahomeowners.org/csc/violation-report  or visit the  Office to obtain a form.   In addition, the North Albuquerque Acres and  Sandia Heights Light Pollution Ordinance of BernCo  Code Article VI, Section 30-186 states, in part: All out- door light fixtures shall be designed and operated as cut- off or shielded aimable fixtures equipped with and con- trolled by light and motion sensors or automatic timing  devices, and shall remain off between 11:00 PM to sunrise  except for illuminating walkways or driveways.     “Shielded” means a method of construction that causes  all the light emitted from an outdoor light fixture to be  projected below a horizontal plane passing through the  fixture. “Shielded aimable” further means a method of  construction that causes all the light emitted to be di- rected to the surface or area to be illuminated, so that  the emanating source of light is not visible form any an- gle except those angles that exist between the fixture  and the target to be illuminated; the emanating source  shall not be visible from any adjacent properties or road- ways to minimize light pollution.    This BernCo ordinance is modeled after the  1999 New Mexico Night Sky Protection Act.  More de- tailed information can be found at the BC Municipal  Code  library  online:    https://library.munic- ode.com/nm/bernalillo_county/codes/code_of_ordi- nances?nodeId=BECOCO_CH30EN_ARTVILIPO. When  a lighting complaint is submitted to the SHHA, it is rec- ommended that a complaint also be submitted at the  same time to the BernCo website under “Planning and  Development Services, Online Services”:  https://www.bernco.gov/planning/online-services/  There the user should select “File a Zoning Complaint,”  although at the time of this writing this link was not  working. Alternatively, or perhaps as a follow-up, a  complaint can be submitted by calling BernCo at 505- 468-7777 and asking to speak with Planning and Devel- opment Services.   SHHA CSC only acts upon written complaints  from homeowner SHHA members. If you receive a for- mal complaint about lighting on your property but see  lots of other properties with bright outdoor lights, that  may be because those homeowners have not received  complaints. Most homeowners who have received for- mal complaints were not aware their lights were violat- ing Covenants and County ordinance and bothering  neighbors and residents, and most have been happy to  comply by addressing the situation. Others have com- plied, perhaps begrudgingly, but so far litigation to en- force compliance has never been necessary. Any  changes you make to your outdoor lighting needs to be  approved by the Architectural Control Committee  (ACC), and an application to do so can be found online  here:  https://www.sandiahomeowners.org/associa- tion/committees/architectural-control-committee/ap- plication.  When considering outdoor lighting, a quick read of  the GRIT article (online) by Bob Bower-May 2019,  “Light Talk” is helpful especially concerning bright- ness, particularly their temperature – how lower-Kelvin  (K-rating) bulbs that provide yellowish light are less ob- trusive than higher K-rated bulbs that give off blue- white light. Another great reference is the GRIT article  by Eric Haskins, Architect and SH resident, August 2022,  “Blinded By the Light”, which further elaborates on  color temperature, and provides a useful list of recom- mendations, some of which are abbreviated here:  • After dark, turn on all your outdoor lights and  assess how they appear from the street.  • Ensure your lights do not shine directly into  neighbors’ yards or windows.  • Ensure your lights do not shine up into the sky;  lights should be aimed below the horizontal.   • Ensure your lights, even if aimed below the hor- izontal, do not shine into neighbors’ properties  and windows that may be located downhill.  • Ensure your light fixtures do not contain bare  bulbs that can be seen via direct-line-of sight  from any direction.

As romantic as that may  sound, what prospector would hang around the eco- nomically ore-poor Sandias long enough to build a  sturdy 3-room, thick-walled stone cabin, complete with  plumbing, an outdoor stone fountain, a long perimeter  stone wall and a 16-step stone staircase leading up out  of the arroyo? Actually, according to Sandra Arazi- Coambs, Forest Service Archaeologist, the original part  of the cabin was part of the Jacobo Garcia homestead  ranch. Jacobo is believed to be related to, and perhaps  the son of Cosme Garcia, who also owned a nearby  homestead ranch, starting in the early 1900s, which  was situated in the very northern part of what has be- come North Sandia Heights. Juan Tabo Cabin was later  used as an administrative office by the Civilian Conser- vation Corp (CCC) when a very large camp was situated  here and occupied by the CCC in 1933-34 and then by  the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through  1942. The small north room was added on during this  period. Whereas the wooden barracks and other build- ings for this camp are mostly long gone, the impressive  stone structures are still standing.   The Cabin is located not far up Forest Road 333  and can be reached by parking in a lot about half a mile  up the road, and following the arroyo trail a short dis- tance. The durable stone-and-mortar construction is  truly impressive, and well worth taking a visit. The  stones are mostly bowling-ball-and-larger sized boul- ders that were locally sourced: granite from the San- dias (see The GRIT, May 2023) and metamorphics, such  as schist and gneiss, from the Rincon (The GRIT, Au- gust 2023). The cabin’s original rooms included the  large main room and an adjoining bathroom, and were  constructed mostly of metamorphics, but they also in- clude some granite, mainly in the south-facing walls;  the newer small north room was constructed with all  metamorphics. Using this description and the pictures  provided on p. 15, the visitor can figure out what types  of rocks make up the large staircase, water fountain  and perimeter wall. There are even some small stone  steps, which led into some of the wooden barracks,                                                     … Continued on page 15  15   The GRIT – February 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 2  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.    *************************************************************************************      still hidden in the arroyo brush. Early  ranch life in the Rincon certainly must  have been challenging, grimy and ex- hausting. But the builders seem to have  had the foresight to place two stone  benches flanking the front door on the  west-facing side of the cabin. There the  ranchers and CCC-ers might have sat to  rest, sit and to watch glorious sunsets  after a long day of work. Now that’s ro- mantic.

Community Events Bulletin Board    These groups are not sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Cork & Fork has resumed having bimonthly dinners. We  gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts.  The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of  the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are two whole-group dinners during the year. All  adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Rene Kessel at (505)  504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.     Like to read? Have informed opinions? A long-standing Sandia Heights book club has an opening for one  new member. We are (mostly) retired professionals who read literary fiction and nonfiction. We meet the  third Wednesday of each month in the host’s home. Each member hosts once a year, presenting their book  for discussion and providing snacks. We enjoy wide-ranging, civil discussions. We seldom brawl and never  bite. If interested, please send a note to introduce yourself to Linda Mason    lindamason307@gmail.com.     Sandia Heights Services text alerts. Sign up to stay informed!
