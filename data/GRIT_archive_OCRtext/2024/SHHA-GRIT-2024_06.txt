I am personally  taking the lead on this. It is fairly clear that your board cannot impose the  requirement to pay SHHA dues; that will require unit-by-unit covenant  amendment(s). But the board believes establishing all residents as mem- bers is doable and the right thing to do. More to come...    Once again, I had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting of the Communi- cations and Publications Committee. A continuing topic of discussion is  The GRIT, which in addition to our website, is the primary means of com- munication with all of you. I continue to hear from our neighbors that  they were unaware of, or did not bother to read, The GRIT. Any sugges- tions you might have to broaden the distribution of The GRIT, please send  them forward.    A new initiative on the part of your board is to recognize long (and self- lessly...) serving board and committee members. The first two awards  went to Dave Crossley and Hugh Prather for their years of service (ten  years between the two of them...) to the SSHA Board.    The monthly “rant.” No one is more aware of the limitations presented  by our community roadways for walkers than me, as I am often wander- ing about with the Princess on the leash (or maybe it’s me on the leash!)  as we are out for our constitutional(s). It might seem counterintuitive to  some, but you are much safer walking against the traffic rather than with  it. Most drivers are very respectful of us walkers but looking them in the  eye as they approach is far better than having them coming up from be- hind. Please note the small article in this issue underscoring the im- portance of walking on the left. The article was inspired by an anonymous  concerned resident, and I enthusiastically support their request.    Remember our office staff is available five days a week; please reach out  to them via email or a phone call with your issues or concerns. Of course,  you can also reach out to me at president@sandiahomeowners.org. I  promise you will receive a response.     …continued on page 2    2  The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6    …continued from page 1      Recipients of the President’s Award:  Hugh Prather (L) and Dave Crossley (R).

Based on an Anonymous Request to the Editor      Susie and Lynn Scheller, practicing being both neighborly  and safe as they walk down the left side of the road.    When you’re out walking or jogging, with or without a  pet, stay on the LEFT side of the street, facing oncoming  vehicles. This way you can see them better to get out of  the way if necessary. We can’t always hear a vehicle  coming up behind us, and cannot see how they are driv- ing, whether they see us and are giving us pedestrians  space. When we’re on the left, we can see and react  more safely.    Shredding Event Saturday, June 29th  8:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.  Community Service & Membership Committee  As a benefit to our members, the CS&M Committee is  hosting a free shredding event at the Sandia Heights Vil- lage Shopping Center (where our SHHA Office is lo- cated).  By Hands Unknown  Stan Davis    This title is taken from a publication by the Archaeolog- ical Society of New Mexico (1986, Anne Poore, ed.). In  that publication and in a prior one from 1984, Phyllis S.  Davis writes about the Cosme Garcia homestead, which  was a 57-acre ranch located in and above the Jaral Can- yon (canyon of the sandbar willow thicket) in the Sandia  Mountains foothills.      These papers describe and document field research  conducted by the National Forest Service and the Albu- querque Archaeological Society between 1978-1981. The  relatively small Jaral Canyon is not to be confused with  the other Jaral Canyon located in the Rincon hills north  of Forest Road 333. The lower part of the canyon of in- terest here divides the northern and southern portions  of North Sandia Heights. Cosme Garcia was a relative of,  and perhaps the father of Jacobo Garcia, who is be- lieved to have owned the homestead where Juan Tabo  Cabin is located (see The GRIT, Feb. 2024). Cosme moved  to Jaral Canyon in 1900 (or 1902) but did not apply for a  homestead patent until 1914, which was eventually is- sued to him and his wife, Melecia Lusero de Garcarca in  1923. Figure 1 (next page) shows how the original home- stead outline on the early survey plat is preserved  within the section/township/range land survey system.  Essentially, it shows how the homestead occupied what  would become almost the entire northern portion of  North Sandia Heights.     Life on this homestead was influenced by the whims of  nature. While nearby springs and ephemeral streams  provided water (as evidenced by willows and cotton- woods), only a small fraction of the land was ever culti- vated for growing crops, some of which were irrigated,  and even then, some years were total failures. Small    …continued on page 3  3   The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6    crops of beans, corn and chile were supplemented with  the gathering of piñon nuts, acorns, seeds and fruits.  The main use of the more elevated, rugged, rolling por- tions of the land was for sheep or goat grazing, but even  that endeavor might have been seasonal.           Figure 1:  The original survey plat (top) shows the outline  of the Cosme Garcia homestead. The map of the modern  Section/Township/Range boundaries (bottom) shows how  the original 57-acre boundary is preserved as the “L11”  block that interrupts the more uniform arrangement of typ- ical 40-acre “quarter-quarter” section blocks (such as the  ones labeled “NENE” and “SENE”). Roads and houses of  North Sandia Heights are visible, showing how almost all  the northern part of NSH falls inside the old homestead.    With the property owner’s permission, I visited the main  building site, which is located on an undeveloped lot on  a flank of the canyon, to see for myself how the various  homestead structures are faring (see Fig. 2). While the  homestead structures were already observed to be in  an “advanced state of deterioration” in the late 1970’s,  they have deteriorated considerably more since then.    The original site included a two-room, two-window  house, adjoining covered porch, corral, loading chute,  chicken coop, garage, and other amenities. The site also  included two stone tanks for capturing water piped in  via gravity drainage from the nearby springs – a system  noted as an “outstanding feature” of the homestead.  The foundations of the main house and porch and the  tank walls were constructed of local granite stones. In  one of the rooms the stones were chinked with adobe.  These stones are still present, although tumbling into  ruin, while only a small amount of adobe in the founda- tion is still present.         Figure 2: Closeup of the interior of a portion of some of  the foundation walls of the ruins, showing a small amount  of adobe that still remains (top). Two wooden posts that  were part of the sheep ramp still stand (bottom left), in  large part because they are embedded in concrete. A con- temporary photograph from P. Davis (1986) shows the  main house still standing, with stone walls, adobe brick  walls, and wooden roof timbers (bottom right).     The main house walls were built of stones but also of  adobe bricks, and although these were still standing in  the 1970’s, the stones have fallen, and the adobe bricks  have all been washed away. Wooden posts still stick up,  including one in the corral area and two that mark the  sheep ramp (loading chute). Other artifacts still present  include old metal fence posts, barbed wire, baling wire,  and small metal pieces of various sorts. Many other  types of artifacts observed in the 1970-80’s, including  corrugated metal roofing pieces, stamped metal ceiling  panels, wooden sluice boxes, buckets, jars, bottles,  cans, glass, even a hot water tank and a stove, and other  items appearing to have been mostly picked over. With  foresight, Phyllis Davis lamented thirty-eight years ago:  “With the homestead now part of a large residential com- plex, it can be expected that the cultural remains … will  not survive much longer, and another element of New  Mexico’s colorful history will disappear forever.”   APRIL CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Don’t throw away that plastic bag, old worn-out  wool sweater, or back issues of the New York Times  Magazine. Bring them to Deborah Griswold, and she will  turn them into beautiful and useful works of art.       Deborah grew up in New Mexico and went to New Mex- ico State University, where she met her husband, a na- tive of Socorro. They had moved to Dallas for their  work, but in 1995 decided to move to Albuquerque  where they had family. With two little boys, aged two  and four, they were looking for good schools — and, be- ing from flat featureless Dallas, they wanted a view.  They found their current home here in Sandia Heights,  which checked the boxes for both. However, their  house was only a foundation with months to go to com- pletion. They decided to stay in an apartment for a while  rather than compromise either of their goals.    Deborah was raising her children and working in her ca- reer as an engineer for the Department of Energy. She  served for several years as the secretary of the board of  the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. She was a  busy woman. She had seen the signs for the Sandia  Heights Artists Tour and just could not make the time to  participate. But her desire to create was waiting for an  opportunity.    Deborah grew up in La Mesa, New Mexico, home of the  famous Chope’s restaurant. Her family had an ethic of  not wasting anything. “I come from a family that just  doesn’t believe in waste. They taught me, ‘Use it up.  Wear it out. Make it do or do without.’” Her grand- mother made rag rugs and quilts out of the family’s old  clothes. That influence made Deborah an early environ- mentalist who, even as a child, was interested in reduc- ing waste. Her family also loved art and even on vaca- tions visited art museums. Her mother was a painter.  Deborah loved art and considered studying art as a ca- reer, but her mother gave her sage advice, “It is easier  to become an engineer and be an artist than to become  an artist and be an engineer.” Deborah took that advice  and earned a degree in chemical engineering, but her in- terest in the arts remained in her peripheral vision. “I  was always doing crafts and wanting to do more artistic  things.” She took watercolor and jewelry classes with  her mother and made jewelry and gave it to friends.     The two boys grew up and Deborah retired. Those en- ticing Sandia Heights Artists Tour signs led her to visit a  tour stop three years ago just across the street from her  home (Sharon Arendt, interviewed in the May article) to  see what it was all about. Deborah decided to join the  group. That was a kickstart to Deborah’s artistic endeav- ors.       Deborah Griswold    She has studied watercolor and wants to pursue it, but  currently her main interest is jewelry and personal  adornment. Her medium is, well, pretty much every- thing that she can upcycle into things completely differ- ent and beautiful. She gives a whole new meaning to  the term, “mixed media.” She creates beads out of  rolled thin paper (her favorite paper is from the New  York Times magazine) and combines them with decon- structed old jewelry, buttons, and even copper wire  gleaned from motor coils, into one-of-a-kind bracelets,  earrings, and necklaces. She unravels old wool sweaters  and felts the yarn into hearts that are incorporated into  unique pieces. She crochets and sews recycled yarn and  fabric strips into decorative rosettes.      Deborah’s creative urge takes her in many different di- rections. She transforms old wool sweaters into felted  material by repeatedly washing them in hot water, dry- ing them and fashioning them into decorative, but use- ful, items such as eyeglass cases. She crochets plastic  bags into baskets that are then embellished with bor- ders and accents of VHS tape. She crochets with T-shirt  yarn — yes, created from discarded T-shirts.    …continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6  …continued from page 7    She is inspired by envisioning what she could make out   of what others usually see as a piece of trash. “The me- dium tells you what you can do with it. I love to take old  things and give them a new life!” Her latest project is  taking cuffs from men’s old shirts and transforming  them into unique embellished bracelets.    “I am a work in progress,” Deborah told me. “I am still  growing and figuring things out. I think artists have a  natural urge to create something meaningful and beau- tiful. I get great personal satisfaction out of making  things of beauty out of objects that would go into the  trash. I experience joy in the process. Look at what can  be done to make something beautiful that wasn’t.”      Deborah’s work can be seen and purchased at the San- dia Heights Artists Tour, September 7-8, 2024.    Ariel Foster  Often, we wake up after having a vivid dream full of im- ages and colors. We want to remember it, but the more  we think about it, the more it slips away.  Ariel Foster  makes art that is like that: vivid, full of images, and with  an elusive meaning that might slip away if over-ana- lyzed.    Ariel was born in Oklahoma, and she moved with her  family to New Mexico at an early age. Art and music  were woven into the fabric of her Roma heritage. On  her father’s side, everyone in the family was required to  play an instrument — they were from a long line of cir- cus musicians — and he played trombone. Her mother  was a singer. Ariel grew up with the expectation that  you would be artistic in some way because that was        “what was needed to live a good life.” Her parents and  grandparents encouraged her to try artistic things and   not to worry about how “good” it was, but just to see  what it was like. When she was nine, her father pre- sented her with a trumpet, and even though she really  wanted to play oboe, she played that trumpet. As a mat- ter of fact, she soon played it so well that her parents  had the expectation that Ariel would become a profes- sional trumpeter.      Ariel Foster and her assistant, Merlin     Years of lessons and practice went by. Ariel went to  New Mexico State University at Las Cruces, earning a  degree in music with trumpet as her instrument.  She  was very good and went on to pursue a graduate de- gree in trumpet performance. She practiced countless  hours. To make ends meet, she taught trumpet and  played gigs. Just short of her graduate recital, she real- ized that a career as a professional trumpeter was just  not for her.    She returned to Albuquerque and was very happy to  find a home in Sandia Heights. She realized that more  than anything she missed her music students and teach- ing them. Following a friend’s suggestion, she decided  that she wanted to work with children with learning dis- abilities. She got a post-baccalaureate teaching degree  and went to work teaching eighth-grade special educa- tion language arts. After seven years at Madison Middle  School, loving what she does, she has determined that  she “will never do anything else.”    …continued on page 11  9 The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6 10   The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6    11   The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6    ...continued from page 8  Leaving the continual pressure of graduate music stud- ies, Ariel found a re-awakening of her artistic interests.  Ariel’s parents, true to their involvement in music and  the arts, had severely limited their children’s access to  TV and computers. As a child, Ariel had ample time to   pursue low-tech interests. She loved to draw and when  she was eleven, she started a sort of online drawing fo- rum during the little time she was allowed access to a  computer. In between hours of trumpet practice, she  earnestly followed the course and progressed from  graphite pencil to colored pencil to watercolor pencils  and, eventually, to watercolor paints. She found that  she LOVED color, and she loved the unpredictable way  that watercolors worked. She wanted to use every  color every time and developed a “colorful chaotic way  of looking at things.”      Now, as an adult liberated from the arduous discipline  of serious musical study, Ariel fell back in love with wa- tercolors. She did not have to control everything. She  was able to “let go of power and let the water media  take on a life of its own. I get to be surprised!”   Soon  she enhanced her watercolors with the serendipity of  collage, using images and letters never printed from  the internet but discovered in hard-copy sources. Now  freed from the strict structures and confinements of  music where a wrong note can be a disaster, she could  revel in the creative process where a “wrong” turn can  be creative serendipity. “When I start an art piece, I  may not know where it is going. It is very spontaneous  and rapid. It just kind of happens. It is all over the place  when it is in process and then…it is DONE!  I do not go  back to work on it again and again.”    “Art does not have to be as ordered and sensible as  music. It is like when you try to tell a dream. Often the  best way to express those dream images and feelings  is not a linear story. There are holes. It is not perfectly  structured. It is nice to have a venue where you can   give this a space to exist and breathe. Art can do this.  Art is fundament to the human experience.”    Last year, Ariel joined the Sandia Heights Artists and  participated in her first show after seeing the pink San- dia Heights Artists signs on Live Oak. She has become  involved in the group and looks forward to the tour this       year. “My art is very personal. It is about telling stories.  I do not create with the ‘public’ in mind. Nothing is for  everyone.”                            Ariel is a sought-after trumpeter in Albuquerque and  still does the occasional gig. Jazz is her venue. Ariel’s  art can be seen and purchased through her Instagram  account: @tealadyarts. Ariel will be exhibiting at the  Sandia Heights Artists Tour, September 7-8, 2024.    Historical Highlight: The Story Behind an  Iconic Photograph  By Claudia Mitchell as told by Burt O’Neil  Communications and Publications Committee    Burt O’Neil is a retired Air Force pilot who flew gun- ships in Vietnam and F-4 Phantom jets in Florida. He fi- nally landed, so to speak, at Kirtland AFB in 1980 where   he engaged in training to become an optical engineer.  He and his wife loved the views from Sandia Heights,  which at that time, was pretty much “in the country”  with no paved Tramway Road nor Paseo Del Norte  Boulevard to access it. They still live in the house they  built here in 1982, in which they raised three children.  When Burt retired from the Air Force in 1985, he began  serving on the Sandia Heights Homeowners Board, and  for years chaired the Communications and Publications  Committee — on which he is still a member.     Burt had considerable computer programming skills  and, in 2006 he found the Sandia Heights website in a     …continued on page 12  12 The GRIT – June 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 6    …continued from page 11    “mess.” He obtained the funds to pay for an office  staff member to go to CNM and take a course in web- site programming. As her term project, she totally re- wrote the SHHA website into a coherent up-to-date  whole. At last, in 20o7, The GRIT was published on the  website in full color. It was hoped that putting The GRIT  on the website would replace the expense of the  monthly mailing. However, some folks preferred the  printed black-and-white edition and, to this day, The  GRIT, although available on the website, is mailed to  those member homeowners who request it. The SHHA  website was maintained by the office staff until 2012  when SHHA contracted with our current web devel- oper.     Although the website and The GRIT on-line edition  were in full color, for nine years The GRIT and the web- site homepage languished with only the grayscale San- dia Heights graphic logo for their nameplate. Burt, an  avid underwater photographer and self-described  “colorist” knew the nameplate could be much more at- tractive and more accurately set the tone for the  unique mountain view that characterizes Sandia  Heights. In 2016, he decided to remedy this. He set his  camera up on a tripod on his east patio and created a  digital panoramic scan with the most advantageous as- pect ratio, shutter speed, and exposure. What resulted  was the iconic image of the Sandia Crest that residents  have come to associate with the website and The GRIT:        What makes this photograph even more personal are  the branches that grace the left side of the picture. In  1987, Burt’s four-year-old daughter had decorated her  very own Christmas tree, a little Scottish pine in a pot.     When the season was over, Burt intended to throw out  the baby plant, but his daughter wanted to plant it out- side. Burt told her to go ahead but warned her that it  would probably die. His daughter is now a practicing  physician in Bernalillo — and the tree is over twenty  feet tall, happily living in Sandia Heights with only the  run-off from a canale to water it.  Trash Collection Help for Those  with Disabilities  Community Service & Membership Committee    Sandia Heights Services, our sanitation services pro- vider, offers special assistance for residents who are   physically unable to move their trash bins to the street  on their collection day.    Go to the Sandia Heights Services website, Refuse Col- lection Policy | Sandia Heights Services.  Towards the  bottom of that page is a link to a printable form for  their Disability Assistance Program. The form requires  your name, address, and phone number, as well as a  section for your medical provider – a chiropractor (DC),  naturopath (ND), physician or surgeon (MD or DO), po- diatrist (DPM), or an Advanced Registered Nurse Prac- titioner (ARNP) – to verify that you need assistance.    When complete, you can mail, email or fax a copy to  Sandia Heights Services. (One of your dues-paying mem- bership privileges is free fax services at the SHHA Office!)    Be a Trail User, Not a Private Property Abuser  Based on Anonymous Request to Editor    One of the many reasons we love living in Sandia  Heights is because of the proximity of the well-main- tained trails and picnic areas in the foothills of the San- dias in National Forest Land. Within a short distance we  can even be in a nationally designated Wilderness Area.   We are doubly fortunate to have county parks along  Tramway. Many homes in Sandia Heights back up to  National Forest land or border county parks.     As noted on page 17 of the Sandia Heights 2024 Resident  Guide and Directory, there is no public access to any of  our county parks, forest land, nor picnic areas through  private property.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small  dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the  hosts. The host decides the menu theme and pre- pares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun ra- ther than formal elegance. Though most of the din- ners are smaller, there are two whole-group dinners  during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents  are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call  Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at  rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
