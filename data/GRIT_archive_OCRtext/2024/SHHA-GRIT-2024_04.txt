I must admit I am pretty excited to have been given  this opportunity.    I come to Sandia Heights from Texas where I grew up, and where I landed  after serving in the Army for over thirty years. Post Army, I was involved  with public safety — training jurisdictions how to prepare for emergencies  — and in law enforcement, where I served as the Chief Deputy Sheriff for  Brazos County. Now I reside amongst you because of the love of a woman  who wanted to retire in Albuquerque, in particular, Sandia Heights. In con- trast to most of you, I am a veritable newbie having resided here full time  for a little over two years. But in that short time, I have been very involved  in our association, serving on the Architectural Control, Covenant Support  and Finance committees. This has provided me with the opportunity to  see the association from the bottom up.    I tried to introduce myself to everyone who attended the annual meeting  in February, and I listened to our neighbors speak about issues that are  important to them. Listening is one of the key skills for any leader, and I  have worked diligently on perfecting that skill. I learned that there are  some things that we (the board…) could have done, including a better job  of listening and communicating with all of you. I can assure you that effec- tive communications with you is one of my priorities. One vehicle will be  this message to you, which I intend to include in every issue of The Grit.    Our vice president, Eric Faulring, leads the nominating committee and is  always looking for residents who want to serve on the board and our com- mittees. Please reach out to him with your interest…I promise you that  your efforts will be rewarded, and you will have a great time with the folks  serving with you.    Our office staff is available five days a week; please reach out to them via  email or a phone call with your issues or concerns. Of course, you can also  reach out to me at wstewcol@msn.com. I promise you will receive a re- sponse.    2   The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4    Household Radon Mitigation  Stan Davis, Covenant Support Committee Member    Radon household awareness was previously discussed  in The GRIT (August 2022). That article discussed the  origin of household radon, how household radon can be  measured, and what the controlling factors are on fluc- tuations and magnitudes of household radon. This arti- cle discusses household radon mitigation. Much can be  learned about radon mitigation online, so this article  mainly serves to illustrate what common mitigation sys- tems look like, using what was done by a local contrac- tor for my house as an example. Note that very-short- term mitigation can be achieved simply by opening win- dows and doors, after which radon levels can plummet  quickly inside the house. However, radon levels will rise  just as quickly once windows and doors are closed. This  approach is not always convenient or practical. There  are two main types of radon mitigation systems — ac- tive and passive.     Active radon mitigation systems employ an electric ex- haust fan to draw soil gases from below the foundation  out to the open air above the roof. The main compo- nents are shown in Figure 1.         Figure 1: A trench for a “dual” approach (1A), the entire  visible stack (1B) and close-up of exhaust vent muffler  (1C).       Initially a hole is excavated in the dirt next to the foun- dation outside the house. Then a horizontal conduit is  bored through the foundation stem wall, behind which  (and under the slab) a cavity is hollowed out in the dirt.  PVC pipe is laid horizontally through this conduit and  connected to “elbows” or “T’s” routing to a vertical  riser pipe outside the house. Figure 1A shows a “dual”  approach, where a trench was dug to accommodate  two horizontal conduits leading to a single riser. The  riser feeds into the electric fan component. This fan is  enclosed within a housing that is not designed to be ac- cessed by the homeowner, and the fan must run contin- uously 24/7 for radon mitigation to be effective. The  hum from the fan can be an issue, but recently some  manufacturers have been designing new fans that are  significantly quieter than older brands or models, so it is  worthwhile ensuring you are installing the quietest res- idential fans available. The gases are then pushed up  through a tall riser that leads above the roof (and above  the parapet, if one) to be exhausted. The entire stack  that is visible above ground is shown in Figure 1B. Figure  1C zooms in on the top of the exhaust stack, showing an  exhaust muffler to quiet the rush of air. This attachment  significantly reduces the sound coming from the stack,  and should always be installed. Note that a non-insu- lated PVC “elbow” on top of the stack will not reduce  the noise, but rather will focus it in the direction the el- bow points. This should go without saying, but if you are  ever up on your roof, don’t put your mouth and nose  over the exhaust and inhale! The amount of radon com- ing out of the exhaust stack is orders of magnitude  larger than what is seeping through the foundation into  your home. A good approach to installing active mitiga- tion systems is to do one at a time, to see if a single sys- tem is sufficient at reducing radon to acceptable levels  throughout the entire house; if not, additional systems  can be installed in strategic locations, one at a time, un- til radon levels are acceptable. A reputable contractor  will probably advise this approach. Another approach to  active-type radon mitigation might be to integrate an  Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) into your HVAC sys- tem (if you have one), perhaps the next time your HVAC  is replaced. Because an ERV brings fresh air in from the  outside, this approach should further assist in reducing  household radon.    … continued on page 3  3   The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4    …continued from page 2  Passive radon mitigation systems do not employ a radon  exhaust fan, but can usually be retrofitted to be an ac- tive system if the passive approach does not appear to  be effective. Many counties and municipalities across  the country appear to be requiring passive systems, at  least, to be installed in new residential construction.  This approach draws sub-slab soil gases to a collection  point and then up an exhaust pipe to be vented above  the house, relying on a pressure differential to do so. If  you are building an addition onto your house, you may  want to consider installing a passive system, as illus- trated in Figure 2 for the case of a new addition with a  concrete foundation. Soil gas collector mats are laid out  in a grid fashion directly onto the prepared soil (Fig. 2A).  When the foundation is complete, soil gases will move  through the mats to a single collection point, where  they pass through a “T” riser (Fig. 2B). The concrete  foundation is poured on top (after all the other sub-slab  plumbing has also been installed, of course) (Fig. 2C). A  riser will then be installed to go up between the walls  and through the roof, where the gases will escape. An  electrical supply should be installed nearby on the roof  as well, in case, at a later time, it is decided to install an  exhaust fan there. In summary, household radon, which  can pose a health risk, is an issue that can be addressed  for new and existing homes.       Figure 2: Black soil gas collector mats (2A, only part of  the grid is shown here), T riser sticking up through blue  rigid foam insulation mats (2B), and T riser sticking up  through the poured concrete foundation (2C).       The Artist Next Door  By Claudia Mitchell    Wax, textured paper, and an iron are just three of the  items that Barb Boedeker uses to make her original art  pieces. But I am getting ahead of our story.    Barb grew up in Wisconsin. She did not know exactly  what she wanted to be, but she knew that she loved art  and after high school graduation she attended the re- spected Layton School of Art in Milwaukee. Barb met a  recent graduate from the Air Force Academy who was  home on leave, and he became her husband. Soon after  they were married, they journeyed to his first assign- ment at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks by driving  up the then unpaved Alcan Highway in their Austin Hea- ley with wire wheels. “It was quite an adventure,” Barb  told me with a wry smile and a chuckle. “It was not the  right car for Alaska but later we sold it to an Alaskan.”          Eventually, Barb had three children occupying her life.  Her art took a back seat though she still attended vari- ous art classes exploring different media including pas- tels and batik. “I was never sure what would inspire  me.” So, she kept exploring. Barb’s husband’s final as- signment at the end of twenty years was Kirtland AFB.  They found that they really loved Albuquerque and  would have stayed on, but her husband got a good job  offer back in Wisconsin. They decided it was best to re- turn to their home state. Back in Wisconsin, Barb  learned a remarkable fact. Her sister, while researching  their family history, discovered that their great-great-  grandmother was a Potawatomi named Wishtayouka.  This new knowledge about her family ignited a feeling  of connection and interest in American Indian culture     … continued on page 7  4   The GRIT April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4  FEBRUARY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Over the years living in Wisconsin, they found  they missed Albuquerque. After ten years, her husband  convinced his firm to open an office here and they hap- pily returned. After looking at many houses, they found  their current residence in Sandia Heights. “We loved the  views and still do,” Barb told me as we looked at the  mountain. “We have made a lot of changes to it in thirty  years.”    Upon returning to Albuquerque, Barb’s children were  pretty much grown. Barb began spending more time  with her art. She had a reawakening of her deep per- sonal connection to and interest in American Indian cul- ture and art. That interest broadened to encompass  many ancient art forms. She had always been drawn to  texture and she was particularly intrigued by primitive  art on stone and pottery—petroglyphs, Mimbres pot- tery motifs, European paleolithic cave pictographs. “Be- ing in the Southwest again made me want to learn more  about the art and history of this region. I was amazed  by all primitive artists—especially that they could be so  expressive with so little. It was interesting to me that  primitive peoples all over the world are interested in  creating beauty.” She began painting images inspired  by these sources. She experimented with wax resist  techniques to create backgrounds complementing the  images. Her approach was unique. She brought some of  her work to the original Weem’s Gallery in Albuquerque  and, to her surprise and delight, they accepted her  work. She is still showing there.    Barb began to participate in the extensive annual  Weem’s Artfest at the Expo. She enjoyed having con- tact with her buyers—an experience that is missing  when selling through a gallery. She had an amazing ex- ample of that experience when someone bought one of  her works at the Artfest depicting spotted horses. The  buyer put Barb in contact with a professor in France  who specialized in paleolithic cave art. Barb and her hus- band arranged a trip to France, met the professor, and,  with a select group, toured seven cave art sites. At the  famed Pech Merle cave site in southern France, Barb  was able to see the actual 25,000-year-old cave painting  of the spotted horses that had inspired her. It was cos- mic synchronicity. Remembering the experience, Barb  said quietly, “The horses were larger than I imagined. It  was a magic moment. It was a highlight of my life. After     seeing the painting, I could not speak. I still get emo- tional talking about it.”    After a few years, the Sandia Heights Artists Tour be- gan. Barb was part of the early founders but became  too busy to continue. She began exhibiting again at the  Tour this year. “It has come a long way and become  much more professional.”        Barb’s art continues to evolve. Her passion for texture  has led her to explore handmade papers of all kinds and  she now builds and wraps her frames in imaginative  ways that enhance her work.  For the one-of-a-kind  backgrounds in her paintings, she works with wax  melted in the kitchen and uses an iron in ways that go  far beyond her early batik class. She has developed a  multi-step process through “trial, error, and experimen- tation. I am never sure exactly how it will come out.”    Making art is only one of Barb’s many interests. She  plays bridge, plays golf, gardens, and explores estate  sales, repurposing and refurbishing her finds. “Am I re- ally an artist?” she mused. “In some ways, I do my art  for myself rather than for others. When you put your art  out there you are sort of baring your soul. I am very  grateful when someone buys it.”    Barb’s art can be viewed and purchased at Weem’s Gal- lery in Albuquerque, and she will be exhibiting in the  2024 Sandia Heights Artists Tour.    Mark your calendars!  The 21st Annual Sandia Heights  Artists Studio Tour will be September 7-8, 2024.    … continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4    … continued from page 7    A gnarled, half-buried root, a rotten fence post, thawed  and refrozen snow caught in a canvas depression— these are things few would recognize as the material or  subject for an objet d’art. Lars Strong has created works  of real beauty from these humble items.        Lars is a third-generation New Mexican who grew up in  Tesuque. His mother, an accomplished artist, worked at  the venerable Shidoni bronze foundry in Tesuque,  which existed solely to cast artistic works. It later ex- panded into an art gallery and sculpture garden until its  closure earlier this year. His mother sculpted on a large  scale. Her work can be seen in Santa Fe and New York.  He remembers her working on her sculptures. He was  so familiar with the processes involved that he led  foundry tours for visitors when he was 10 years old. His  mother married Charlie Miner, the highly accomplished  glass artist, and Lars learned about the world of glass.  Steeped in this world of sculpture, Lars developed a  strong ability in 3-D visualization and had a natural abil- ity with tools. He told me that he was “always making  things.”  He was an avid whittler. “I put some stitches in  my knee whittling,” he told me wryly. Growing up  among artists in the beauty of the Tesuque countryside,  he discovered a love of natural elements and a creative  drive.        Lars earned a degree in civil engineering at New Mexico  State University in Las Cruces. He went to work for a  civil engineering firm in Santa Fe. Eventually he changed  his focus to data center cooling optimization engineer- ing, the specialty he currently works in. That job  brought him to Albuquerque about seven years ago. He  was “looking for a house as close to the Sandia Moun- tain as I could get.”  He found his current home in Sandia  Heights and revels in his mountain and valley views  every day. A year after he saw signs for the Sandia  Heights Artists Tour he began participating in the tour  and has continued ever since.     Lars’ creative drive and passion has always been close  at hand. “I am always playing and creating things.” His  natural ability with tools led him to take a course in  wood turning at Santa Fe Community College about 15  years ago. He began working with wood and stone. His  art is not easy to categorize. Using natural materials, he  enhances the characteristics of the object with precise,  detailed tooling and other alterations. “I am often col- laborating with and accentuating the natural form that  is already there. Other times, I have a vision for a partic- ular form and think ‘how can I do that?’  I figure out a  process that is sometimes simple and sometimes com- plex. Sometimes I have no idea where I am going. I  work, I set it down, and I may not pick it up for years.  Other times, I know exactly where I am going.”    Recently, he has renewed a love of photography which  he learned in high school. Being an avid skier, hiker, and  outdoor explorer, he is often immersed in the natural  world, and there is not much that does not catch his  eye. “I am always looking for creative moments.”  He  showed me some well-crafted photographs utilizing  time lapse, light painting, and unusual lighting; and it  was clear that he sees those “creative moments” nearly  everywhere. “Some of my best shots have been in my  front yard.”    I told him that he is an eclectic artist and he replied, “Ap- parently!”  We laughed. He explained that he creates art  for two reasons: to create a vision that he has, and to  spend time in the process of exploring the form. “I am  striving to get to Beauty. I am looking for that potential.  When a shape reveals itself just right, it becomes obvi- ous that it is beautiful.”    … continued on page 11  9 The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4 10  The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4   11   The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4    … continued from page 8    “I have no message, no agenda. I resist giving my pieces  names because I do not want to lead people in any di- rection. They can just go wherever they are going to go.  My art gives people an opportunity to have an experi- ence they would not have otherwise. One of my favorite  moments was when someone picked up one of my  pieces and said, ‘This makes me unreasonably happy.’ ”    Lars’ work can be viewed and purchased soon on his  website www.Larsstrong.com and he can be contacted  at lars.strong@gmail.com. Like Barb, he will also be  showing his work at the Sandia Heights Artists Tour in  Fall 2024.

Where are you, little bird with cheerful early-morning voice?    I scan the trees out my windows.    Binoculars at my eyes, bird book at hand, I search.     Where is flutter or quivering throat?    Uphill or down? On the ground?     Perched on tree tip, or hiding within?    Do you sing on the wing?     Ah! Hello, Mama Quail. I know your voice.    Hush, pause; let the little ones speak.    The birds are there, varieties unmet.    I want to see; I want to know.    Patience. Be still. Listen. Watch. Wait, quiet and ready.    In time they'll appear all unexpected and lovely,    All surprising, still or swift,    Certain of fresh today, no burden of yesterday's toil or grief.    Solar Electric System Do’s and Don’ts  Bob Bower, ACC Member     I want to share with you an article published by PNM in  their “energyworks” flyer that was included with their  monthly billing statement for February.  The ACC, over  the past decade or so, has approved the installation of  many rooftop photovoltaic (PV) solar systems  throughout our community.  This particular PNM arti- cle has some useful tips to consider before you make a  decision to install a PV system on your residence.  If you  have any additional concerns beyond what is included  in the article, PNM can be contacted at their website,  https://www.pnm.com/Solar .     The “Do” List:   • Watch for credentials of anyone selling you so- lar.  PNM does not sell rooftop solar systems  and will never send someone to your door try- ing to sell you solar.   • Be cautious with anyone knocking on your  door—ask for identification and who they work  for.   • Get quotes from at least three vendors and read  the terms of the contracts.   • Learn about federal and state tax rebates and  how to qualify.           • Check your address to verify your feeder has ca- pacity for solar at https://www.pnm.com/Solar.  • Ensure your contractor includes you on the so- lar application so you receive important com- munications and notifications from PNM.   • Right-size your system based on your average  annual usage.      The “Don’t” List:   • Don’t sign a Power of Attorney allowing your  contractor to sign contracts or agreements on  your behalf without first consulting an attor- ney.   • Don’t oversize your system—you’re paying for  something you aren’t benefitting from.   • Don’t let your contractor install the system  prior to PNM approval.  PNM is required to issue  a valid permit for the installation of a PV system,  and you can ask your contractor for a copy of  this permit.  (Editor’s note:  Contractors should  also have a copy of the Bernalillo County per- mit.  This covers aspects of the solar installation  described in Bernco Solar-Install-Reqs.pdf).     …continued on page 15  13  The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4 14   The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4  15 The GRIT – April 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 4    continued from page 12…    Based on our experience here in Sandia Heights regard- ing PV systems, the ACC has heard some “horror sto- ries” regarding unscrupulous contractors who sell  poorly engineered and poorly performing PV systems.  Choose your contractor carefully. The SHHA office  maintains a list of residents’ feedback and comments re- garding their experiences with a variety of contractors  including those who install PV systems. Take advantage  of that data to help you with your decisions.    Spring Winds Bring Heightened  Wildfire Danger  Cheryl Wieker, E&S Committee    Many people have a mental picture of what a wildfire  looks like. A dense forest of tall swaying pines burning  in a solid line comes to mind for a lot of us. In March, we  watched with horror as the largest wildfire in Texas his- tory consumed over 500 homes and a million acres in  the Texas panhandle. Not forests; plains. Not tall trees;  prairie and brush. The Texas panhandle fire showed us  once again that the combination of high winds and low  humidity can bring devastating wildfires – regardless of  the topography. Those same weather elements swept  right through Albuquerque on their way to Amarillo.    Sandia Heights can have similar “fire weather” and this  month is the time to get your home and family ready to  prevent losses. Take the following steps this month to  stay safe:    • Remove dead brush from around your home. Even  if you love the look and smell of Chamisa, it dies  back in the winter and is a powerful fuel. Remove  any Chamisa that is growing near or under your pi- nons and juniper trees. Cut back Chamisa growing  30 feet away from the house and reduce clumps.  • Clean up sticks, twigs, pine needles and other de- bris that blow onto your roof, canales, gutters and  patios. These little piles of debris become “tinder”  for the sparks, embers, and firebrands that spread  the fire from yards to your houses. Move firewood  piles at least fifteen feet away from your house.  • Remove dead trees. Embers from burning trees  can fly over a mile and can lead to a very fast  spread of a wildfire that will make evacuation and  firefighting even more difficult.    • Cut branches of trees that are close to the house.  This is a continuing process, actually best done in  the winter but don’t wait! Fire can easily leap fif- teen feet from a burning pine tree to your home.   • Re-check your “GO” bag to be sure it has what you  will need to evacuate the house. Review your plan  with your family. Update your list of what to grab  if you are notified by emergency officials of “Get  Ready to Evacuate” status. For more information  on the “Ready, Set, Go: Your Personal New Mexico  Wildfire Action Plan,” click here (https://www.san- diahomeowners.org/information/default/wildfire- anticipation).  Let’s work together as a community to reduce the risks to  each other, our homes, and the vistas we treasure.    Trash Pickup in May  Kathleen McCaughey, E&S Committee Chair    We will be doing a community trash pickup along Tram- way in May. All volunteers are welcome. Exact time and  date will be announced in the May issue of The GRIT.                        Community Events Bulletin Board  These groups are not sponsored by SHHA.  Information is provided to keep residents informed.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Cork &  Fork has resumed having bimonthly dinners. We  gather in the homes of our members. Each small din- ner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts.  The host decides the menu theme and prepares a  main dish, with attendees contributing to some part  of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller,  there are two whole-group dinners during the year.  All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To  inquire or join any time of year, call Rene Kessel at  (505) 504-3886 or email at  rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
