As in recent years, we will meet  in the lower-level fellowship hall of Church of the Good Shepherd, 7834  Tennyson St. NE.  Come a little early for refreshments and to meet and  visit with your Board of Directors and neighbors.    We will review SHHA’s 2023 activities, achievements, and challenges; hold  an election for new Directors; and host a time for Q & A. Only SHHA mem- bers are eligible to vote, but we invite every resident to attend, to listen  and learn, and to ask questions. We intend to steward the time well in or- der to both be thorough and conclude the meeting promptly.    Your presence and participation are crucial to the success of our associa- tion. Let's shape the future of Sandia Heights together!   We look forward to seeing you there.     GRIT Editor Needed    If you value this publication, please consider volunteering.

List, Resident    Only about thirty-five families lived in the entire sprawl- ing community of Sandia Heights when we moved here  in 1972.  In this small community we did our best to help  each other out.  We regularly carpooled to get our kids  into the city for activities such as pre-school, kindergar- ten, and summer day camp.  Since the ABQ Journal  didn’t deliver to “the boonies”, every Sunday various  guys in the neighborhood drove to the corner of Mont- gomery and Tramway Blvd to pick up a stack of papers  and hand deliver them to subscribers in Sandia Heights.     We watched the construction of new homes in the  neighborhood, thinking they were ‘encroaching’ upon  the open spaces we regarded as our very own, with vast  views of the mountains and city lights. Since we didn’t  know the folks who would eventually move in, we re- ferred to the new structures with names such as: the  small adobe round house, the ugly city-looking house,  the party house (ablaze with lights most every night),  the sloping roof house, the tall house, the ‘mole house’  (embedded so deeply into the soil that it was almost  hidden), the pink house, etc.  Eventually, though, we  got to know each other as we began to celebrate vari- ous holidays together. On Halloween parents shep- herded their children around the neighborhood. On  Christmas Eve small groups trudged from house to  house singing carols.  The best year was when a family  invited us inside on a very cold night to meet their  friends and enjoy warm beverages. Some people held  progressive dinner parties on New Year’s Eve.     Our children also got to know each other.  Some joined  the swim team that practiced in the neighborhood pool  (Yes, Sandia Heights used to have a community pool!)    and competed in and around Albuquerque. Many of our  children joined the Sandia Peak ski team that travelled  to other slopes in the Southwest for competitions.  The  most fun activity of all was our Sandia Heights Sloppy  Slalom back in the early 70’s. We held it on the weekend  after the ski area closed to the general public, so we had  the main slope under the chairlift all to ourselves. We  skiers wore light blue tee-shirts announcing our partici- pation, and non-skiers stood on the side cheering us on  and chuckling over our mishaps. After the event on the  slopes, there was a casual meal with music and dancing  in the restaurant at the base of the mountain. Prizes  were awarded in various categories, such as the fastest  and slowest skiers, and the funniest headgear and cos- tumes. I sadly won the category of the skier with the  most falls on the slope, although fortunately the ski pa- trol never had to be called that day.     Sometimes, Ben and Pat Abruzzo joined us in these  events, along with Sandia Ski Area partner Bob  Nordhaus and his wife Marge.     A mainstay in the community was Will Jackson – the one  person we called when we were in trouble. Will was one  of our volunteer firemen who had access to the “bomb- loader”, a weird-looking contraption he used to haul  our vehicles out of arroyos whenever we slid into them  off muddy or icy roads.                Most of us came together on a regular basis for Home- owners’ Association meetings at our neighborhood fire  station. I vividly remember one meeting when several  neighbors voiced concerns about minor issues.  Ben’s  response was something like, “I don’t know if you real- ize it, but I envision around 500 homes being built in  Sandia Heights over the years.” Silence in the room  gripped us all for several moments. But then, there  were remarks such as, “You can’t do this, Ben, you’ve  betrayed us.” I recall Ben shrugging his shoulders while  saying something like, “I’m sorry friends, but that’s al- ways been the plan. And I regret you haven’t known  about it until now.” Of course, in spite of this disheart- ening news, most of us continued to follow Ben’s bal- loon adventures on the world stage. This was partly be- cause we also knew his children, Louis, Benny, and Mary  Pat. The worst news of all was learning about Ben’s  deadly crash onto the median of I-25 in 1985 in the small  plane he was piloting. In addition to Ben, we lost his  wife Pat and four other gals from the neighborhood.  This ripped the heart out of our small Sandia Heights  community, and many of our traditions ceased.

The dates are subject to  change, but as of this writing, the Tram will close Janu- ary 9th and reopen on or around March 13, 2024.    Over the past 57 years, the Tram has carried more than  12 million riders up and down “our” mountain. The ex- tended closure will allow time for updates and upgrades  to their drive and control system. “The current system  has served us well since 1966 but it is time for a modern- ized, automated and more energy-efficient system. In  addition to the controls, we will be renovating the  Lower and Upper Terminal’s Tram Consoles, the drive  and control room and adding solar-powered cameras  and weather stations on Towers 1 & 2.”    According to the website https://sandiapeak.com/2024- maintenance-closure/ some of the anticipated benefits  will be:  •  Smoother Trip Experience  •  Greener and More Energy-Efficient Drive System  •  Enhanced Control Monitoring Systems  •  Improved Localized Weather Monitoring  •  Quicker Tram Trips During Busy Periods  •  Enhanced Guest Experience    Stay tuned to the website above for updates!  NOTE: As reported in October, Sandia Peak Ski has  brought on Mountain Capital Partners (MCP) to operate  the ski area. While they hope to open as soon as possi- ble, they first need to perform maintenance and hire  staff. Once Sandia Peak Ski opens, Ski Santa Fe pass hold- ers will not be able to use those passes here, but MCP  pass holders will.

Patricia is a native New Mexican who grew up in Albu- querque’s North Valley and has deep roots in northern  New Mexico.  As a child she loved doing art projects  and was encouraged by her grandmother in Taos who  painted and knew some of the original artists who had  founded the art colony there.  Patricia was not too in- terested in painting, but she developed a love for the  feel of clay, papier mâché, and woodcarving. “I wasn’t  any good at painting,” she said with a laugh, “but I re- ally enjoyed making things, 3-D things.  I found that I  loved wood: its luster, warmth, and grain.”     Patricia married, moved to West Albuquerque, and  raised a son. She and her family would drive regularly  to the east side where they enjoyed hiking and biking  in the Sandia foothills.  She worked first for the City of  Albuquerque and then the Albuquerque School District  as a mapping planner.  Although she was busy, she de- cided to take an “Introduction to Furniture Making”  adult education class at CNM.  There was only one  other woman in the class. She gained a basic  knowledge of the equipment and language of wood- working.  She also learned that the large equipment,  space needed, and materials for making furniture was  just not feasible for her to pursue.     Her office was near the convention center downtown.  If there was an event, she would often pop over to see  what was going on.  One fateful day, the American As- sociation of Woodturners was holding their annual  symposium.  Patricia, having never seen a demonstra- tion of woodturning, intently watched a small lady at a  lathe turning elegant wooden finials. The lady was re- nowned woodturner, Cindy Drozda, and she had put  Patricia under her spell. In time, Patricia and Cindy  would become friends.     Patricia went back to her office intrigued. This could be  feasible and fun, but she could not find any place  where she could learn woodturning.  She kept looking  and eventually found an article in the Albuquerque  Journal about a woodturning class offered by the Santa  Fe Community College’s woodworking program.  She  took the class, then took another. She started buying  tools. She had found a buried passion that started with  the woodcarving at her grandmother’s house. The San- dia foothill treks continued. The family began looking  for a house in Sandia Heights where they could head  out their front door into the wilderness, and with                 Continued on page 11…  8   The GRIT – January 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 1    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved -Projects activity since the last GRIT:    19 Cedar Hill Rd NE – Replace HVAC Units  212 Spring Creek Place -- Re-roof with Tan TPO  346 White Oaks Road -- Deck re-build  938 Bobcat Blvd -- Re-stucco/Paint Fireplace Ledge  1468 Morning Glory Road -- Patch Stucco/Restore  Wood  1531 Eagle Ridge Drive -- Cover Porches/Wine Cellar  1550 Eagle Ridge Lane -- Replace Windows  1830 Tramway Terrace Loop -- Re-roof with Tan Sili- cone  2121 Black Willow Drive --Re-stucco  2801 Tramway Circle -- Remove Fence/Install Wall  7713 Cedar Canyon Place --Paint Beams Front Entry  8215 Indigo Court --Replace Porch Pillar in Court- yard                  The figure illustrates  the interesting bed- rock of U-Mound: (A)  U-Mound  forms  a  prominent, erosion-re- sistant  landmark  along Trail 365; (B)  Black hematite and  pink feldspar form a  polka-dot pattern; (C)  Fresh  surfaces  ex- posed by cracking the  rock open reveal black  hematite inside; (D)  Black hematite leaves  a reddish streak.

Renowned Ground at U-Mound  Stan Davis, Resident    “U-Mound” is a prominent conical knob of rock in the  Sandia Foothills that has a series of “Natural Land- mark” signs leading you up to the top for the nice vis- tas (fig. A below). It is located just off the 365 Trail  near the Copper trailhead parking for the Foothills  OpenSpace.     U-Mound was named for a giant letter “U” con- structed of rocks painted white by UNM students in  the 1920’s on the city-facing side of the knob. A later  generation of students flipped them all over in the  1960’s, so the “U” is now gone. Aside from the histor- ical interest, U-Mound is a prime example of an inter- esting geologic phenomenon we find in some places  in the Sandias. This phenomenon turns the Sandia  Granite into a stunning red-and-black “polka-dot”- type of rock (fig. B below).

Their  search paid off. Twelve years ago, they were very  happy to find their current home. “I love it here. I feel  so blessed to live here.  We just walk/bike out our front  door and we are in the foothills. And there was an extra  bedroom that I could use for my woodturning studio.”   They put a lot of work into the house to make it their  home.  Some of that work included converting that ex- tra bedroom into Patricia’s woodturning shop which in- cluded a 600-pound lathe.  “I saw signs for the Sandia  Heights Artists Tour. We went to several sites. I  thought it was really cool, but at the time I was just  learning my craft and I never dreamed I would partici- pate.”    Patricia became a member of the New Mexico chapter  of the American Association of Woodturners (AAW).   There were only two other women in the chapter but  “the guys were very supportive of us.”  Patricia took  advantage of all that the local AAW chapter could of- fer, plus attending many workshops locally and nation- ally. She currently does demonstrations herself and  heads the local Women in Turning group, a sub-com- mittee within the local AAW chapter.     In 2016, although still working full time, Patricia had ad- vanced enough in her skills to “give the Sandia Heights  Artists Tour a try”, and she joined the group and partic- ipated in the tour. In 2018, Patricia retired and had the  time to devote to her avocation. “I progressed from  craft to making more artful pieces.” She  especially en- joyed making miniature pieces.  To accommodate the  tiny dimensions, she started making her own small- sized tools.  Her desire for excellence propels her. “I  want to express how a form should look. I strive for  perfection.  However, she said with a smile, “I have a  sign in my shop that reminds me: Perfection is the en- emy of good.”  She explained to me how woodworking  is a process of planning, creating, and bringing out the  luster with specific finishes. The turning lathe spins a  spell.  “I am inspired by the grain of the wood and have  an idea.  I start with a cube, round off the corners, and  it just kind of appears.  I get into a flow. It is very enjoy- able.” Patricia has done public demonstrations at the  New Mexico State Fair.   “Many women and girls watch  me and want to try it.”    Patricia has found that woodturning is as satisfying as  the furniture-making she considered years ago. She  does not need all the large, elaborate equipment and  shop to do it.  She does not need large amounts of  wood. She often uses small scrap pieces.  She gets to  revel in her love of the wood.  “The beauty is in there.   Nature already made something beautiful. I just reveal  it.”    Patricia will be participating in the next Sandia Heights  Artists Tour in fall of 2024.     Okjoo Lee    Some folks are not comfortable with experimentation  and unexpected outcomes, but Okjoo Lee thrives on it  as she explores her chosen art of pottery.         Okjoo has a rich cultural heritage that informs every as- pect of her life.  She was born in Seoul, South Korea  and grew up with four sisters.  Her mother wanted her  children to become professionals and, although Okjoo  was good at drawing and painting, it was decided that  Okjoo would become a nurse. Following her mother’s   Continued on page 12 …  12   The GRIT – January 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 1    Continued from page 11 …    direction, Okjoo dutifully went to nursing school, but  got side-tracked in an unusual way. A friend encour- aged her to enter a talent contest and by golly, Okjoo  won the competition to become a comedienne on  South Korean TV and radio!  She was successful and be- came a nationally-known celebrity. The work was ra- ther glamorous but grueling.  After 15 years in show biz,  she decided she really needed to get better at English.   She was set up on a blind date with her now husband,  Tom, an American who was in the international medical  business. Okjoo told me that she did not learn much  English on that date; but she told me with a smile, “I  learned something else.” This knowledge led to their  marriage in South Korea.     In 2000, they moved to Colorado, Tom’s home state;  but Tom quickly landed a job in Albuquerque.  His new  boss lived in Sandia Heights. They immediately looked  at a house here because they loved the amazing beauty  of the area.  It was love at first sight and no other house  could measure up. Now twenty-two years and many  renovations later, they are still very happy in the home  where they raised two sons and a daughter.        Raising the children kept Okjoo very busy.  She had lit- tle time to pursue any artistic activity. But soon after  her first son turned 18, she took a pottery class at the  Not Made in China pottery studio in Albuquerque.  Her  choice of pottery was very much influenced by the  ubiquitous role of ceramics in South Korean life. Ko- rean pottery began with the oldest earthenware from  around 8000 BCE. It is an integral part of the culture  and has evolved into a highly developed art form which  is world famous.  “You grow up with it,” she explained.  There are entire specialized buildings called anagama,  which are multi-chambered firing kilns. Pottery is  taught in the public schools and that is where Okjoo  learned the basics of making pottery.      Once her children became independent, she turned  more to her love of getting her hands in clay.  She put  an electric kiln in the garage and converted a room  downstairs into her studio. “It was so relaxing and en- joyable.  It made me very happy. When I focused on the  process I did not think or worry about anything else.”  Even though she was still busy with family, she prac- ticed in earnest and began showing her work at Mari- posa and Weem’s galleries in Albuquerque.  A few  years later, she heard about the Sandia Heights Artists  Tour, but she felt too busy. With the encouragement  from other Sandia Heights Artists members, she partic- ipated in her first tour this year. “I finally did it! They  were such an open and supportive group. They did not  stop when their kids were raised. Stop did not mean  stop—it meant start something new. They motivated  and inspired me. It was a very positive experience.”  Okjoo loves to explore every aspect of her art form.   She hand-builds some items and utilizes her wheel with  others. She uses several clays, many firing methods, as  well as a myriad of glazes and techniques. As Okjoo  showed me examples of her pottery, she explained en- thusiastically, “I love to experiment—to try this color,  this pattern, this combination. I want to do as many  types as I can. I do not want to do the same thing over  and over. I cannot replicate the same thing.  It is unpre- dictable. The kiln technique is the hardest part.  You  can never be finished with learning. The temperature,  length of time in the kiln, and even humidity, combine  in unexpected ways. I am always scared when I open  the kiln. We say, ‘The kiln god decides.’”    Okjoo told me that she wants to create a merging of  her two cultures.  “I have lived in New Mexico for   22 years, but I have my Korean culture inside.  I am striv- ing for a balance between the Korean influence and the  American Southwest influence. I want to blend this to  create something new.  I hope that people can see that  in my work.”    Continued on page 15 …    13  The GRIT – January 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 1 14   The GRIT – January 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 1    Continued from page 2…    Things were never the same; we no longer celebrated  Halloween, Christmas, and New Year’s together as an  entire community. Instead, smaller clusters of neigh- bors formed with individuals designated as ‘block cap- tains’ charged with hosting occasional informal get-to- gethers and distributing lists of neighbors with ad- dresses, phone numbers, and makes of vehicles owned  by all. This enabled us to be on the alert for any unusual  activity occurring at a neighbor’s home. We now have  much more Sandia Heights security coverage than in  earlier years.    Many advances have been made in the last 50-plus  years in our community, but the serenity of the San- dias, the city lights at night, and the ever-changing  skies and cloud formations continue. I truly feel  blessed to be part of this community that Ben Abruzzo  and Bob Nordhaus envisioned decades ago, and that  Will Jackson was instrumental in helping bring to frui- tion.

She  explained to me that coming to the USA as an adult  was hard. The language barrier was tough and isolat- ing.  She could not communicate like she wanted. “I  was well known at home, a celebrity. Here no one  knew me. My self-esteem was low.”  But when she  began to show her ceramics, she was able to present  her talent through her art. Folks who bought her work  sent her photographs of her pieces in their homes,  along with notes about how much they loved them.   This made Okjoo very happy.  Art, as it is meant to do,  had transcended the language barrier.      You can see and purchase Okjoo’s art at Mariposa Gal- lery and Weem’s Gallery in Albuquerque. She will also  be participating in the Sandia Heights Artists Tour in  Fall 2024.                Renowned Ground   Continued from page 8 …    According to academics, some time after the injection  of white-appearing dikes into the Sandia Granite (see  GRIT, June 2023), a more recent episode of hydrother- mal activity injected hot iron-rich fluids into the granite  along faults and small fractures and cracks. While  white/milky quartz and pink feldspar remained mostly  unaltered, white feldspar and brown biotite were  chemically altered to black hematite (iron oxide, Fe2O3)  and some green non-gem-quality epidote (a silicate).  Hematite is often red, but in this case, it is black. The  resulting rock is generally harder than the original gran- ite, helping U-Mound to remain a local erosion-re- sistant knob within the slightly more erosion-prone un- altered granite surrounding it.     The black hematite does not just form a weathering- type coating on exposed surfaces; being quite brittle,  it allows rock samples to be easily cracked open with                            a hammer, revealing that hematite is present through- out the rock matrix (along with the pink feldspar, fig.  C). When the hematite is scraped across an unglazed  porcelain tile, it leaves a reddish streak, typical of all  hematite, regardless of color (fig. D).  Unlike magnetite (another iron oxide, Fe3O4), which is  strongly magnetic (GRIT, Jan 2023), hematite is only  very weakly magnetic; conventional magnets won’t  stick to it, but a very strong magnet will (fig. E). Other  examples of knobs of resistant granite with black hem- atite exist in the foothills. A knob that is only slightly  smaller than U-Mound is located at the southern ex- tremity of Trail 365, on the way to the “Metal Yucca”  along I-40.  An easily accessed miniature version of U- Dome called “Supper Rock” stands prominently in the  otherwise flat Supper Rock Park in the Supper Rock  neighborhood.     U-Mound was once famous for its giant white “U”, but  it and these other prominent knobs are now famous  (or at least distinctive) for their black-and-red rocks!
