Non-board  members are limited to three minutes, but your input is valuable to our  doing the good work for Sandia Heights. You will only be asked to excuse  yourself from the room if we go into executive session.  I continue to sit in on as many committee meetings as I can in order to  stay in touch with the workings of your board and am never less than im- pressed by the level of dedication shown by our neighbors. I started my  career with the SHHA two years ago, sitting on the Finance Committee,  then the Architectural Committee and then the Covenant Support Com- mittee serving as the liaison between those latter two committees. There  are plenty of opportunities for you to serve, board membership is not re- quired to be on a committee, and you can make a difference with just a  wee bit of your time...shoot me an email if you are interested.  A major shout out to those fourteen of your neighbors who reported  for duty on May 11th to assist with the clean-up of our portion of Tramway  Boulevard. (See photo on next page.) The team was led by Kathleen  McCaughey, who rewarded us with a post pick-up cup of coffee...thanks  Kathleen! Fortunately, a massive amount of trash is not typically collected,  partly thanks to the ongoing efforts of fellow resident Bob Bower...you  have all seen him out there keeping the roadway clean, but our volun- teers’ efforts definitely made a difference. I was a bit taken aback by the  number of liquor bottles I picked up in the median, but with all of the  drunks I’ve stopped in my previous career, I guess I shouldn’t be!   The monthly ‘rant’.  I debated between unleashed dogs and RVs, but I  am going with RVs for this month. We all know that storing an RV on your  lot is a ‘non-starter,’ you just cannot do it. A couple of days while you are  in transition, cleaning and restocking, is okay...but please, make other ar- rangements for storage of that piece of gear other than on your lot.   Remember our office staff, including our newest member Hope Fryer,  is available five days a week; please reach out to them via email or a phone  call with your issues or concerns. Of course, you can also reach out to me  at president@sandiahomeowners.org. I promise you will receive a re- sponse.  2   The GRIT – July 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 7  …continued on page 3  The Clean Team        Volunteers picked up trash on May 11 along our  adopted stretch of Tramway. In addition to those in the  photo, were Carla Busick, Tonya Bailie, Paul  Baumgartner, Charles Ewing, Keith Julian, and Claudia  Mitchell. Thank you, volunteers! If you missed out, your  chance will come again in the fall.    What’s in A Name?  Ann List, Resident    At a recent SHHA committee meeting, someone  wondered, “Where did the name come from?” My  response was something like, “Back in the early 1970s  when we had only about 40 families here, The GRIT  stood for ‘the nitty-gritty’ of neighborhood news and  events.” Do any other long-timers have a better  memory than mine? If so, please share.    The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell, C&P Committee Chair    Many, if not most, artists have a muse that inspires their  artistic path. But Jonna James has three: Hugh, Murray,  and Porter, all elderly rescue pups who lounge in  Jonna’s studio while she paints. “I run a nursing home  for dogs,” Jonna joked when I was greeted by the  canine trio, but once inside, it looked like an artist’s  studio—stacked with art ready for her next show, a  spacious drafting table with paints and brushes, a large  work in progress, art on all the walls—and, yes, dog  beds and bowls.  Jonna grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by a family  of artists. Her mother started doing art around age 4,  raised a family and started oil painting at age 65. Her  uncles were sculptors. She had an aunt who was a  showgirl in New York, but that is another story. Jonna’s  immediate family were busy in retail business and Jonna  loved doing the window displays, creatively arranging  clothing and accessories. Jonna pursued her art  education at the California College of The Arts. Besides  her interest in visual arts, she loved dance and music  and participated in musical theater. She completed her  degree in art and theatre at a private college in Artesia,  New Mexico. It was there that she became enchanted  by the Land of Enchantment.  Jonna got married  and moved to Okla- homa. She went back  to school at Oklahoma  State University, Okla- homa City Campus, and  earned a degree in  landscape architect- ture. Graphic design,  architectural render- ing, color coordina- tion, and precise planning were essential parts of this  course of study and informs her artwork today. She had  a career teaching architecture and horticulture at  Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City. In her  spare time, she illustrated the children’s books that she  wrote with whimsical watercolors.  Life has twists and turns and the New Mexico en- chantment renewed its call. Jonna began a new chapter  moving to Taos in 2012. She and a few friends owned  and operated an art gallery on the Plaza. Jonna began  to work in acrylics and continued to develop her style.  She enjoyed her time in Taos but after four years made  the decision to move to Albuquerque.   After living in Taos, she wanted something with  some character and a view. Her real estate agent found  the perfect house in Sandia Heights which has been  Jonna’s home and studio since 2017. In 2018, she  decided to get involved in the Sandia Heights Artists  and join the annual tour.      Randy  Tripp  Jim  Stewart  Kathleen  McCaughey  Eric  Faulring  Steve Baca  Cheryl  Wieker  Elizabeth  Edgren  Larry Dragan  … continued from page 2  3   The GRIT – July 2024 – Volume 40 – No. 7    In Albuquerque, Jonna was invited to join a gallery in  Old Town. Since she had gallery experience, the owner  asked her to help out occasionally. One day when Jonna  was working, a customer stopped at a rack of notecards  featuring Jonna’s art. She asked Jonna if she knew the  artist. The customer was a buyer for a company that  supplied airport gift shops throughout the country and  soon Jonna’s art was in those shops. Sadly, the pan- demic shut down travel and the business relationship.  However, when the pandemic restraints eased, other  buyers saw her art online. Soon Jonna was busy again  supplying buyers with her creations. In fact, she was so  busy meeting the demands of those buyers, that she  had no time to create. Through some friends and seren- dipity, she found an agent to field those demands. Now  Jonna’s art can be found in diverse forms from jigsaw  puzzles to men’s ties, needlepoint to shoes, and fabric  to phone cases—to name a few.  Once she had time to get back to the drawing board,  so to speak, she could create her original fine art. Alt- hough the Old Town gallery closed, she shows her art in  various restaurants throughout Albuquerque and Santa  Fe, ScoJo’s Gift Shop in Albuquerque, as well as being in  a gallery in Madrid, New Mexico. She has been in juried  shows in Albuquerque and in the western United  States. Her art has been purchased by the City of Albu- querque Arts Board and the State of New Mexico.  Jonna is pleased but surprised by the commercial suc- cess that she has had. When asked about how her  graphic, very colorful signature style developed she  said, “I just came up with it through intuitive painting. I  gravitated to bright color after doing so much architec- tural work in black and white. I am expressing happiness  and joy.” When I asked her why she painted, she imme- diately replied, “I need to paint. I have to paint. I just  want to express myself artistically.”  Jonna’s art can be viewed and purchased at her web- site www.jonnajamesartist.com. She will be exhibiting  at the Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour, Sept 7–8,  2024, www.sandiaheightsartists.com.    Sandia Heights Artists   Support Young Creatives  Claudia Mitchell    A special feature of the Sandia Heights Artists Studio  Tour is their financial contribution to the La Mesa Arts  Academy (LMAA) art program in the Albuquerque Inter- national District. This program was founded in 2006  through the cooperative effort of La Mesa Presbyterian  Church and La Mesa Elementary School to establish an  after-school creative arts program for La Mesa Elemen- tary School students. The art, music, dance, and re- cently, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts,  and mathematics) classes provide opportunities to par- ticipate in culturally relevant activities, creative self-ex- pression, and socio-emotional learning. The classes are  free for La Mesa Elementary School students. Funds for  salaries and materials are provided through a combina- tion of community-based fundraisers, Sandia Heights  Artists, and grants from organizations such as New  Mexico Arts and APS Title One Funds.  The Sandia Heights Artists participate in LMAA fund- raising events during other times in the year. On April  28, the LMAA held their annual Blues and BBQ end-of- school fundraiser. Several Sandia Heights Artists took  part in the Academy’s efforts to fund next fall’s semes- ter. Charlotte Driver, the chair of the Sandia Heights Art- ists Charity Committee, is a LMAA Steering Committee  member as well as a pottery teacher at LMAA during the  school year. She maintains the flow of information be- tween LMAA and the Sandia Heights Artists. For further  information, you may contact Charlotte Driver at  charlottes.pots@gmail.com. The Sandia Heights Artists  Tour is September 7–8, 2024.    Sandia Heights Artists participating in LMAA fundraising    Wanna Be Published in The GRIT?

Part 1  Stan Davis  Would you be surprised to learn that ruins of a small  pueblo (“pueblito”) reside within a “stone’s throw” of  our neighborhood? Due east of the northernmost sec- tion of North Sandia Heights (NSH), within National  Forest land, but west of the Tramway (aka Foothills)  Trail, lie the eroded remains of the Jaral Pueblito. As  the name indicates, the setting for this site is the rela- tively small Jaral (pronounced “Ha-RAL”) Canyon. The  location of this pueblito is actually not very surprising,  given its proximity to fairly reliable spring water and  numerous ephemeral streams. The Jaral Canyon area  was studied by the Albuquerque Archaeology Society  and USDA Forest Service personnel starting in 1978 (P.  Davis, 1984), when up to 37 historic and prehistoric  sites were identified. Professional archaeologist and  pottery expert Hayward Franklin conducted laboratory  analysis of 138 pottery sherds (“SHURDS”) collected by  the National Forest since then (H. Franklin, 2010, and  pers. comm.). Franklin also conducted relatively recent  field mapping work with colleagues from the UNM  Maxwell Museum of Anthropology and with Forest  personnel (H. Franklin, 2021). Figure 1 is a picture taken  during one of the field excursions.     Figure 1: Picture taken from a field mapping excursion to Jaral Pueblito,  showing red flags marking foundation stones and other artifacts on the  mound that is what remains of the site (picture from H. Franklin, 2021).    Hayward and I recently hiked in to visit the Jaral  Pueblito ruins. Today the remains are hard to see, but  Hayward’s trained eyes helped me detect them. The  main indication of the presence of Jaral today is the  alignment of foundation stones embedded in and stick- ing not very far above the ground, forming linear pat- terns and subtle right angles. Figure 2 shows some ex- amples of these stones. All surface sherds and lithics  (stone tools) have long since been picked over, ille- gally. Jaral was among the largest of the numerous  pueblitos built along the Foothills, consisting of 15–20  contiguous rooms, probably one story (perhaps two?)  tall, arranged in a rough “C” pattern, next to the main  drainage. Unfinished granite field stones were used as  foundations, while upper walls were probably stone  chinked with adobe, with wood roofs. Lack of exten- sive midden accumulation indicates the pueblito had  limited occupation and may have been used mainly  seasonally.     Figure 2: Examples of aligned foundation stones at Jaral Pueblito (pictures  by author).  Extensive laboratory analysis of rim and body sherds  from 42 bowls and 96 jars was important for determin- ing the age of Jaral. Key identifiers of potsherds in- clude, foremost, design style, particularly rim shapes;  but, also, color and reaction to firing (oxidation). Alt- hough no absolute ages were determined for the Jaral  sherd samples, they end up falling within the well-es- tablished Rio Grande Glazeware Sequence chronology,  which is underpinned by quantitative methods. All the  pottery at Jaral was manufactured mainly during and a  little since the Middle Rio Grande Pueblo IV (PIV) or Clas- sic time periods, depending on which classification sys- tem is used. This period lasted from about 1350–1600  CE. Major changes were happening in pueblo culture  during this time, including the transition to building  large adobe pueblos of several hundred rooms in the  Rio Grande Valley, and an evolution in ceramic technol- ogy, with the introduction of multiple colors and more  lead-based glazing. Outside date estimates for Jaral ce- ramics are about 1500–1700 CE, with concentration in  the 1550–1650 CE range, hence leading up into historic  periods, making Jaral also one of the longest occupied  pueblitos along the Foothills. Examples of the Jaral  pottery sherds are on page 8 in this edition of The GRIT.

We gather  in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group  is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. The host de- cides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with at- tendees contributing to some part of the meal—along  with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on  food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most  of the dinners are smaller, there are two whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights resi- dents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at   rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.

Film crews  had blocked off the streets near several of our sched- uled house tours, necessitating GPS-unfriendly detours  and some worries about whether we’d be able to see  our chosen homes at all.  Even though New Mexico had  begun to advertise itself as a filming destination, I had  just assumed these advertisements were a combina- tion of wishful thinking and puffery.  Instead, I found  the phenomenon was real in ways I hadn’t counted on.    Lately I became curious as to how many films had  scenes shot in or near Sandia Heights.  The online IMDb  database had the answer.  The database is searchable  by movie location, which is the technique I used to  come up with the following list.   I had to use “Sandia  Mountains” as a proxy for “Sandia Heights,” but below  are the results, listed in chronological order.  All are  movies I haven’t seen — but might, this summer!

They are busy keeping up with our approximately  2200 residents and fielding questions or concerns. Let’s  meet the crew.     Diane Barney leads the team as Office Director. Starting  in November 2022 she began working with the office  staff to assist in upgrades and time-consuming projects.  She currently continues those duties plus training staff  and providing backup in emergencies. Diane has lived in  Sandia Heights for 28 years and has been contributing  to the SHHA office and committees over the past 25  years.  When she is not involved in supporting the SHHA  office, she enjoys being in the Sandia open spaces on  her mountain bike or climbing. She also “tickles some  piano keys” and monitors wild raptor projects (see  Dec.2022 & April 2023 GRIT issues).       Trish Lovato started in April 2023 as Lead Administrator  after thirteen years as the foster parents’ secretary for  the Bair Foundation Treatment Foster Care Services.  She is responsible for accounting duties including ad- ministering the checking account and Sandia Tram  passes.
