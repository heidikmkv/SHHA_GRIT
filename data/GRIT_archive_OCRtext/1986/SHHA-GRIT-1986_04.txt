It haa also contracted to lay residential pipelines into Unit 15 of Sandia Heights South (per an arrangenent that ae negotiates on behalf of all participating lot owners in Unit 13), costing each lot owner #1500, for Laying the gt’ property line. In’ add  pipeline to’ the lot will fo pay forthe installation of the nem noskup charge Gle., from the street into the house). Although actual charges for the  yard lines ay vary, cepending on the encountered soil conditions (#9. Row much rock has to be removed or cut through) and whether Langscaping requires replacement afterwards, the following are approximate rates that can be used for estimating yerd line cost:  For a standard size yard line (3/4 Inch diameter), $5.75 per foot.  If rocky 2911 conditians are encountered, add #1.80 per foot.  If relandscaping is required, add $1.15 per foot.  How much it might cast for Romeowers/1ot omers in the various remaining areas of Sandia Heights to cotain natural ges service will. be largely Gependent on hom many home and” lot ouners” are interested in signing up for gas service, and also on how the participating homes/lots happen to be distributed geosraphically.  The Gas Company is unable to give firm cost estimates without knowing how many and which lots are interested in being thus served. For example, if as many ag GO% of all lots in Sandia Heights Sauth were to commit to signing up for aervice ot the cutest, with « reasonably Uniform cistribution resulting throughout, 1£ might ‘be possible for the gas mains to be installed past all Sandia Heights South lots without any initial charges being required. Naturally, smaller proportionati pation and/or less uniform distribution would be expected to ne Righer initial charges.  Se that eaningfill discussions can be initiated with the Gas Company regarding obtaining gas service for various parts and/or all of Sancia Weights South, with firm charges being figured, we need a realist: Indication ag to which homeounera/iot owners may be interested in signing Up for natural gas wervice, Because of the uniqueness of #ach homes existing construction and heating system, if ts not feasible to attempt fo provide meaningful information regarding hon much is sight cost to have your home's Resting systes converted 5 natural gi Not ts it possible to predict Now mich savings on energy costs might be realized by any individual hone.
