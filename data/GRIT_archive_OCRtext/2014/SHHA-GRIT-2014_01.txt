His enduring  themes, articulate and amusing stories, and  populist ideals make him one of those rare  young artists who is carrying the torch of  Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott. He  rolls in off the road, pulls out a guitar, and  proceeds to take us back to the basics: family,  love, gratitude, laughter. It's the timeless art of  the true troubadour, keeping alive the American  folk tradition.    A prolific songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and  true entertainer, Klyma brings to every show a  deep catalog of material that assumes audiences  are both smart and able to laugh. Laughing is  guaranteed!  Check  out  his  music  at  www.klyma.com.    This will be an all-ages, alcohol-free event,  presented by the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (www.sandiahomeowners.org).

These  two properties are the Mhoon Property  (Hawkes Landing – CSU-2013-0039) and  the vacant property next to Futures for  Children (CSU-2013-0036).      Both of these SUP requests have been  initially heard by the County Planning  Commissioners and deferred until 2014 to  allow time for residents & developers to  exchange information and opinions.  The  Mhoon property was deferred until Wed,  March 5, 2014 and the Futures for Children  property was deferred until Wed. Feb 5,  2014.  These two properties are not a part of  SHHA but adjacent to SHHA  neighborhoods.  We expect resident &  developer communication meetings will be  scheduled in Jan & Feb 2014. As we know  more about meetings, we will put this  information on the website and in the  GRIT.       Roadrunner Holiday Food Drive  The food drive was a huge success.

Install  secondary thumbscrew locks on guide rails.  Place them in a location that  prohibits the window from being opened more than a few inches.  Also, make  sure screens are in place and secure.  (Note:  Windows and pet doors are  common illegal entry points)          If it snows while you’re out of town, get a neighbor to drive into your driveway (SHS will do this,  time and terrain permitting) and walk up to your door. Drifts of snow are a dead giveaway no one is  home. Burglars don’t take days off due to bad weather.    2014 Resident Directory and Guide  On the right is the winning photo by Kendrick  Frazier that is featured on the cover of the  directory.

This is done to  preserve the enjoyment of the night sky  from light pollution. Regardless of the  individual covenants for your Unit, the  entire North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia  Heights fall under the Bernalillo County  Code for light pollution. The code includes,  but is not restricted to security lighting,  street lights, landscape lights, building  mounted area lights, building façade lights.  In general, lights shall remain OFF between  11:00 pm and sunrise; lights on buildings  shall be mounted no higher than 16 feet;  lights must be shielded so the light is  directed perpendicular to the ground.    To see the entire code and for exceptions, go  to the Bernalillo County Website  (www.bernco.gov) and look under  ordinances, Section 30-186. So, if you leave  your lights on at the entry, garage doors,  house floods, after 11:00pm and they are not  shielded they may be in violation of the  County Code. While the CSC does not  enforce County ordinances we will work  with folks to make them aware of the  options and try to get resolution. At night,  even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to  enjoy the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city  below.                   Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that  improper storage of trash cans is a violation  of all our Sandia Heights Covenants which  state in general:  “Garbage shall be placed in  covered containers, said containers to be  concealed from public view…”  Please,  when your trash and recyclables have been  collected, return your bins to storage out of  public view.  Thanks for helping keep  Sandia Heights a beautiful place for all of us  to live.      Communications & Publications  Committee ~ By George Connor,  Acting Chair, C&P    Security Email Alert System:   The office has a security email alert system  that is available to all SHHA members  whose email addresses are in our database.  If you would like to receive email alerts  please call the office at 797-7793 or email us  at sandiaheights@comcast.net. Also, if you  have changed your email address please  notify us so that we can update the database.     Online GRIT newsletter viewing is  free on the SHHA website  www.sandiahomeowners.org. The printed  mailed GRIT costs SHHA members over  $15,000 per year and lots of trees! You can  sign up to receive email alerts and you will  receive a notification, including the link,  when the online version of the GRIT is  available for viewing. The aim is to have  members consider receiving the GRIT  electronically instead of the printed version.  The advantages, besides saving trees and  reducing mailing and printing costs, are  quite attractive: the electronic version is in  color and has useful internet links to passive  and dynamic internet pages. For example,  we can, in the future, include video and  PowerPoint presentations of events of  interest to SH residents. Also, the on-line  version is higher resolution. If you do decide  to sign up for the online GRIT you will also  receive email alerts regarding any activity in  the Sandia Heights area that might affect  you, such as a wildlife alert or a security  issue. To sign up, either call the office at  797-7793 or email us at  sandiaheights@comcast.net.      8   The GRIT – January 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 1                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   27 Cedar Hill Place – After the fact  Landscaping  27 Juniper Hill Road – Photovoltaic Panels  147 Whitetail Road – Playground Equipment   234 Spring Creek Court – Photovoltaic Panels  350 White Oaks Drive – After the fact  Landscaping  418 Live Oak Court – Roof Repairs  515 Black Bear Road – Exterior Additions  633 Cougar Loop – Patio Fence  731 Tramway Lane – Stucco Repairs  940 Bobcat Blvd. – Re-stucco, Refinish Trim,  Garage Door & Window Replacements  955 Antelope Avenue – Landscaping  965 Antelope Avenue - After the fact  Landscaping  980 Antelope Ave – Reroof  1041 Red Oaks Loop - Photovoltaic Panels  1059 Red Oaks Loop - Reroof  1129 Marigold Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  1143 Marigold Drive – Replace Windows  1174 Laurel Loop – Repaint Stucco  1235 Rockrose Road – Refinish Trim  1476 Morning Glory Road – Driveway  Replacement  1941 Quail Run Drive – Windows and Doors  2126 Globe Willow Ave. – Roof Repair  2412 Tramway Terrace Court – Partial Reroof  2510 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence and  HVAC Replacement   2728 Tramway Circle – Reroof  2740 Tramway Circle – Photovoltaic Panels  7711 Cedar Canyon Place – Photovoltaic  Panels  11108 Bobcat Place – After the Fact  Landscaping and Door Replacement   Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.         Summary of ACC Articles  Published in 2013 by Bob Bower,  Chairman, ACC    Following my custom for the January GRIT,  articles published in 2013 are shown below for  your reference.
