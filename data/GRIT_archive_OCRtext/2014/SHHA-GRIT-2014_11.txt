The  Holidays can be difficult for many New  Mexicans. Food drives enable  food banks to  provide a wide variety of high quality, nutritious  food items throughout the year. The Roadrunner  Food Bank of New Mexico distributes more than  22 million pounds of food a year to hundreds of  nonprofit agencies throughout New Mexico.  Each one of us can make an impact.     We have been collecting food since September  for the Roadrunner Food Bank. Please help by  bringing non-perishable food items to the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association office located  at San Rafael and Tramway. Office hours are  Monday through Friday 9am - 4pm. Look for the  big red drop bins inside. The deadline is Friday,  Dec. 12.     Most Needed Items:  Macaroni & Cheese, Canned Fruits, Canned  Vegetables, Canned Meats, Canned Entrees,  Cereal Bars, Rice, Sugar, Pastas, Soups, Baby  Food, Boxed Meals. Plastic, boxed, bagged and  canned containers present less chance of  breakage and less loss of good food.

All  that is needed is for the property owner to maintain membership  in SHHA. Many property owners mistakenly believe that if they  move from Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be collected as part of the  monthly utility bill for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If you as a property  owner pay the bill, you are free to pass along the cost of  membership to the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for  all SHHA membership benefits except voting privileges and  filing covenant violation complaints. Tram passes are among  the most popular member benefits, so be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience some of the great  “perks” of living in Sandia Heights!      Tram Passes:  SHHA has purchased 8  corporate tram passes per day.

By Bob Bower,  Chairman, ACC    Once again, it’s time for my annual article on  ways to avoid frozen pipes when the weather  turns cold.  It’s too early yet to tell if  Albuquerque’s upcoming winter of  2014- 2015 will be unusually cold or not but I think  it’s always a good time right now to remind  you how to protect your water pipes from the  effects of very cold weather.  Most of the  “local experts” on this subject generally agree  that steps need to be taken to protect water  pipes if temperatures are expected to drop  below 21 degrees Fahrenheit.  A broken water  pipe inside your home can cause a lot of  extensive and expensive damage!    Let’s start with the outside of your home.   Disconnecting water hoses and protecting    outdoor water faucets are very important.   Water that freezes in outdoor hoses connected  to faucets causes a buildup of pressure on  interior plumbing that can result in a rupture  of the interior pipes if the pressure is too high.   Damage to these interior pipes near an outdoor  water faucet is often difficult to repair due to  the inaccessibility of these pipes.   Disconnecting hoses from these outdoor  faucets and protecting the faucets with hard  foam insulating cups are good ways to reduce  the chances of damage to these water pipes  that protrude through your exterior walls.   These inexpensive foam cups can be  purchased at most home improvement or  hardware stores and are easy to install.  I’ve  also found that it is wise to wrap all outdoor  faucets with some insulation prior to placing  the foam cup over the faucet, particularly if  the faucet is located on the north side of your  home or is located in an area that does not  receive any winter sunshine.  Also, if you have  any water pipes that are located outside your  home that are exposed to the outside  temperatures, you should consider using  insulating tape or heat tape around these  exposed pipes.    Now, let’s consider the inside of your home.   If Albuquerque experiences a spell of  extremely cold weather where temperatures,  particularly at night, drop to below the 21  degrees Fahrenheit “benchmark”, leave the  water supply line on at a very slow drip rate  somewhere inside your home.  Water in “slow  motion” is much less likely to freeze than  water that is motionless inside of a pipe.   Normally, a faucet located far away from  where the water enters your home is the one  that you should use for this purpose.  The cost  of water used is insignificant compared to the  cost of repairing damage caused by a broken  water line inside your home.  Normally, these  very cold spells don’t last too long so leaving  an indoor faucet dripping for a few days and  nights should get you through these spells  until warmer temperatures return.  If you are  away from your home during the cold season,  make sure that there is adequate heat inside  your home to prevent pipes from freezing.   Even when trying to save energy costs, don’t  turn the heat too far down and don’t turn the  heat off altogether unless you have all of the  water lines properly drained.  Believe me, I  have seen the damage caused by pipes that  have not been properly drained and have  subsequently burst inside the home where the  heat has been turned off!      One final note for those of you who have  swamp coolers.  If you have not already done  so, be sure to drain the water reservoir and  disconnect and drain the water supply line. It  doesn’t take much of a freeze to damage these  cooler components.  Have a great winter!!        CLASSIFIED AD:  WANTED: Reliable person for occasional  pet duties and occasional house/pet sitting.  Must like to walk!

A burglar won’t  spend the time to try to break into a safe; though he will take it with him  and worry about opening it later if it is not secured.   If you don’t have an alarm system in your home, leave your car keys  next to your bed within easy reach. If you hear someone trying to break in, hit the panic  button on your car keys. Most have the range to reach your vehicle and the alarm will go off,  and continue to do so until you turn it off or your battery dies.   Be aware of someone knocking on your door or ringing your doorbell during the day.   Chances are it could be a burglar checking to see if you are home or not. Always  acknowledge the knock or ring. You can yell through the door letting them know you are  home. NEVER ignore it! If they think no one is at home, they will break in and now you  could be confronting burglars with you still at home.   Please lock your car if it sits outside. Believe it or not, most auto burglaries are done by the  thief simply opening the car door. That’s why they troll the neighborhoods trying door  handles looking for the ones left unlocked. Don’t leave the garage remote in the car either. If  they get it, they can get inside your home through the garage door.    Remember this little saying; “If you want to find something of value in your car in the  morning, don’t leave it in the car overnight!”   SHARON: JUDSON  Doing What's Right for You Selling Sandia Heights Homes!

This is done to   preserve the enjoyment of the night sky  without the effects of unnecessary light  pollution.  North Albuquerque Acres and  Sandia Heights fall under the Bernalillo  County Code for light pollution. The code  includes, but is not restricted to, security  lighting, street lights, landscape lights,  building-mounted area lights, and building  façade lights.     In general, lights shall remain OFF between  11:00 pm and sunrise; lights on buildings shall  be mounted no higher than 16 feet; lights must  be shielded so the light is directed  perpendicular to the ground.  To see the entire  code and for exceptions, go to the Bernalillo  County Website (www.bernco.gov) and look  under ordinances, Section 30-186. If you leave  your lights on at the entry doors, garage doors,  or house floods after 11:00 pm, they may be in  violation of the County Code.  Whether or not  the lights are shielded, they cannot be on past  11:00pm. While the CSC does not enforce  County ordinances, we will work with folks to  make them aware of the options and try to  resolve a light pollution complaint.  At night,  even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to enjoy  the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city below.                    Complaints from The Hatfields and McCoys    Albuquerque is about 1200 miles from Eastern  Kentucky and many years have passed since  the infamous Hatfield/McCoy feud.  However,  in the CSC we are seeing what appears to be  retaliatory covenant complaints filed mainly  because “you complained about me so I will  complain about you”.  The CSC will  investigate all of the complaints we receive  but we really do not want to get involved in  feuding between neighbors.  Before you file a  complaint, please ask yourself if you are  motivated primarily by retaliation or if this is  something that needs to be corrected (if you  put up with it for the past 10 years it may be  the former).  We also get complaints and  office phone calls about disputes among  neighbors that are subsequently determined  not to be valid covenant violations.  We  cannot help you in these matters – we only  investigate suspected violations that are  written and cite specific sections in the  covenants that are being violated.      Changes to Unit Covenants    Your Unit Covenants are legal documents that  were originally written between the Grantor  and the homeowner.  SHHA was not a party to  the development of the covenants and cannot  change or modify them; we were only given  assignee rights to enforce covenants.   However, each Unit has the right to modify  their own covenants by a vote (usually 75%)  of the homeowners. These changes must then  be filed with the County. While the covenants  do not require notification to SHHA of  changes, we do try to keep the latest covenants  on the Web site as well as in hard copy.      Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – November 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 11                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    IF YOUR UNIT VOTES TO MAKE CHANGES  TO THE UNIT COVENANTS PLEASE GIVE A  COPY OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE  SHHA OFFICE.  Up to date records of covenants  are especially important to homeowners selling  their houses (covenants need to be supplied to  buyers) as well as supplying them to renters.       ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   12 Juniper Hill Road – Repaint Trim and Gates  28 Cedar Hill Place – Add Windows  40 Cedar Hill Place – Roof Repair  218 Spring Creek Lane – Repair and Restucco  Courtyard Wall  508 Black Bear Road – Window Replacement  511 Roadrunner Lane – Window Replacement  636 Cougar Loop – Resurface Asphalt Driveway  672 Blackhawk Drive – Restucco and Refinish  Trim  880 Tramway Lane Court – Restucco, Roof Repair  and Paint Trim  1009 Tramway Lane – Window and Door  Replacement  1022 Tramway Lane – Restucco and Refinish Trim  1129 Marigold Drive – Restucco and Refinish Trim  1229 Rockrose Road – Restucco and Landscaping  1483 Morning Glory Road – Enclosure   1501 Eagle Ridge Road – Reroof  1508 Eagle Ridge Road - Restucco  1542 Eagle Ridge Place – Patio/Roof Replacement  1821 Tramway Terrace Loop – Window and Door  Replacement  1823 Tramway Terrace Loop – Window and Door  Replacement  1871 San Bernardino Avenue – Reroof  1909 Quail Run Drive – Paint Wall, Trim and  Garage Door  2509 Tramway Terrace Court – Raise Wall  2510 Tramway Terrace Court – Landscaping and  Garage Door Replacement  2518 Tramway Terrace Court – Raise Wall  2758 Cliffrose Drive – Repaint Window Trim,  Garage Door and Deck Cover  2897 Tramway Place - Reroof  7710 Cedar Canyon Place – Replace Shade Posts  8251 Raintree Drive - Landscaping  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       SEPTIC TANKS ARTICLE By Barry  Stone / Syndicated columnist, published:  Sunday, October 5, 2014 at 12:02 am     DEAR BARRY: I have some questions about  maintaining a septic tank. Someone told me to  have my tank pumped every one to two years.  Someone else said, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix  it.” I’ve also been told that pumping can  disturb the solids, causing them to seep into  the leach lines and clog the system. My system  is 12 years old and has never been pumped.  What is your advice? Ken    Dear Ken: There are differing views about how  often to pump a septic system. One to two years  is a needless waste of money. Every five years is  a more reasonable routine. If the bacterial  environment in the tank is good, solids should  continue to decompose, even if you wait an extra  year or two. Maintaining the bacteria level can be  done simply and inexpensively by flushing a  special product down the toilet once a month.     If the leach field is in good condition, liquids  should continue to be absorbed into the earth. The  idea that pumping will clog the leach field is  unfounded; pumping removes the solids before  they can flow downstream into the leach lines.     If you’ve gone 12 years without having your  system pumped and inspected, you should call a  qualified septic contractor soon. Neglecting  regular maintenance can cause deterioration of  the tank.

Continued from page 8    In some cases, this can lead to major damage requiring total replacement. What’s more, if solids  build up to the overflow level in the tank, the leach field can become clogged, requiring thousands of  dollars for a new field. The choice is simple: hundreds of dollars for maintenance or thousands of  dollars for repairs.   Bernalillo County Ordinance regarding animals:    The Bernalillo County Ordinance No. 88-16 Section VI.
