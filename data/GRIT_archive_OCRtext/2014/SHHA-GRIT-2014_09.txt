Along with the rain comes  growth of weeds and plants. All of the  covenants have wording that addresses  landscaping and natural vegetation.   However, many residents have different  opinions on what is acceptable landscaping,  what is out of control weeds, and what is  just natural vegetation growth spurred on by  the wet weather. The CSC will not interpret  what a developer or builder may have meant  by “landscaping” in a particular Unit. We  will try to view all Units in the same manner  and handle complaints accordingly. This, of  course, may not satisfy everyone. One  person’s weeds are another’s natural  landscaping. The CSC, in responding to  complaints, will try to determine if any  corrective action is required.    SHHA is not a property manager.    SHHA is a volunteer organization and the  Board of Directors and committees are run  by volunteers. We charge very nominal  dues. The covenants are legal agreements  that apply to individual Units and can only  be changed by individual Unit homeowners  (there are no overall SHHA covenants).  While the SHHA office maintains regular  hours, the Board and committee volunteers  are not on 24/7 duty. We do, however, try to  respond to your concerns in a timely  manner. The system works well if  homeowners respect their neighbors’ rights  and if there is a violation, take corrective  action when they are made aware of the  problem. We have limited powers of  enforcement – usually requiring expensive  legal action and time, so please help us out  by correcting issues voluntarily.    Thanks for Volunteering  At the August 5th CSC meeting, four  volunteers were added to the Covenant  Support Committee. We thank these  volunteers for stepping up and getting  involved!   Renters and Membership  Benefits:    Did you know that people renting houses in  Sandia Heights can participate in many of  the benefits of SHHA membership? All that  is needed is for the property owner to  maintain membership in SHHA. Many  property owners mistakenly believe that if  they move from Sandia Heights and rent  their house to another family, they must  cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be  collected as part of the monthly utility bill  for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to  the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible  for all SHHA membership benefits except  voting privileges and filing covenant  violation complaints. Tram passes are  among the most popular member benefits,  so be sure you maintain your membership so  your tenants can experience some of the  great “perks” of living in Sandia Heights!   New Development  Announcement:      The Monday Aug 11 Mhoon appeal hearing  was postponed (deferred) because of  problems with newly installed sound system  in the remodeled Vincent Griegos  Chambers, One Civic Plaza. The new  hearing date will be posted on the SHHA  website when we are notified by the County.    4   The GRIT – September 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 9                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

Please be on the lookout for these types of incidents and promptly report them to  the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department at 798-7000 and to Sandia Heights  Security at 856-6347 or 263-4654. Be vigilant in retrieving your mail as soon as it  is delivered and if at all possible drop off any outgoing mail at the nearest post  office.    Did You Know...? That the mail carrier does not have to stop at your mailbox when there is no  mail to be delivered, even if your flag is up and you have outgoing mail to be picked up? If the  carrier does take your outgoing mail when there is none to be delivered, it is being done as a  courtesy. (Note: This does not apply when you have scheduled a pick-up for Priority Mail.) If you  absolutely need something to go out, and do not always get mail, you should take it to the collection  box at the old Circle K (Tramway Blvd & Tramway Ln, in front of the Outpost ice skating rink).  The only pick-up time is 3:30 PM, Mon-Fri (no more Saturday or 4 PM pick-ups).     Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants, which state in general: “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said  containers to be concealed from public view . . .”  Please, when your trash and recyclables have been  collected, return your bins to storage out of public view.

We have  posted the entire publication on the SHHA  website. Here are a few of the ideas.  Keeping trees healthy requires a different  watering technique than watering shrubs, xeric  plants or grass.  Albuquerque has the third  most difficult climate in the U.S. in which to  grow trees.  Any trees that you wish to plant  should be well suited to the New Mexico  climate and have some drought tolerance.  If  you are planting new trees choose those that  are younger and make sure the roots spread  out radially from the bottom of the trunk.  In a  properly planted tree, the roots spread out  through the soil in a pattern that actually  matches the drip line of the branches.  If there  is something in the ground, like a wall or  embedded rocks, which prevents the roots  from growing properly, the tree won’t be able  to get enough water and the roots won’t grow  out widely enough to stabilize the tree.  Do not  bury the bottom of the trunk above where the  roots come out as you plant the tree.  If you have a watering system installed you  should be prepared to water a wide area  around the tree and plan to move the irrigation  nozzles out as the tree grows so that the water  is most plentiful just outside the root perimeter  – this encourages healthy root growth.  The  full article posted on the SHHA website  discusses the difference between watering  grass and watering trees and also emphasizes  the importance of using a natural mulch rather  than black plastic and “permeable” ground  cloth around the trees.  The article has a lot more information than we  can fit in here, including some clever ideas on  tree irrigation systems.  Please go to  www.sandiahomeowners.org and click on the  “Outdoors” tab and follow the link to the  article entitled “Keep Your Trees Healthy”  under “Related Information” on the right hand  side.   Letters to the Editor is a feature where  we provide a means of presenting relevant and  topical issues\opinions within the community.  However, we reserve the right to limit based  on space and relevancy.

We encourage civil discourse on issues  within the community and will continue to  publish relevant letters.   On – Street Parking Etiquette  Most of the roads in Sandia Heights are fairly  narrow (18 to 24 feet wide). Many do not have  curbs or have steep contour changes. When  residents have parties or yard sales there is  often not enough room to park in the host’s  driveway so folks park on the narrow streets -   partially pulling off the road onto a neighbor’s  “property” and in some cases trampling the  vegetation along the side of the road. The on- street parking can also pose traffic and safety  issues if there is insufficient room for  emergency vehicles.  In looking at the County codes and in  discussions with the Public Works people,  there are some general guidelines and  ordinances to be aware of:  1. Most of the County roads in Sandia  Heights are within a 50 foot wide (40 feet  in patio home Units) County- owned strip.  This strip is called a right of way.   Although only 18 to 24 feet may be paved,  the remaining strip width is still part of the  County’s property. This is sometimes  referred to as the shoulder of the road. As  such, cars pulled off the road in front of  your house on the shoulder may still be on  the County’s right of way.    Continued on page 8   8   The GRIT – September 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 9                                                                                                      Continued from page 7  2. The paved portion of the road in most cases  may not be centered in the 50 foot right of way.   You would need a survey to determine the  relationship of your property to the County right  of way; beyond what is paved (a rough visual  indication of the relationship of your property and  the road can be obtained from the BernCo GIS  maps).  3. County code prohibits parking in front of a  private driveway.  4. A minimum of 10 feet of street width must be  left for free movement of vehicular traffic.  5. For streets not exceeding 24 feet in width, the  use of “no parking” signs may be installed by the  County at their discretion.   6. No vehicle shall be left on the street longer  than 48 hours without notifying the Sheriff.  7. The Sheriff will make the determination of  parking issues and may have cars towed if it is  felt that a safety issue exists.  Remember that there are utility easements that  also run generally in front of your property.  These usually extend 7 feet beyond the 50 foot  County right of way.   Anything installed within  that easement is subject to removal should utility  work need to be done.  Be a good neighbor and avoid guests’ cars being  towed.  If you are having a party, include guest  parking in your plans and invitations.  You might  want to talk to your neighbors and make them  aware of potential parking issues (better yet invite  them to your party – they may not notice the  extra cars parked in front of their homes).   If you  are having a yard sale you may need to put up  temporary signs to avoid clogging the road.  In closing, you might be tempted to install rocks,  timbers, or other barriers to discourage people  from pulling their cars off the road.  In many  cases these barriers are on the county right of way  (remember the 50 foot width) and you may incur  some liability with the installation of these types  of items.

Domingo Baca is a very wide arroyo with a portion of it running between  Morning Glory Road and Tramway Lane east of Bobcat Boulevard. Some residents may believe this  area is “Open Space” when in fact it is entirely private property.    When dog owners walk their pets along the roadways they are normally leashed and orderly. But  when they enter the arroyo some feel that a leash is not required. A few dogs become  overenthusiastic when unleashed and knock over bird feeders and trample the landscape.  The owners  of these animals have allowed their pets to get out of their sight and aren’t aware of the destruction  they are causing. Please respect this private property and keep your dogs leashed as required by the  Bernalillo County ordinance.   Please be reminded to check your listing in the 2014 Resident Directory and Guide and let the  office know if you have any changes or additions.
