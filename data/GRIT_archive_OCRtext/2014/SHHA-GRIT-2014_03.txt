A dry  winter and spring and a late freeze destroyed the  majority of the natural forage that bears depend  on to get fat enough to survive the winter, and  we had many more bears than usual in our  neighborhoods.  NM Game and Fish killed or  removed more than 175 bears, leaving probably  just a handful in the Sandias.  Some of those  bears gained enough weight to be able to survive  hibernation, but we heard reports of hungry  bears in the East Mountain area all winter, and  several starving cubs were taken to Cottonwood  Rehab in hopes of saving them.   This winter has  also been dry, and unless we get a healthy  amount of moisture in the spring, it’s going to be  another bad year for bears.      The hibernating bears will start waking up next  month, and they’re going to be extra hungry,  especially if the spring was dry.  It’s not too  soon to think about bear-proofing your property  and keeping trash stored inside the garage until  pickup day.  Put bird feeders away on the first of  April. If you still want to feed birds during bear  season, sprinkle just enough on the ground that  the birds will finish eating by midday.  Bears  will destroy bird feeders even if they’re empty,  because they know that bird feeders  usually  contain yummy seeds.  Look around your  property and make sure you don’t have anything  that will attract bears, like bird seed or pet food  stored outside, garbage cans kept outside, and  melon rinds in the compost pile.  Look for more  tips and information in the April GRIT.     2   The GRIT – March 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 3                                                                                                        Officers  President – Ann  Zimmerman  Vice President – Joe  Pappe  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Ann Marie  Caffrey  Board Members  Bob Bower  Sharon Evanich  Woody Farber  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Emily Rudin  Ed Stretanski  Dick Wavrik    Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor    SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org    GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit any  submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.   Annual Report from Parks and Safety  Committee  During the Calendar Year 2013 we had two Parks & Safety  meetings. Subjects discussed and worked include the following:   •  Checked on maintenance and other issues in both Little  Cloud & W L Jackson parks in our area.   •  Resolved issues with chamisa, weed, and trees in right-of- way issues with help of BC & NM road personnel.  •  Checked out many residents’ calls and concerns about Park  issues and various Safety issues in Sandia Heights.  •  Communicated via GRIT articles:    Dog Pooh and picking up behind your pet.   SHHA still selling bright Orange vest at a low cost to  help walkers be more visible to motorists.   Vehicle speed & parking, bicycles & skateboards,  pedestrians, emergency vehicle access, and road signage  planned this month.   Dead trees and fire hazards in Sandia Heights.  •  DEAD Trees & Shrubs in Sandia Heights are still a serious  fire hazard and the committee attempted to establish a  program to address this in 2013, but had to postpone  working on it when Land Development requests with hard  deadlines were submitted to BC. Deep watering of trees is  still recommended because of the extended drought.  •  Wildlife Information: It was a rough year for bears and the  bear population in the nearby Sandias took a hit. SHHA has  worked with BC and has installed signs on the east side of  Tramway Blvd at a half dozen major intersections in Sandia  Heights. The signs will remind residents to not feed or leave  food/trash out where bears can get to it.  •  OPEN LAND & DEVELOPMENT in Sandia Heights  area. BC received 2 requests for Land Development permits  in or adjacent to Sandia Heights. Special Use Permit  #20130036 (Futures property) was heard February 5, 2014.  Special Use Permit #20130039 (Mhoon property) is  scheduled to be heard March 5, 2014.  Because of the large  flood plain acreage involved and because of the history of  development attempts on this property, and the 2012 BC  Pedestrian and Trails safety rules for Tramway Lane, the  committee and SHHA desire input and guidance from  Sandia Heights members.    3   The GRIT – March 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 3                                                                                                      Annual Report from the  Community Service and  Membership Committee    The Committee presented the following  events and benefits for Association  members:  Children’s event held:   Easter Hunt – March 2013 Attendance: 167  adults, 120 kids: Total 287   Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert  Series:  January 2013 – 111 members and 13  nonmembers attended  April 2013 – 109 members and 7  nonmembers attended  September 2013 – 107 members attended  and 15 nonmembers attended  Tram Pass program:   Eight passes were available daily in 2013 up  from six passes in 2012. 2299 passes used,  405 unused, 85% usage rate.

Thanks for helping keep Sandia  Heights a beautiful place for all of us to live.       Parks & Safety Committee ~ By George Connor, Chairman     A Word to the Wise - BE CAREFUL about TELEPHONE Scams  One of our Sandia Heights residents has reported a disturbing phone call which she wanted to share  with our neighbors. The caller spoke to her by name but didn’t identify himself. He informed her  that he would have a crew on her street the next day that could check her roof for wind and hail  damage. She pointed out that we hadn’t had any rain in over two months and asked him the name of  his company. He avoided her question and wanted to know how old her roof is. Then he told her that  his crew would be on her roof the next day checking for damage. She had not given him permission  to do this. When she pressed him for the name of his company and how he obtained her number, he  hung up. Sandia Heights Security reports that they have been contacted by another resident with  information about a similar scam. If you are a subscriber to Sandia Heights Security they are always  willing to watch your house. We need to be very careful when we receive an unsolicited phone call  from an unfamiliar name or number. Refrain from providing any information to the caller, and, if  you find a call that you do not recognize in your list of unanswered calls, resist the urge to call the  number back – especially if it is on your cell phone. That can cost you money.  ‘overseen orl worsen an enersement by HMA  [as S| a1.

While the CSC is glad to see the new  natural growth, we really do not want the  spring and summer "toys" to sprout. It is  against the covenants to park these units on  your property. When you moved into Sandia  Heights you agreed to a set of rules. Even if  you are renting, the owner or property  manager should have made you aware of the  covenants (copies are available at the SHHA  office) and that you must abide by them. We  ask for your cooperation in keeping the toys  at an off-site parking area (i.e., storage  facility). We know this is inconvenient and  most of us like to look out our window and  see our stuff knowing it is just steps away  from the weekend use. Unfortunately the  satisfaction of this view is not shared by  your neighbors - resulting in complaints to  the CSC. So please plan ahead and do not  bring the prohibited rolling stock into Sandia  Heights for either long term or short term  parking.         Odds & Ends from Parks &  Safety Committee ~  By George Connor, Chairman    Here are some Pedestrian Safety Reminders.   These are so very important, especially  walking against traffic and having light  clothes and reflective material after dark.  It  is unfortunate that some folks just won’t do  this – it’s baffling. Please, please, please  follow the safety reminders below.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders   Walk Facing Traffic; make eye  contact with drivers approaching  you.   Wear reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening.    If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.   Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single  file.      Construction Courtesy and  Safety in Sandia Heights ~  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC    This is the time of year when much of the  heavy outdoor construction efforts  commence here in Sandia Heights.   Although some of the following points are  included in the construction approval letters  sent to the applicant, experience has shown  that a few of these points need additional  emphasis and that other items not included  in the approval letters need to be addressed.   When you have significant construction  efforts underway at your property, please  consider the following points as a matter of  courtesy to your neighbors and for the safety  of the community:    1. Please limit all noisy work to between 8  AM and 6 PM, Mondays through  Saturdays and try not to schedule  exterior work on Sundays.  If your  project involves significant amounts of  up-front excavation, please consider not  performing these activities on holidays  or weekend days.  2. Control your construction trash by using  appropriate trash containers so our local  winds don’t scatter the trash outside the  borders of your property.  Make sure that  the containers are periodically emptied  and, if possible, not placed in the street.      Continued on Page 8    8   The GRIT – March 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 3                                                                                                        Continued from page 7    If your contractor is building your home or  addition using “green code” standards, this  code prevents the use of on-site trash  dumpsters.  Excess construction materials  are required to be placed in piles instead of  in dumpsters to allow easier access to  reusable materials. Contractors should,  however, use appropriate trash containers  for materials not associated with the  construction (lunch trash, etc.).  3. Make sure your contractors provide  receptacles for the safe disposal of smoking  materials such as cigarettes. Just like 2013,  this spring and summer may be the driest in  many years and we don’t need wildfires  caused by the careless discarding of  cigarettes at a construction site.  Please pay  extra attention to this item!  4. Don’t allow your contractors to dump used  concrete, stucco “swill”, or other  construction materials on empty lots or  down street gutters, into storm drains, or on  AMAFCA or County-controlled properties  such as water diversion channels.  If this  happens, you may get stuck with cleanup  costs.  5. Please don’t allow your contractors to  create on-street traffic problems by parking  too many vehicles on the sides of our  narrow roads.  6. Ask your contractors to limit the use of  radios and boom boxes that create  excessive amplified music at the  construction site.  7. Make sure that your contractors maintain  proper sanitary facilities on site for use by  workers at all times.    Remember to stay involved with your  construction effort.  If you see issues such as  those listed above, take action to correct any  situation that you feel may create a safety issue  to the community or be an annoyance to your  neighbors.          ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   725-18 Tramway Vista Drive – Landscaping  726-13 Tramway Vista Drive – Re-roof &  Skylight Replacement  882 Tramway Lane Court – Reroof  988 Lynx Loop – Driveway & Landscaping  1177 Laurel Loop - Landscaping  1502 Eagle Ridge Road – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  2510 Tramway Terrace Court – Re-roof  6102 Bluebird Lane – Outdoor Utility Staircase  12622 Colony Place – Hut Tub installation  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.      Letter to the editor:    To All Sandia Heights Residents     I am a member of the Sandia heights Homeowners  Association and a volunteer with the State Health  Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP).
