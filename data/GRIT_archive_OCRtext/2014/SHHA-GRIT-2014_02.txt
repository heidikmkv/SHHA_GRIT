Please consider volunteering for a  position on the Board. Even if you don’t  have experience volunteering with  homeowners’ associations, you are welcome  to join us, and we’ll help you learn the  ropes. Qualifications include a desire to help  the community, time and willingness to  work (yes, being a member of the Board  does take time and requires work!), and  ability to work well with other people. You  can pick up a Statement of Interest at the  SHHA office (or our office staff will  cheerfully e-mail a copy to you). If you  don’t have the time to serve on the Board,  we encourage you to volunteer for one of  our committees. You can find a description  of the committees on the SHHA website in  the Residents’ Guide. The Residents’ Guide  is also in the SHHA Residents’ Directory  and Guide. We’re looking for interested  people with ideas and the time to be an  active committee member. The time  commitment varies by committee, so check  them out and talk to the committee chairs for  more details.      Communications & Publications  Committee ~ By George Connor,  Acting Chair, C&P    Letters to the Editor is a feature  where we provide a means of presenting  relevant and topical issues\opinions within  the community. However, we reserve the  right to limit based on space and relevancy.   When a topic has been fully explored,  discussed and a decision made we will  consider it no longer relevant and will cease  publication of letters on that issue. Also,  letters must be free of personal attacks and  they must center just on the topic at  hand. We encourage civil discourse on  issues within the community and will  continue to publish relevant letters.      Septic Tank Quick Tips    For more details, read the US  Environmental Protection Agency’s A  Homeowner’s Guide to Septic Systems   Spread out laundry loads during the  week-don’t do all the laundry on the  same day.   Minimize the amount of household  cleaners you send down the drain,  and use less toxic products.   Don’t use the garbage disposal for  excessive amounts of food waste.   Use the proper type of bathroom  tissue. Septic-friendly tissue  disintegrates quickly in water into  many small fragments.   Don’t flush anything down the toilet  except septic-friendly bathroom  tissue and human waste.      4   The GRIT – February 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 2                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime,  along with the assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and  burglaries.  Consider the following prevention tips as well as ways to retrieve any lost or stolen  property.       Establish trusted relationships with neighbors on your block.  Agree to watch out for each  other and report any suspicious activity in and around your home.  Remember, residential  burglaries statistically occur during the day, so if possible, identify trusted neighbors who  might be home during this time.        Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants which state in general:    “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said  containers to be concealed from public view . . . “   Please, when your trash and recyclables have  been collected, return your bins to storage out of public view.

We have received  complaints of homeowners listing their  homes on B&B websites for room rental by  the day, week, or month.  However, Sandia  Heights is zoned Residential (single family)  and therefore renting rooms is a Bernalillo  County zoning violation. The Unit  Covenants also prohibit renting rooms.    The CSC therefore asks that homeowners  comply with both the Covenants and the  zoning regulations and not rent out rooms. If  you have already posted your house on a  B&B web site please remove it. If you  suspect that a neighbor is renting out space  in their home please contact the SHHA and  they will help you fill out a complaint. We  will immediately investigate and seek  compliance either voluntarily or with the  help of the County Zoning Department, or  other legal channels. Aside from the code  and covenant violations it is also a safety  concern for the neighborhood. Sandia  Heights Security monitors unfamiliar cars  and activities in order to preserve the safety  of the residents. Remember, this is a Single  Family Residential Area.  Please help keep it  that way.        Parks & Safety Committee ~   By George Connor, Chairman P&S    We are very pleased to see many of you  walking on the correct side of the street  when out on our roads.  However, there are  still a few of you who are walking on the  wrong side.  Remember, if you cannot make  eye contact with oncoming drivers, you are  not walking on the correct side of the road.   Also, although wearing a reflective vest is  unnecessary during the daylight hours, it  becomes very important early in the  morning, near dusk and later in the evening.   It is wonderful to see how many of our  neighbors are improving their health by  making the effort to walk out of doors a  little more!  Let’s also work at making our  neighborhood a friendlier place by smiling  and waving at our neighbors as they drive by  us.  A smile can really brighten your day as  well as that of others!    Reminders to hikers and dog walkers:  1. Help keep our county water supply  clean and use one of the Sandia  Heights dog waste bag dispensers and  waste disposal stations at one of our  neighborhood parks or at Domingo  Baca Arroyo.  2. We still have orange  reflective vests for sale  in the SHHA office at a  low price.       Reminders to drivers:   1. Be extra vigilant when driving our  curvy roads,   2. Watch your speed and go no faster  than the posted speed limits, and  3. Watch for pedestrians and cyclists on  the trail when turning onto or off of  Tramway Blvd.    Contact the SHHA office by email or phone  if you have any Park or Safety concerns. We  will either address them or let you know  whom to contact at Bernalillo County about  your concern. BE SAFE and ENJOY our  wonderful neighborhood.    8   The GRIT – February 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 2                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   28 Cedar Hill Place – Stairwell Addition  59Juniper Hill Court – Cantilevered Carport  218 Spring Creek Lane – Garage Addition  638 Cougar Loop – Windows and Doors  Replacement  785-3 Tramway Lane – Photovoltaic Panels  868 #4 Tramway Lane Court – Window  Replacement  991 Lynx Loop – Roof Repair  1015 Tramway Lane – Re-roof  1059 Red Oaks Loop – Replace Windows and  Doors  1502 Eagle Ridge Road – Roof Repair and  Garage Door Replacement  1515 Eagle Ridge Road – Re-roof  2035 Quail Run Drive – Install Gate  2321 Calle De Gabriel – Windows and Door  Replacement  2894 Tramway Place – Window Replacement  2900 Tramway Place – Window Replacement    11108 Bobcat Place - Landscaping  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       Choosing Your Contractor  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman  Once again, it’s time for my periodic article on  choosing a contractor for your home  improvement projects. Credit for this article  goes to Jessica Speck of JADE Enterprises,  Inc., a local contractor with many years of  experience in the design and construction  business here in the Albuquerque area.  It is  well worth reading.  Know who you are dealing  with when hiring a contractor—the wrong one  can cost you lots of headaches and money.  With our slow-growing economy and near- stagnant residential real estate market, many  homeowners are choosing to remodel their  current homes rather than purchase a new one.   But in order to cut costs, some homeowners are  hiring unlicensed and uninsured contractors.   These contractors can become a sizeable  liability to the homeowner through shoddy  workmanship or even by failing to complete the  remodeling task.  Keep in mind that contracting  without a license is illegal in New Mexico and  hiring unlicensed and uninsured contractors has  had a strong negative impact on the local home  remodeling industry.  There has been a recent rise of unlicensed  individuals entering the home remodeling  market equipped with a set of tools, a truck,  and minor remodeling skills. They deliver bids  to the homeowner at prices too good to be true!   Unfortunately, many of these individuals end  up getting hired for the remodeling job.  Remember the old adage:  “You get what you  pay for”, and this is very true for the home  remodeling industry.  The use of low quality  materials and shoddy workmanship can go  unnoticed for months or years.  The cost of  redoing poor work and paying for a licensed  contractor to build what was originally planned  for can be avoided by using some “up-front  smarts” when choosing the contractor in the  first place.  The lack of proper insurance is one of the most  obvious and devastating ways construction  costs are cut.  If a contractor should fall off the  homeowner’s roof, use faulty materials and  methods, or damage the homeowner’s home or  belongings, there is no coverage to protect the  homeowner.  In these circumstances, the  uninsured contractor cannot afford to pay for  personal injuries and other damages, leaving  the homeowner with an uncompleted project  and significant costs to settle claims against the  homeowner’s insurance policies.
