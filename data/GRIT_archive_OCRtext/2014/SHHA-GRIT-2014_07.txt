It has been provided  by the BC Project Engineer, Sara Chudoff.     To recap, well drilling activities occurred in  October/November 2013 in the right-of-way on  Live Oak Road between Black Bear Loop and  Black Bear Road.  The well is 640 feet below  the ground surface and groundwater is 581 feet  below the ground surface.  Water sampling was  conducted in February 2014.  The county  sampled for caffeine, cholesterol, nitrate, nitrite,  phosphorus, fluoride, chloride, bromide, sulfate,  calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and  pH.     Caffeine, cholesterol, nitrite and phosphorus  were not detected in the groundwater sample.  Results for the remaining constituents are as  follows:  Fluoride (1.8 mg/L)  Chloride (31 mg/L)  Bromide (0.33 mg/L)  Nitrate-as N (7.1 mg/L)  Sulfate (94 mg/L)  Calcium (110 mg/L)  Magnesium (15 mg/L)  Potassium (2.9 mg/L)  Sodium (32 mg/L)  pH (7.74)  I would like to sincerely thank everyone for their  patience with the county during the road closure,  as it was closed for a number of days and longer  than planned.  We appreciate all of the feedback  we received during the drilling operation.    Thank you for your continued patience with the  county for the duration of this water monitoring  project.

SHHA is  not a property management company and  cannot make or alter Unit covenants (and  there are 37 Units – each with its own  covenant). The Covenants are a contract  between the homeowner and the developer  as to what restrictions and use may be done  with the property.  Some things to remember:  COMPLAINT  1. All complaints must be formally  submitted on a signed form from a  member in the same Unit or adjacent  Unit.  2. The complaint should list the specific  suspected violation and its applicable  paragraph number in the Covenant.   Remember, it’s not what you wish the  covenants should say but what is  actually written that the CSC will make  a decision on.  3. Some complaints are best handled under  County codes. In general, the CSC  defers to the County for enforcement.  4. Some complaints take months to resolve,  depending upon how complacent a  violator wishes to be. So a long  resolution period is not an indication that  the CSC is not working on the  complaint.  VIOLATORS  1. The CSC does not “patrol” looking for  violations. We only act on written  complaints. So it is possible that your  violation can exist for months before  someone complains. However, once the  complaint is received we will  investigate.  2. In the interest of avoiding conflict, we  do not encourage direct contact between  a complainant and violator. If after an  investigation of a suspected violation the  violation is deemed valid, the violator  will receive written notification from the  SHHA to take corrective action [this  documentation is kept on file should  additional action be required].  3. Please – if you have received a previous  violation notification months or years  ago don’t do it again. We get a lot of  repeat offenders. Your covenants have  not changed so it is still a violation.  4. Tenants must also comply with the  Covenants. However, the property owner  is ultimately responsible for compliance.  5. Remember, you chose to buy your  property (or rent). The covenants were  already in place at that time. In fairness  to you neighbors please abide by them  and do not pick and chose only those  that you wish to follow.     Classified Ads:  1. 19 year old Academy graduate, currently  a USC rising sophomore is available for  babysitting, house-sitting, or pet sitting.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime, along with the  assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and burglaries.   Consider the following prevention tip:       Establish trusted relationships with neighbors on your block. Agree to watch out for each  other and report any suspicious activity in and around your home. Remember, residential  burglaries statistically occur during the day, so if possible, identify trusted neighbors who  might be home during this time.        Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants which state in general:  “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said  containers to be concealed from public view . . .”  Please, when your trash and recyclables have been  collected, return your bins to storage out of public view.  Thanks for helping keep Sandia Heights a  beautiful place for all of us to live.       ‘oversrena orl worsen an enersement by HMA  Doing What's Right for You  Selling Sandia Heights:Homes!:  ‘Sandia Heights Average Sold Prices vs. Other Areas 007 Avg SIS  7%  ‘Neighborhood 15 Avg SISF | % Change  Sharon McCollum ‘Tana Bke 15 Milos Dlr Pec (505) 269-6217 ‘SMA Qos com  Judson McCollum | enn ter 10Milios Dallas Peds (505) 269-3717 JhontBQeelcom  i ABQ Ac | $156.94 High Des sigiss | 135i ‘Sharon and Jdson McCollam have promoted Sandia Heights propery values for oer 25 years, We market to support  improving home values in Sandia Heights.

These requests include vehicle  speeding, vehicle parking which blocks road  access, bicycle & skateboard speeding,  children playing in our streets, blind spots on  our narrow county roads, etc.       Vehicle/Motorcycle speeding has been and  will continue to be an issue. The sure sign that  summer is here is the plethora of motorcycles  seen on the streets. Some motorcyclists who  live here in Sandia Heights have been using  Cedar Hill Road to demonstrate just how fast  they can go and pose a potential harm to  walkers and wildlife. Sometimes it’s the  unexpected surprises that can cause the most  harm. A few weeks ago two deer were  crossing Cedar Hill. Imagine what a  motorcycle/deer impact would do! Please, all  drivers and motorcyclists in Sandia Heights  observe the posted speed limits. The County  has posted speed limit signs, put in speed  humps (some like this and some don’t) and  continues to be responsible for the  enforcement.   Vehicle parking that blocks our narrow roads  is in violation of County ordinances. Speeding  or parking violations should be reported  directly to the BC Sheriff (non-emergency  #798-7000). In those cases where you believe  a County road is being blocked by parked  vehicles such that a fire or emergency vehicle  couldn’t get by,  no matter whether the parked  vehicles are on one or both sides of a road,  call the Sheriff. A Sheriff's deputy will  respond and handle the situation;   1. by giving a warning, or   2. by giving a ticket, or   3. by having the vehicle(s) towed, if  necessary.    Bicycles & skateboarders are with us in  Sandia Heights. Many bicyclists use Tramway  Blvd.  & Tramway Trail while others use our  narrow roads. We ask all residents to be  watchful, cars for bicyclists, bicyclists for  cars, and both for pedestrians. Just remember  that the visual image of a bicycle or a  pedestrian is much smaller than that of a car or  SUV. Also neighborhood speed limits apply to  both cars & bicycles. Skateboarding on our  County roads is allowed ONLY if the  skateboarders comply with the same rules as  Pedestrians. There is one Skateboarding park  nearby; it is the North Domingo Baca Skate  Park on Wyoming 2 blocks north of Paseo Del  Norte. There are more children playing in our  neighborhood as the weather warms. Please be  watchful for Pedestrians of all ages as we  drive around and through Sandia Heights.      FIRE SEASON IS HERE AGAIN!  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC  It appears that the local weather folks are  again predicting a bleak year for moisture and  for a higher-than-normal chance for local  wildfires.  As a property owner, you have  access to several good sources of information  that recommend measures you can take to  enhance the survivability of your property in  the event of a wildfire on or near your  property.  The best source we have found was  published by the New Mexico State Forestry  (NMSF) entitled Creating Wildfire-Defensible  Zones and is available at the NMSF website  using the following link:   http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/emnrd/biomass/ docs/Defensible%20Space.pdf.  Copies of this  brochure are also available at the SHHA  office.  As I indicated in the articles published during  the last several years on this subject, most of  our unit covenants state that “natural  vegetation is to be left undisturbed where  practical on all lots except for access to  property, clearing of building sites, and  establishment of lawns and flower beds  adjacent to buildings”.  The ACC has  published a Design Guideline for Landscaping  which makes the following points:  Continued on page 8     8   The GRIT – July 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 7                                                                                                      Continued from page 7  1.  Sandia Heights is based on an open space  concept where natural vegetation is of great  importance.  The deed restrictions for the area  require that natural vegetation be left  undisturbed where possible and replenished  after construction is finished.  2. Residents are asked to keep their properties  clear of dead trees and other vegetation since  this material is easily combustible.  The use of the terms “where practical” and “where  possible” gives you, the property owner, latitude to  make wise decisions based on your perception of  the damage to your property that could occur as a  result of a local wildfire.  Although SHHA strongly  discourages a “bare earth” policy as it pertains to  vegetation on your property, reducing the amount of  combustible materials near your home or your  detached structures makes good sense.     ACC Activity Log     Summary of Disapproved and Approved Projects  activity since the last GRIT:   16 Juniper Hill Road – After the fact Landscaping -  Disapproved  19 Cedar Hill Road – Repaint Trim, Replace Deck  and Railings, Window Replacement, and  Landscaping  32 Juniper Hill Road - Reroof  212 Spring Creek Place – Door Replacement  218 Spring Creek Place – Attached Garage  Addition  507 Black Bear Loop – Landscaping and Wall  511 Roadrunner Lane – Reroof  547 Black Bear Loop – Fill in Carport Walls  561 Black Bear Road – Portal and Swamp Cooler  Replacement  625 Blackhawk Drive – Patio Repair and Patio  Replacement.

Covenant Support Committee:   Your Covenant Support Committee (CSC) would like to pass along a friendly reminder regarding the  long-term parking of recreational vehicles (RVs), travel trailers and boats in the Sandia Heights  neighborhood.  Although the published covenants for the earliest developed units do not specifically  spell out RVs, the Second Judicial Court in the late 1990s determined long-term parking of RVs,  camper trailers and boats on all residential lots in Sandia Heights is prohibited.  The court allowed  parking of such vehicles for a period of no more than 48 hours for maintenance and provisioning.  The CSC does not police the neighborhood for violations; however, if a complaint is received, your  homeowners association and the CSC will act upon it with the full authority and backing of the  judicial system.  We would ask all residents with RVs, travel trailers and boats to be good neighbors  and respect the rights of other residents and adhere to the covenants.  Please keep in mind that the  covenants are here to ensure we can continue to live in a pristine community and maintain the value  in our homes. CSC Needs Volunteers    If as a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) and a home owner you  would like to continue to have your covenants enforced by the Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  in a timely manner, then you need to volunteer to be a CSC member. Please consider volunteering for  the CSC and help ensure the enforcement of SHHA covenants. Rigorous enforcement of our  covenants is your best guarantee that your property values will not be adversely affected. You can  volunteer by call the SHHA office at 505-797-7793.

Submission criteria:  o You must be a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association and you must be  an amateur photographer.  o Photos must be related to the Sandia Heights area (see the 2014 Directory).  o Photos must fit reasonably on the cover without loss of the composition.  o Photos must be in color, and may be submitted digitally or by email to  sandiaheights@comcast.net.  o The resident must submit a statement that the photograph is an original taken by the  homeowner, that he/she is not a professional photographer (in business as a photographer),  and that you grant permission to SHHA to use your photo(s) in the Directory or on our  website.      All hard copy entries may be picked up at the office once the Directory is published.
