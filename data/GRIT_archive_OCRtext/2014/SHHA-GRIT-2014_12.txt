We recommend you start working  now and be prepared to take advantage of  the following FREE pick-up service from  Sandia Peak Utility.    Twice a year, Sandia Heights Services  Sanitation group offers a special Free Green  waste pick-up.  The 2014 GREEN WASTE  FALL pickup is scheduled on your regular  trash collection day during the week of  DECEMBER 1 -5. Place green waste  (leaves, grass and brush, NO CACTI) in  bags weighing 40 lbs. or less at the curb by  7am on your regular trash collection day.   Branches must be bundled and cut down to 4  ft. lengths.  Limit ten (10) bags and/or  bundles.     Dead Tree Removal was mentioned by  multiple residents at the Feb 2014 annual  SHHA meeting as being a neighborhood  wide problem.  The SHHA Covenants  Support Committee (CSC) has described in  issues of this year’s GRIT, how to submit  Covenant Complaints (complaints are  always treated anonymously).  Some dead  trees have been removed this year as a  result.  BUT, there are still many dead trees  in Sandia Height’s neighborhoods and  member residents need to report any in their  units to the SHHA as covenant violations so  they can be addressed by the CSC.          Roadrunner Holiday Food Drive    Be a part of taking action this holiday season  and get involved in our food drive!

Below are some suggestions to better protect your mail:     Use the letter slots at your post office to mail letters, or give them to a letter carrier.     Pick up your mail promptly after delivery/every day. Do not leave it in your mailbox overnight.     Do not send cash in the mail.     Ask your bank for “secure” checks that cannot be altered.     Tell your post office when you’ll be out of town and have them hold your mail until you return.       SECURITY HOLIDAY TIPS:  With the holidays fast approaching, potential burglars or thieves  will prey upon targets of opportunity, and vulnerabilities exist that many don’t think about especially  during the hectic holidays. Here are some tips from the Sandia Heights Security Patrol:   If you display your Christmas tree in a window, don’t put your presents under the tree where they  can be easily seen from the road.  This is an open invitation for a thief.   When you return home from holiday shopping, pull your car into the garage  and close the garage door before unloading your gifts from the trunk.  If it is  not possible to do this, take a look around before you unload the vehicle.   Never leave gifts in the trunk or back of your vehicle outside overnight.  If  someone will go to the trouble to steal your stereo or other valuables, they  will certainly try to take what is out of the trunk or backseat as well.   If you must leave vehicles parked in a driveway or on the street, remove the  garage door opener.     Contact the Sandia Heights Security Patrol for a special security watch if you are going to be away  from your home.  This service is available to security subscribers, so if you are not a subscriber  contact our office at 505-856-6419 to sign up today!!

These changes are  aimed at preventing groundwater pollution  caused by aging septic systems.  The  Commissioners endorsed the statement by  Commissioner Stebbins that “Septic systems  are a significant source of groundwater  pollution in Bernalillo County and we are  taking this proactive step to address  contamination before it happens and protect  our scarce water resources for future  generations”.  The revised ordinance will  impact our community since many of our  residences have septic systems that have been  in place for many years.    Specifically, the amended ordinance calls for:  -  inspection and evaluation of septic  systems more than 30 years in age;  -  repair or replacement of septic systems  found to be failing; and  -  a recurring five-year evaluation of septic  systems more than 30 years in age.    In addition, the ordinance defines  circumstances under which conventional (non- aerobic) septic systems may be replaced with  in-kind systems.  The County also has income- based financial assistance programs to help  residents with evaluation, repair, or  replacement of septic systems.  Residents  interested in reading the full ordinance can  visit the County website, www.bernco.gov.                Covenant Support Committee   ~ By Dick Wavrik    It's Amazing  In spite of about four GRIT articles a year,  those of us on the CSC are always amazed by  the number of folks who continue to park their  RV's, and Camper Trailers on their property.   We can only conclude that you either don't  read the GRIT, didn't read your covenants, or  just don't give a darn about your neighbors  and your neighborhood.  If you have  neighbors that fall into the above categories  please feel free to file a complaint.  The CSC  will continue to investigate and remind folks  to put their toys into storage.  Give the  volunteers on the CSC a holiday present and  move your equipment to one of the local  storage yards.  We know it costs money to rent  space but that's part of owning campers and  boats in a covenanted subdivision.  You made  the decision to buy or rent in Sandia Heights  so please don't pick and chose the sections of  your covenants that you will or will not  follow.    Complaint Process  When you file a suspected violation you will  receive an acknowledgement letter.  You will  normally not hear anything else from the CSC  until the issue is resolved. At this point you  will get a letter stating the "file is closed".   The CSC does not provide updates or progress  reports to the complainant.  Sometimes  resolution takes months and you may think we  forgot about the complaint.  Not so - Betsy  keeps a log of outstanding complaints and  reminds us when it is time to look at the  progress (or lack of progress).  The complaint  will never go away nor will it be closed  without notifying the complainant.    Unfortunately it takes a lot of time, letters, and  lawyers for some folks to decide to make  corrections.       The top complaints over the past 6 months  were:  1.  Campers, RV's, boats parked for extended  periods.  2.  Landscaping issues - either overgrown or  cut down.  3.  Light pollution - bare bulbs, floodlights.  4.  Unused/registered vehicles.   7   The GRIT – December 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 12                                                                                                     8   The GRIT – December 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 12                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   22 Eagle Nest Court – Restucco  30 Cedar Hill Place – Garage Door Replacement   35 Juniper Hill Loop - Landscaping  95 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  206 Spring Creek Drive – Restucco and Refinish  Trim  344 White Oaks Drive – HVAC Replacement  408 Live Oak Loop – Restucco  624 Cedar Hill Road – Kiva  711-32 Tramway Place - Reroof  727-5 Cedar Hill Lane – Deck Roof and Railings  and Gates  726-30 Tramway Vista Drive – Replace Furnace  Screen  744 Tramway Lane – Garage Door Replacement  830-A Live Oak Road - Restucco  865 Tramway Lane Court #1 – Reroof  865 Tramway Lane Court #2 – Reroof  Furnace Screen  883 Tramway Lane Court – Restucco & Door  Replacement  943 Bobcat Blvd. – Reroof & HVAC Installation  948 Deer Drive – After-the-fact Landscaping  990 Lynx Loop – New Fence  1466 Morning Glory Road – Recoat Stucco  1502 Eagle Ridge Road – Stucco Repair  1510 Eagle Ridge Road - Parapet Repair  1907 Quail Run Drive – Coyote Fence, Windows  and Door and Overhang Replacement  2186 Cattail Willow Drive – Window  Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.  Home Improvement Projects and  Legal Issues By Bob Bower, ACC  Chairman    Once again, it’s time to remind you of some  legal issues that you should consider when  planning your home improvement projects.   Here are some pointers that I’ve learned from  various sources. Is a contract really necessary?   The answer is yes.  Legal advisers strongly  suggest that you sign a contract with a  contractor that, at the very least, includes the  following:   The scope of the work, the total price, and a  progress payment schedule   The legal names of the parties and the  physical address of the contractor   The contractor’s license(s) and tax ID  number   The labor and materials being provided to  complete the job   The timeframe in which the project will be  completed   The homeowner’s responsibilities which  may include the selection of fixtures, paint  colors, etc.   The days and times the contractor(s) will  have access to the property    If a contractor will be using subcontractors, the  contract should state that all subcontractors are  registered and their license numbers should be  listed in the contract. Each contract should also  require the contractor to carry workers’  compensation insurance and show the  homeowner proof of that insurance. The  homeowner can call the insurer to verify that  the policy is still valid.    If workers are injured while on the job who is  liable? Injuries to independent contractors and  their employees are generally not the property  owner’s responsibility. However, exceptions  are possible such as if the homeowner told the  contractor that the electrical power to the work  area would be turned off and it was not turned  off.

For information please  call Sandia Heights Services 856-6419 or visit their website at  www.sandiaheightsservices.com       Continued from Page 8    If the contractor or employee was subsequently injured in such a circumstance, the homeowner’s  insurance policy would likely cover the situation.  However, it is wise to check with your insurer  to make sure that your policy covers such events.    Make sure you are covered for property damage caused by the contractor(s). Verify that every  contractor has general liability insurance in addition to workers’ comp insurance. Again, you can  call the insurer to determine that the policy is in effect. I hope that these pointers will result in a  successful completion of your home improvement projects and that those projects are free of any  complicating legal issues with your contractors.      Notice: any corrections to anything found in the printed version of this GRIT   can be found on the website.
