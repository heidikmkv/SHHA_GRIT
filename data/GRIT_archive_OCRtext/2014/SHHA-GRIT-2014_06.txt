I have held positions of committee  member and chairperson for the Community  Service and Membership, SHHA Board  member, and SHHA President. I have submitted  my resignation to the Board effective May 23,  2014. My husband and I are moving to Whidbey  Island in the state of Washington. Many of you  are aware of one of my health problems. I have  needed to get myself to a lower altitude, and  Whidbey will certainly solve this problem.  We put our house on the market, and it sold in  four days. That is a record for us, in our nine  plus moves. After we accepted the offer, and  began to think about the move, we both had  bouts of anxiety and excitement.  The experiences Ed and I have had in the  community of Sandia Heights have been one, if  not the best, environment we have ever lived.  We leave behind the many friends we have  made, as well as the numerous acquaintances we  have encountered on our daily trips of walking  our dog Tootsie.  I am confident that I leave SHHA in the hands  of a very competent board and office staff. This  is the absolute best homeowners association I  have ever been a part of. I can say this because  Ed and I have lived in and worked with five  homeowners associations. If you have not had  the pleasure of being a volunteer with the  SHHA, I suggest, if you are able, offer your  assistance, as a volunteer, on one of the many  committees that need your help.  I take with me many wonderful and beautiful  memories of my experiences in Sandia Heights.  What the future holds for us in Whidbey, is  unknown, but the two of us love the challenge  that lies ahead.  A new Board President will be elected at the  regular June Board meeting.   Change in  Tram Pass  procedure:    SHHA has  purchased 8  corporate tram  passes per day. As  of June 1st the  passes will no  longer be free. The  tram passes will  cost $5.00 per  pass,                                                          there will be no deposits required, no refunds  and no cancellations.   Call the office for more details at 797-7793.    Fire Prevention  Because the fire danger is extreme, due to  continuing drought, and affects the safety and  welfare of Bernalillo County citizens and their  property, the Bernalillo County Commission has  imposed the following bans and restrictions in  the unincorporated areas of the county.  This  includes Sandia Heights:   As of March 25, 2014, the limitations and bans  will be in effect for the next 180 days.

L. Jackson  Park on April 19. It was a success in spite of the weather!  SHHA received a thank you letter from one of its members:   Dear SHHA,   Thank you so much for the fun Easter Egg Hunt. Our 9 grandchildren  and parents enjoyed the anticipation and actual colored egg hunt. The  joy of their choosing their baskets, going to the park, and running  around to fill their baskets was wonderful. Then eating candy was  pure pleasure and a delight for them. Thank you for organizing the  egg hunt, the treats, the volunteers and well marked areas for ages.  Thanks so much,  Lori and Erik Carlson, SHHA members and Sandia Heights Residents    SHHA Membership Cards:  Check out the entire SHHA  Member Benefits Program at sandiahomeowners.org and enjoy  discounts at our supporting local merchants.

All that is needed is for the  property owner to maintain membership in SHHA. Many property  owners mistakenly believe that if they move from Sandia Heights and  rent their house to another family, they must cancel their membership  in SHHA. Not true!   Membership dues will continue to be collected  as part of the monthly utility bill for that address, whether the  property owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If you as a  property owner pay the bill, you are free to pass along the cost of  membership to the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting privileges and filing  covenant violation complaints. Tram passes are among the most  popular member benefits, so be sure you maintain your membership  so your tenants can experience some of the great “perks” of living in  Sandia Heights!  3   The GRIT – June 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 6                                                                                                      Parks & Safety Committee   By George Connor, Chairman  Tips For Cyclists  Even before hitting the road, make sure your  bike and body are well prepared.    Just like a car, your bike needs routine  maintenance. Check your brakes regularly  and keep your tires inflated. An expert at a  local bike shop can even do a complete  tune-up.    Make sure your bike is adjusted to fit you.  Again, your local bike shop can make  adjustments to optimize the bike for you.    Get the right accessories. Mirrors,  reflectors, a bell to alert pedestrians, and,  of course, a helmet. A headlight and  taillight are often required by law when  riding at night.    Your bike is in shape, but are you? Before  taking a long trip, start with shorter trips  and stretch beforehand.    Dress for the part. Wear light, reflective  clothing at night. For longer trips, dress in  layers. A helmet is great, but preventing a  collision in the first place is even better.  Follow these tips to do your part.    Be predictable. Always ride in a straight  line, as far to the right as safely possible,  but remaining visible to drivers. Don't  swerve, and use hand signals if you're  slowing down or turning.    Get personal. Make eye contact with other  drivers (in a non-creepy way) to ensure  that they see you, and they'll give you  more respect on the road.    Watch for hazards. Piles of leaves,  puddles, gravel and other dangers could  make you lose control of your bike. In the  city, watch for manhole covers, sewer  grates and other surfaces that can become  slick.    Obey the law. Since laws vary by state,  make sure you know the rules beforehand.   Red lights and stop signs apply to you,  too.  Tips For Motorists  Bicycles on the road are, by law, vehicles with  the same rights as motor vehicles. It's the  responsibility of both the rider and driver to  share the road. Here's a few ways to protect  those using pedal power.    Be patient. If the lane is too narrow, if  there's oncoming traffic, or if you don't  have enough visibility to pass...don't.     Reduce your speed when approaching a  bicycle. Even if there's a bike lane, an  opening car door, for example, may cause  the rider to swerve into traffic.    Don't honk. You could startle the rider.  Make eye contact and, if you make a  mistake, everyone loves a courtesy wave.    Be extra cautious of children. They can be  even more unpredictable and less aware of  the dangers around them.    CSC Needs Volunteers  By Joe Pappe, Covenant Support Chairman  If as a member of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA) and a  home owner you would like to continue to  have your covenants enforced by the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) in a timely manner,  then you need to volunteer to be a CSC  member.  The CSC has lost several of its committee  members over the last few months and is at a  point where it is difficult to continue to  investigate covenant violations without over  loading the members left on the committee.   This means some suspected covenant  complaint investigations may have to be  suspended or delayed until a committee  member is available to do the investigation.    Please consider volunteering for the CSC and  help ensure the enforcement of SHHA  covenants. Rigorous enforcement of our  covenants is your best guarantee that your  property values will not be adversely affected.  You can volunteer by calling the SHHA office  at 505-797-7793.  4   The GRIT – June 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 6                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.  Membership in SHHA does not include Sandia Heights  Security membership. You can call Security to confirm your membership with them.

Please make sure to close and lock all doors, windows and garage doors at  night to prevent theft and intrusions. Last month the security office received several  calls regarding suspicious vehicles. If you see one, please call the mobile number at 263-4654.    Albuquerque Police Department Crime Prevention Unit  - Residential Burglary Prevention   Residential burglary rates are generally dictated by the active involvement of individual citizens and  cooperative education efforts by neighborhood associations and other community groups.   Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime, along with the  assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and burglaries.  Consider the following prevention tip as well as ways to retrieve any lost or stolen property.     Evaluate your existing lighting and pay particular attention to access points such as  entry/exit doors and windows.  Make sure that each area has adequate illumination so that  your neighbors can see any suspicious activity occurring on your property.  Consider  adding motion sensors to lights in remote areas around the home.    Sheriff’s Department  Traffic Safety Reminder:    The Sheriff’s Department wants to ensure the recreational and traffic safety of  vehicles, cyclists, dog walkers. The Sheriff’s Department also suggests that  joggers and pedestrians carry a form of identification & emergency contact  information with them in case of an emergency.

Each of us is  responsible for maintaining our part of the  right of way. Please be reminded about the  dangers of thick vegetation along driveways  and consider cutting thick vegetation away  from the entrance/exit of your driveways so  that both you and oncoming cars and  pedestrians have better visibility.  As you know, the County has been working  closely with SHHA to cut along all  roadsides at a 45-degree angle in order to  help improve visibility. This has helped a  great deal, but it does not solve all problems  for pedestrians or drivers. We want to  encourage each of you to call the SHHA  office if you note specific areas where either  the chamisa is too overgrown or perhaps  signs are being blocked by trees and  vegetation at intersections. (The County  prefers to have one contact with SHHA for  reporting such nuisance areas.)  If you have a Siberian elm growing in the                                                      County right of way of your property, please  call the County directly at 848-1503. They  will remove the tree and treat it with Garlon  to prevent regrowth. (In this case, the  County requires the homeowner to make the  request directly to them, rather than by way  of the SHHA, to be sure that the homeowner  wants the tree removed.)    Covenant Support Committee    By Joe Pappe, Chairman  Most of the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants  address light pollution. This is done to  preserve the enjoyment of the night sky  from light pollution. Regardless of the  individual covenants for your Unit, the  entire North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia  Heights fall under the Bernalillo County  Code for light pollution. The code includes,  but is not restricted to security lighting,  street lights, landscape lights, building  mounted area lights, building façade lights.   In general, lights shall remain OFF between  11:00 pm and sunrise; lights on buildings  shall be mounted no higher than 16 feet;  lights must be shielded so the light is  directed perpendicular to the ground.  To see  the entire code and for exceptions, go to the  Bernalillo County Website  (www.bernco.gov) and look under  ordinances, Section 30-186. So, if you leave  your lights on at the entry, garage doors,  house floods, after 11:00pm and they are not  shielded they may be in violation of the  County Code. While the CSC does not  enforce County ordinances we will work  with folks to make them aware of the  options and try to get resolution. At night,  even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to  enjoy the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city  below.                    Letter to the Editor:   Little Free Library Comes to  Sandia Heights Neighborhood  As a lifelong reader and book lover, Sandia  Heights resident Paula Fromen has always  loved the entire book experience.

It’s located on the street  just across from the Sandia Heights  Homeowner’s Association offices on San Rafael.  The concept is simple: take a book, return a book.  Share the books with your friends. Leave notes in  them about that wonderful turn of phrase on page  123! We support literacy, learning and the  community of sharing a love of reading. The  books are always free because the library belongs  to everyone!   See the origin of the Little Free Library  movement around the United States and  internationally, read about the founders’ mission  and view a map of all the registered libraries you  can visit on the non-profit’s website,  www.littlefreelibrary.org. You may just find  yourself inspired to build your own Little Free  Library!  Stop by with a book you’d like to share, both  adult and children’s books alike. When you finish  a book, come see what others want to share with  you! If you see someone else there, pause to say  hello and ask what they’re currently reading. And  if Paula is in the yard, be sure to introduce  yourself!   ACC Activity Log   Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   25 Cedar Hill Place – Landscaping and AC  Replacement  102 Juniper Hill Place – Re-stucco  113 White Oaks Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  215 Spring Creek Place – Fence Replacement &  Landscaping  216 Spring Creek Place – Fence Replacement  306 Big Horn Ridge Place - Landscaping  361 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Windows  Replacement  449 Live Oak Loop – Repair and Repaint Garage  Door and Stucco Repair  635 Cougar Loop – Re-stucco and Paint Trim  698 Bluebird Lane – Recoat House, Trim, Reroof  and Window Replacement  882 Tramway Lane Court – Reroof  985 Lynx Loop - Reroof  988 Lynx Loop – Re-stucco Wall and House  1038 Tramway Lane – Reseal Driveway and Re- stucco  1123 Marigold Drive – Recoat Foam Roof  1172 Laurel Loop – After the fact Landscaping  1188 Laurel Loop – Wall & Landscaping  1197 Bobcat Blvd. – Sprinklers  1199 Bobcat Blvd. – Mailbox Replacement and  Repaint Garage Door  1210 Marigold Drive – Roof and Wall Repairs   1231 Goldenrod Drive – Garage Addition  1701 Quail Run Court – Window Replacement  1841 Tramway Terrace Loop – Re-stucco and  Trim  2028 Quail Run Drive – New Gate  2143 Black Willow Drive – Roof and Parapet  Repairs  2431 Goldenrod Drive – Patio Cover  2871 Tramway Circle – Re-stucco  2874 Brushwood Street – Bathroom Remodel  2878 Brushwood Street – Replace Wooden Gate  and Repaint House Trim  8201 Indigo Court – Wall  8207 Indigo Court – Re-stucco and repair  driveway  8236 Raintree Drive – Reroof  9103 Lynx Loop – Re-stucco  9115 Lynx Loop – Repaint Trim  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.      ‘Adtrents ol preset an endorse by SHHA  GREG LOBBEREGT  ASSOCIATE BROKER, CRS  ¢E6@ GREGLOBB.COM - 269-GREG (4734) WWW.ABQFORSALE,COM - WW.GREGLORD.COM  (=) Pane  Liye (Co-isrin WIT JOE JENKINS - OFFERED AT $500,000  ‘984 Lyx LooP NE - MLS 805886  sa tg tye 2,  ‘9 The GRIT- June 2014  SHARON  JUDSON  Doing What's Right for You  Sandia Heights Average Sold Prices vs. Other Areas  (505) 269-6217 $1720  ‘SMMinABQeul cn is ABQ AL $216.00  McCollum (505) 269-3717 sents com  Jedson  eh propery vals for ver  $268.90 FOR SALE.  $84,900 + MLS F813550 Se Soon MCeom Sandia Heights Ma How is the Sandia  arket  SOLD In Sandia Heights!  ictivity 2014  a Heights Market?  oor SOLD  40 The GRIT -June 2014    11   The GRIT – June 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 6                                                                                                                        Announcements & Notices:    Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.     Board Meeting – Wednesday, June 11 at 7pm in the SHHA office.    Happy Father’s day – Sunday, June 15    Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes, email alerts and contractor evaluation binder free to  members.    Committee meetings are posted on our website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.    Classified ads can be found on the website on the top bar menu under Classifieds.     Safety Vests for sale in the SHHA office. $2 per vest for members.     SHHA membership cards: do not forget to go to the website to get a full listing of the companies  that offer a discount!      BOBCATS   Of all the large predators living in or  near Sandia Heights (aside from  humans, of course, we have mountain  lions, black bears, bobcats, and coyotes),  the one we often see is the bobcat (Lynx  rufus). The wild predators have lived  here for eons, but only recently have  humans invaded their territory by  building houses and paving streets. It’s  up to us to adapt to living in wildlife  habitat, and that means we may need to  change our habits in order to coexist  with our wild neighbors. This article will focus on bobcats.  Like all predators bobcats are territorial, and typically have ranges of 4 to 10 square miles. They  are solitary, with males and females meeting only for mating. Kittens are born in the spring and  stay with their mother for 9 to 12 months. About twice as large as a domestic house cat, bobcats  usually weigh 15-30 pounds when full grown. The bobcat gets its common name from its short  “bobbed” tail, 4 to 7 inches long. It has long legs and big paws. The coat color ranges from an  orangeish brown to pale gray with black spots and bars on its legs and chest, and less distinct  spots over its body. They have black streaks on their cheeks and sharp ears ending in tufts of  black fur. Bobcats’ diet includes rabbits, mice, packrats, squirrels, birds, and sometimes insects.   They rely on their keen eyesight and hearing to locate enemies and prey, as their sense of smell  is not especially acute.  Bobcats hunt by stealth, waiting motionless and then pouncing.   Bobcats pose no threat to humans, but they have been known to take domestic dogs and cats.  Keep small dogs indoors and watch them carefully when they are out of doors. Cats should  always be kept inside, as they will fall prey to bobcats (and other predators like coyotes, owls,  and hawks) and may also become infected with plague if they catch infected rodents.   If you see a bobcat, there’s no need to call Animal Control or Game and Fish—just enjoy the  sight of this fascinating and beautiful creature. If you would prefer not to have bobcats in your  yard, then you should remove anything that might attract them, like bird baths, water features,  and bird seed. Water is an obvious attractant, but bird seed attracts the animals bobcats eat, and  bobcats go where the food is plentiful. We hope that a better understanding of bobcats will help  Sandia Heights residents happily coexist with them. They are truly amazing and magnificent  members of our wild neighborhood.
