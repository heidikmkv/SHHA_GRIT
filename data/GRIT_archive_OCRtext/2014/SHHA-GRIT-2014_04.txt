The Hard Road Trio’s  sound has grown from Steve’s love of bluegrass  rooted in his native Virginia, the beauty of  choral singing ever-present in Chris’ Minnesota  childhood, and the musical traditions of Anne’s  New Mexico family. Listen to their music on  hardroadtrio.com.      “Steve Smith is undoubtedly among the best  mandolin pickers in the known universe, and  combined with Chris Sanders’ marvelous vocals  and steady rhythm guitar, they light up a room  like the New Mexico sun.” -- Mike Shirkey,  GoodFolk Productions.

For years I've been associated with the  SHHA and I've watched both of these  individuals perform exceptionally at a mixed  set of duties and responsibilities. They  superbly handle all of the daily issues that  "walk" in the office. Everything from  homeowners needs, to providing full  administrative support to the Board. They  arrange and handle community meetings and  events, as well as most all of the  administrative documentation for the  SHHA. Without exception, I have watched  both perform these duties with great  professionalism, friendliness--and the ability  to achieve a solution to the tasks at hand. I  would encourage you to stop by the office  and say "thanks" they both do an  exceptional job and provide the SHHA with  exceptional service and dedication.   Employees with the capabilities of Sheraz  and Betsy are very hard to find---we are  very lucky to have them on the SHHA staff.   I for one want to say thanks for all you do  for the SHHA.    Sy Caudill, SHHA member and Sandia  Heights Resident      Letter to the editor:  Dog Attack    On January 8, 2014, my three grandsons  who have lived in Sandia Heights for ten  years were riding their bikes on  Honeysuckle when two dogs charged them  from an arroyo. The nine year old stopped  and was bitten on his upper thigh which  required medical attention and a prescription  drug for ten days, along with the suffering  and emotional trauma of the attack. The  owner of the Labrador was stunned that his  dog showed this aggressive behavior, he re- leashed the dog and took responsibility for  the incident.    I would remind all dog owners that the  Bernalillo County ordinance prohibits pet  owners from allowing their animals to run at  large, are to be kept on a leash and under the  control of their owner at all times, kept off  private property and to pick up their  animal’s waste.    For thirty five years we have lived on Pino  Canyon Arroyo and estimate 70% + of pet  owners turn their dogs loose and have  witnessed them chasing deer, rabbits, birds  and show aggression toward other walkers.  We are happy to see our neighbors use our  property for exercise but do get disturbed  when their animals are allowed to run loose  and their waste not picked up.    Please keep in mind that this land is our  backyard. Enjoy it, respect it, be responsible  so we do not have another tragic episode  because of willful disregard for the law.    Respectfully, Ron Grenemyer, SHHA  Member and Sandia Heights Resident      Tram CLOSURE:    The tram will be closed for  Spring maintenance from  March 31 through April 18.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to  prevent this type of crime, along with the assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and  sometimes prevent break-ins and burglaries. Consider the following prevention tips as well as ways  to retrieve any lost or stolen property.       Evaluate your existing lighting and pay particular attention to access points such as entry/exit  doors and windows.  Make sure that each area has adequate illumination so that your neighbors  can see any suspicious activity occurring on your property. Consider adding motion sensors to  lights in remote areas around the home.

There are about 40 different Units within the  Sandia Heights community, and no two sets  of covenants are exactly the same. This  diversity in our covenants makes  community-wide enforcement difficult at  best. In addition, the CSC does not have the  volunteer manpower to patrol throughout  Sandia Heights looking for covenant  violations. As such, the CSC has developed  procedures that depend on members of the  SHHA to report covenant violations.       Who can report a violation? First of all,  you must be a property owner in Sandia  Heights and be a member of SHHA in order  to submit a covenant violation form. This  form (Report of Suspected Covenant  Violation) is available at the SHHA office  and from the SHHA website. Your  anonymity as the complainant will be  shielded unless future court action requires  that your identity be revealed. Historically,  court actions of this nature are very rare.   Any SHHA member may submit a covenant  violation form, however, the CSC normally  will act on submissions from residents in the  same Unit where the violation exists, in an  adjacent Unit, or in direct line of sight of the  violation regardless of the Unit you reside  in. The CSC will exercise its discretion as to  whether or not to act on violations outside of  the normal guidelines.       What information is needed on the  violation form? Information regarding you  as the complainant is on the form since the  CSC may want to contact you for additional  details related to your complaint. The  specific violation and its location need to be  identified, along with the rationale  supporting your belief that a violation has  occurred. It also helps to identify the  specific paragraph in the applicable Unit  covenants that you think is being violated.   The form asks if you have contacted the  violator, but this contact is not a requirement  in order to submit the form. The CSC is very  sensitive about not creating an adversarial  relationship between the complainant and  the violator. You may choose to talk to your  neighbor to try to resolve the violation first,  but as stated previously, the CSC does not  require this one-on-one contact. The  last  item required is your signature on the form.   The SHHA staff will recognize electronic  signatures that include the member’s e-mail  address. The CSC will not respond to  complaints submitted by phone calls, notes,  or anonymously.       How does the CSC handle the  complaint? A member of the CSC will be  assigned to investigate the complaint and to  try to resolve it. The member first assesses  the validity of the complaint by verifying the  information submitted on the violation form.  If the complaint is deemed invalid the  complainant will be notified by mail and the  file will be closed.  If it is clear that a valid  violation exists, the member will complete  an investigative report. The violator will  receive written notification from the CSC  regarding the specific violation and will be  given a reasonable deadline by which to  remedy it. The member will follow up with  the violator to ensure that the violation is  corrected in accordance with the stated  timeline. If the violation is successfully  resolved at this point, both parties will be  notified by mail and the file will be closed.      Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – April 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 4                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    If, however, the violation is not resolved as a  result of the first letter, a second letter will be  sent to the violator with an additional timeline for  resolution and a warning that failure to comply  may result in legal action. If the second letter is  unsuccessful in solving the violation, the file will  be turned over to the SHHA attorney for further  action. Don’t put yourself in this latter position  by disregarding these letters—it’s expensive for  both you and the community to pursue legal  action!       Why should you care about covenant  enforcement? Resident surveys conducted over  the years have consistently indicated that the  primary goal of SHHA should be the enforcement  of our covenants. The covenants were designed to  benefit all property owners in Sandia Heights in  order to preserve and maintain the beauty, quality  of life, and property values in this unique  community. The SHHA and the CSC actively  seek your support for the enforcement of our  covenants. This is your community and your  covenants—take them seriously!     ACC Activity Log: Summary of  Disapproved and Approved Projects activity  since the last GRIT:   9 Eagle Nest Drive – Reroof  27 Cedar Hill Place – Deck and Fence  154 Juniper Hill Road – Door Replacement  328 Paintbrush Drive – Re-stucco  529 Roadrunner Lane – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  727-20 Tramway Lane – Solar Tubes  882 Tramway Circle – Re-stain Trim  938 Bobcat Blvd. – Roof Repair  960 Antelope Ave. – Heat Pump Replacement  963 Antelope Ave. – Landscaping  978 Antelope Ave. - Reroof  1140 Marigold Drive - Fence  1470 Morning Glory Road - Reroof  2305 Calle De Rafael – Window Replacement  2824 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  8231 Raintree Drive – Re-stucco  11108 Bobcat Blvd. - Landscaping  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       LANDSCAPE RESTORATION—AN  ACC REQUIREMENT   By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    Planning an exterior home project?  Your  landscaping is always a very visible part of any  home improvement project.  The ACC requires  homeowners to restore disturbed landscaped  areas either immediately after construction or  later, depending on how close the “end of the  growing season” is.  The ACC defines the  growing season as April through October.  Thus,  a project finished in June must complete  restoration activities by October of that same  year; a project completed after October must  complete restoration by the following October.   All plans for landscaping, whether for restoration  or improvement, must be submitted to, and  approved by, the ACC prior to the start of the  landscaping work.  The ACC expects  homeowners to comply with all stipulations in the  project approval letter as to landscape restoration  and improvement. These stipulations reflect  requirements of both the ACC and the covenants  of Sandia Heights.  Recently, several  homeowners have ignored the mandate to restore  areas disturbed by construction.  As such, the  ACC will now require a homeowner to submit a  landscaping plan along with the final construction  plans.  This information will help the ACC  understand exactly what landscaping efforts are  contemplated following completion of  construction.  Please refer to the ACC Design  Guideline for Landscaping for more detailed  information on this subject. The ACC will do its  best to ensure that our landscape is not degraded  as a result of a failure to restore areas that are  impacted by construction activities.   Kelly Taliaferro, cRS | Qualityng Broker ot oan Ly Dog Realty ss (505) 270-5552  «+ Sandia Heights Resident  «Ivy League Graduate  | Veteran- USAR, 1LT  « Experienced Investor  «Your Home, My Priority!

MAIL THEFT is still a problem. We recently were advised that a homeowner on  Tramway Circle had their mail stolen sometime early in February. Thankfully, a neighbor  found the mail in the bushes while they were out walking and returned it to the  homeowner. Residents are advised not leave mail in mailboxes, either incoming or  outgoing. If you have mail that would be considered sensitive, you may want to mail it at a  USPS office. Another suggestion might be to replace your mailbox with either a heavy duty locking type  or totally enclosing the box with acceptable construction and a lock to impede vandals as well as thieves.
