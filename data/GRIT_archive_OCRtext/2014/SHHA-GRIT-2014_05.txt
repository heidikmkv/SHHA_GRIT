      Septic Systems Tip... 2   Open Burning Restrictions … 3   National Flood Insurance Article… 7    c            May 2014                                                                 Vol. 30 – No. 5    Parks & Safety Committee   By George Connor, P&S Chair   With the  warmer  weather,  many SHHA  residents will  likely be out  walking and  exercising,  some with  their faithful companion, Fido. Remember dogs  need to be on a leash.  This is required by  County regulation throughout our community,  and is especially in our two neighborhood parks  where adults and children play. Not far from  Sandia Heights  is the North Domingo Baca off- leash dog park located at 7520 Corona Ave NE,  two blocks north of Paseo del Norte near  Wyoming. This facility is a large fenced grassy  area where dogs can run and play to their hearts’  content.  On another subject, if you keep dogs in your  yard here in Sandia Heights, you might want to  look at the Bernalillo County Ordinance  regarding restraint of animals. It is in the BC  Code of Ordinances, Chapter 6 – Animals, and  has some excellent and important information on  the subject. One interesting item to me was  regarding electric or invisible fences. It is in  paragraph (e) and is:   (e)  A person who uses electric or invisible  fencing designed to confine an animal to their  property must clearly post a notice in two  separate locations upon the property that such a  device is in use.   Chapter 6 in its entirety can be found at:  http://www.newmexicoanimallaw.com/docs/Ber nalilloCountyAnimalControl.pdf    On-line GRIT Newsletter   By George Connor, Communications &  Publications Acting Chair  The GRIT newsletter is posted on the SHHA  website, www.sandiahomeowners.org. Viewing  the online version is free. The printed mailed  GRIT costs SHHA members over $15,000 per  year and lots of trees! You can sign up to receive  email alerts and you will receive a notification,  including the link, when the online version of  the GRIT is available for viewing. The aim is to  have members consider viewing the GRIT  electronically instead of receiving the printed  version. The advantages, besides saving trees  and reducing mailing and printing costs, are  quite attractive: the electronic version is in color  and has useful internet links to passive and  dynamic internet pages. For example, we can, in  the future, include video and PowerPoint  presentations of events of interest to SH  residents. Also, the on-line version is higher  resolution. If you do decide to sign up for the  online GRIT you will also receive email alerts  regarding any activity in the Sandia Heights area  that might affect you, such as a wildlife alert or a  security issue. To sign up either email our office  at sandiaheights@comcast.net or call 797-7793.    Change in Tram  Pass procedure:    SHHA has purchased 8  corporate tram passes per  day!

For more  details, read the US Environment Protection Agency’s A  Homeowner’s Guide to Septic Systems.   Spread out laundry loads during the week - don’t do all  the laundry on the same day.   Minimize the amount of the household cleaners you  send down the drain, and use less toxic products.   Use the garbage disposal sparingly.   Use the proper type bathroom tissue. Septic-friendly  tissue disintegrates quickly in water into many small  fragments.   Don’t flush anything down the toilet except septic- friendly bathroom tissue and human waste.

These restrictions will remain in effect until  the Bernalillo County Fire Department  determines it is safe to resume open burning.  If you have any questions concerning what  is allowed and what is not, please contact  the Fire Prevention Bureau.   The Bernalillo County Fire Department has  zero tolerance for any violations of the open  burning restrictions. Bernalillo County Field  crews will issue a notice of hazard on the  first offense. The notice of hazards will then  be forwarded to the Fire Prevention Bureau  for further action and documentation. The  crew may call out a Deputy Fire Marshal to  issue a citation if the offender is a repeat  offender, or if the crews feel that a citation is  warranted. (i.e. burning without due regard  to safety).   The following types of fires and open  burning are prohibited in the unincorporated  areas of Bernalillo County:   Above Ground Detonation (including  fireworks)   Agricultural Burning    Bon Fires    Burning of Explosives    Campfires    Ceremonial Fires    Controlled Burning    Cooking Fires    Disease Control    Heating Fires    Hot Torch Burning    Ignition of Rocket Motors    Open Burning   Open Flames    Timber and Forest Management   Research and Development    Slash Piles    Smoking    Weed Burning    Charcoal broilers, barbecue grills, wood  and coal burning stoves used outside of  private dwellings are classified as  campfires are prohibited   Exceptions:   Cooking or heating devices that use  kerosene, white gas, or propane as fuel may  be used with adequate fire protection and  defensible space.

The CSC has lost several of its committee  members over the last few months and is at  a point where it is difficult to continue to  investigate covenant violations without over  loading the members left on the committee.   This means some suspected covenant  complaint investigations may have to be  suspended or delayed until a committee  member is available to do the investigation.    Please consider volunteering for the CSC  and help ensure the enforcement of SHHA  covenants.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime,  along with the assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and  burglaries. Consider the following prevention tip as well as ways to retrieve any lost or stolen  property.     Establish trusted relationships with neighbors on your block.  Agree to watch out for each  other and report any suspicious activity in and around your home.  Remember, residential  burglaries statistically occur during the day, so if possible, identify trusted neighbors who  might be home during this time.      Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a  violation of all our Sandia Heights Covenants which state in general: “Garbage  shall be placed in covered containers, said containers to be concealed from public  view . . . “    Please, when your trash and recyclables have been collected, return your bins to  storage out of public view.

April marks the beginning of bear season,  when bears start to emerge from hibernation.  They were ravenous after a long winter’s  nap without eating, so we hope that the mid- March rains were enough to support their  natural spring forage.  If not, we’re going to  see bears in our neighborhoods looking for  food.  It’s impossible to guess how many  bears are left in the Sandias, after NM Game  and Fish killed or removed 80 bears last  summer. So it’s up to us to protect our  remaining bears by putting trash outside  only on the morning of pickup, bringing bird  feeders inside and night (or not feeding birds  until mid-November), storing bird seed and  pet food indoors, keeping doors and  windows closed after dark, and harvesting  fruit as it ripens. Remember, LOCK IT  AWAY UNTIL TRASH DAY.  If you do  see a bear, leave it alone.  If there’s nothing  on your property to attract it, it will move  on.  If you see a bear in a tree, the same  advice applies—leave the bear alone. If the  bear is in a tree, it’s because it feels  threatened.  So bring your dogs inside, leave  the bear alone, and when it feels safe it will  climb down and go back to the mountains. If  you have questions about coexisting with  bears or other wildlife, call or email Kate  Fry, your Sandia Heights Wildlife Steward,  at 828-9618 or kfry4956@yahoo.com.       Parks and Safety Committee   By George Connor, P&S Chair  SHHA residents might in the future  encounter the situation of a mortgage  company refusing to make a loan on a home  in Sandia Heights that has previously been  mortgaged without the owner purchasing  National Flood Insurance.    Root Cause:  Most mortgage companies hire  third  party companies to provide them with  floodplain determinations, and these  companies can make an occasional mistake  because of the specific requirement for  having flood insurance. The specifics that  require flood insurance are if your structure  is in the floodplain, not if your lot is  partially in a floodplain. That means the  third party companies have to be very  precise and they may not always be that  precise. Since 1983, BC ordinances require  that all structures built in the county/ city be  built outside the floodplain as part of the  National Floodplain Insurance Program.    Any home built since 1983 is by definition  not in a floodplain.  Possible Solution: Most mortgage  companies will allow an applicant one  appeal.  Bernalillo County Floodplain  administrator Don Briggs suggested that you  notify the mortgage company that you will  be appealing. Gather material together, then  call and go visit Don who will help you  construct the appeals submission.   Contact information for the BC Floodplain  administrator is: Mr. Don Briggs; Telephone  848-1511; 2400 South Broadway SE, ABQ  87102; drbriggs@bernco.gov.  8   The GRIT – May 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 5                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log – Summary of project  activity since the last GRIT    Disapproved: 938 Bobcat Blvd. – Trash Bin  Enclosure  Approved:    20 Sandia Heights Drive – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation   48 Pinon Hill Road – Resurface Driveway  619 Cedar Hill Road – Deck Extension  726-16 Tramway Vista Drive – Landscaping &  Fence  727-20 Tramway Lane – Reroof  760-5 Tramway Lane – Reroof & Re-stucco  847 Llave Lane – Swamp Cooler Replacement  918 Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  938 Bobcat Blvd. – After Construction  Landscaping  1009 Tramway Lane – Reroof  1010 Tramway Lane - Reroof  1042 Red Oaks Loop – Recoat Stucco  1114 San Rafael Avenue - Landscaping  1421 San Rafael Court – Reroof  1441 Honeysuckle Drive – Deck Extension  1553 Eagle Ridge Lane – Re-plaster Pool  1606 Quailwood Drive – Library Box  Installation  1838 Tramway Terrace Loop – Door and  Window Replacement  1861 Tramway Terrace Loop – Retaining Wall  Replacement   1866 Tramway Terrace Loop – Concrete  Replacement  1867 Tramway Terrace Loop –Window  Replacement & Trim  1870 Tramway Terrace - Landscaping  1915 Quail Run Drive – Window Replacement  1925 Quail Run Drive – Resurface Driveway   1949 Quail Run Loop – Replace Garage Door  and Fence, and Resurface Driveway  2006 Quail Run Drive – Flagstone Walkway  2747 Tramway Circle – Stain Concrete  Walkway and Slab   2748 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement   2762 Cliffrose Drive – Storage Shed  7710 Cedar Canyon – Back Patio Resurfacing  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       Covenant Support Committee  Your Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  would like to pass along a friendly reminder  regarding the long-term parking of recreational  vehicles (RVs), travel trailers and boats in the  Sandia Heights neighborhood. This is not a  new issue within our community, and at times  becomes a major irritant for other residents.   Although the published covenants for the  earliest developed units do not specifically  spell out RVs, the Second Judicial Court in the  late 1990s determined long-term parking of  RVs, camper trailers and boats on all  residential lots in Sandia Heights is prohibited.   The court allowed parking of such vehicles for  a period of no more than 48 hours for  maintenance and provisioning.   The CSC does not police the neighborhood for  violations; however, if a complaint is received,  your homeowners association and the CSC will  act upon it with the full authority and backing  of the judicial system. We would ask all  residents with RVs, travel trailers and boats to  be good neighbors and respect the rights of  other residents and adhere to the covenants.   Please keep in mind that the covenants are here  to ensure we can continue to live in a pristine  community and maintain the value in our  homes. ‘overseen orl worsen an endorsement by HMA  SHARON.
