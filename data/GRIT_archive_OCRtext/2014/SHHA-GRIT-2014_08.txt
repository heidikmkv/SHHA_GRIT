The Covenant Support Committee:   If as a member of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA) and a home  owner you would like to continue to have your  covenants enforced by the Covenant Support  Committee (CSC) in a timely manner, then you  need to volunteer to be a CSC member. The  CSC has lost several of its committee members  over the last few months and is at a point where  it is difficult to continue to investigate covenant  violations without over- loading the members  left on the committee.  This means some  suspected covenant complaint investigations  may have to be suspended or delayed until a  committee member is available to do the  investigation. Please consider volunteering for  the CSC and help ensure the enforcement of  SHHA covenants. Rigorous enforcement of our  covenants is your best guarantee that your  property values will not be adversely affected.  You can volunteer by calling the SHHA office at  505-797-7793.   2   The GRIT – August 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 8                                                                                                          Officers  President – Joe Pappe  Vice President – Bob  Bower  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Woody Farber    Board Members  Don Aunapu  Meeko Oishi  Anne Manning  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Emily Rudin  Dick Wavrik      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor      SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org      GRIT Editorial Policy is:       Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit any  submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.     Bear Season is Here  It’s officially bear season, when we need take extra care to keep  bears wild and safe by not attracting them to our yards.  This year,  sadly, we have no idea how many bears are left in the Sandias.  Last summer, NM Game and Fish killed or removed at least 80  bears from the Sandias, which amounts to the majority of the  entire estimated population.  Late last fall Sandia Heights residents  were still seeing a few large males, and they may be the only bears  left.  We have an abundant acorn crop maturing, but ironically  there may be very few bears to benefit from it.    We who have chosen to live in Sandia Heights treasure our wild  neighbors and happily take the responsibility to live peacefully  with wildlife.  We hope that the bear population will recover and  continue to thrill us with glimpses of them.  It’s up to us to protect  the bears that have survived by keeping garbage indoors until the  morning of trash pickup, bringing bird feeders (including  hummingbird feeders) inside at night or waiting until November to  put out bird feeders, feeding pets indoors and keeping pet food  inside, and keeping doors and windows closed and locked after  sunset.  If you have any questions about bears or other wildlife,  please call or email Kate Fry, your Sandia Heights Wildlife  Steward, at 828-9618 or kfry4956@yahoo.com.    Tram Passes:    SHHA has purchased 8 corporate tram passes per day.

A  majority of the 25 plus Sandia Heights  residents in attendance spoke against approval  of this Zoning Change for development but  were not successful in convincing the CPC to  stop the development or to request the  developer to modify his plan significantly.      Near the end of March, some Sandia Heights  residents, filed an appeal citing various  reasons that the CPC decision should be  overturned by the BC Commissioners (link to  appeal application already on website).  The  appeal is scheduled to be heard at the 4 PM  Monday Aug 11, appeal hearing in the  Vincent Griego Chambers, Basement  Concourse Level II, One Civic Plaza, NW.   The appealing party will make a 20-25 minute  presentation and the developer will have  roughly equal time to make a rebuttal.  Then  the BC Commissioners will discuss and vote  on the issue.  Residents with feelings about the  Mhoon development zoning request are  welcome to attend and be seen in the audience  by the BC Commissioners.

Viewing the online version is free. Please be  reminded to check your listing in the 2014  Resident Directory and Guide and let the  office know if you have any changes or  additions. All changes must be received before  7 November 2014 in order for them to be  included in the 2015 Resident Directory and  Guide.  Grab it, Bag it, Toss it  Bernalillo County has begun a new campaign  to encourage residents to clean up after their  pets. The campaign is based on the theme  “There Is No Poop Fairy – Grab it, Bag it,  Toss it.” Residents are reminded that pet waste  should be picked up as a common courtesy to  their neighbors. The campaign seeks to dispel  the myth that dog poop is somehow natural  and harmless to the environment by pointing  out that over 450 tons of dog waste can end up  in the river each year through storm water  runoff – an amount which can have a  significant impact on water quality throughout  our area.             Healthy Trees    Sandia Heights Homeowners’ Association has  received some very useful information from  Karen Temple Beamish at Desert Oasis  Teaching Garden, on keeping the trees healthy  in our Sandia Heights gardens.  Here are a few  of the ideas.  You may access the entire  publication on the SHHA website.    Keeping trees healthy requires a different  watering technique than watering shrubs, xeric  plants or grass.  Albuquerque has the third  most difficult climate in the U.S. in which to  grow trees.  Any trees that you wish to plant  should be well suited to the New Mexico  climate and have some drought tolerance.  If  you are planting new trees choose those that  are younger and make sure the roots spread  out radically from the bottom of the trunk.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime,  along with the assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and  burglaries. Consider the following prevention tips as well as ways to retrieve any lost or stolen  property.       Non-forced entry burglaries are on the rise, especially during warm weather  months.  Eliminate this possible access point by closing and locking garage doors,  windows and front/back doors.      Establish trusted relationships with neighbors on your block.  Agree to watch out for  each other and report any suspicious activity in and around your home.   Remember, residential burglaries statistically occur during the day, so if possible,  identify trusted neighbors who might be home during this time.        ‘Adwetsomera do tt otsent an endorser by SHA  GREG LOBBEREGT ASSOCIATE BROKER, CRS “PROUDLY SERVING SANDIA HEIGHTS SINCE 1983!" ‘stn: GREG@GREGLOBB.COM ~ Cx11:505-269-GREG (4734) WHW.ABQFORSALE.COM - WW.GREGLOBR.COM  | EB Gers Rata  ~ ME  “i JuNinnn Hits Loon NB  505.269.

If  there is something in the ground, like a wall  or embedded rocks, which prevents the roots  from growing properly, the tree won’t be  able to get enough water and the roots won’t  grow out widely enough to stabilize the  tree.  Do not bury the bottom of the trunk,  above where the roots come out, in the dirt  as you plant the tree.    If you have a watering system installed you  should be prepared to water a wide area  around the tree and plan to move the  irrigation nozzles out as the tree grows so  that the water is most plentiful just outside  the root perimeter – this encourages healthy  root growth.  The article discusses the  difference between watering grass and  watering trees and also emphasizes the  importance of using a natural mulch rather  than black plastic and “permeable” ground  cloth around the trees.    The article has a lot more information than  we can fit in here, including some clever  ideas on tree irrigation systems.

When  Sandia Heights was subdivided, the  developer included these arroyos in the  individual home lots. In doing so it became  private property of the homeowner and in  most cases is recorded as an easement on the  plat. The arroyo may not be dammed or  water redirected and must be maintained by  the property owner. As far as Albuquerque  Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control  Authority (AMAFCA) is concerned the  homeowner can drive on it, park cars or  trailers on it, or clean it up.  It may,  however, be difficult to get a building permit  to put any structures on it.  There are additional use restrictions that  your individual Unit covenants may impose  on vegetation, parking, and structures in  your arroyo. So while AMAFCA may not  restrict your use of your arroyo, the  covenants may. Many of the covenants also  address water runoff from your lot and the  need to preserve the drainage plan filed with  the County before landscaping.    There are a few AMAFCA owned arroyos in  Sandia Heights, usually between Tramway  Blvd and Tramway Lane. These are owned  and maintained by AMAFCA. Should you  need additional information please contact  Ms Lynn Mazur, Engineer for Development,  AMAFCA (phone 884-2215).     SHHA SECURITY EMAIL ALERT  SYSTEM     The office has a security email alert system  that is available to all SHHA members  whose email addresses are in our database.

It is very tempting not to return  these vehicles to a storage facility when you  intend to use them next weekend.  However,  leaving them in your driveway or yard is not  permitted by your covenants.  Please be  considerate to your neighbors and after you  have unloaded your rolling stock remove it  from Sandia Heights.  [If you wish to construct  a garage to store recreational equipment, please  consult with the Architectural Committee to  discuss your plans before you start.]   Summer also brings out growth of the natural  vegetation and weeds.  Look around your lot  for dead trees and bushes and please remove  them.  If the tree does not have leaves by now it  is probably dead.  Although you may think it is  good for bird nesting or part of the natural  landscaping, your covenants generally require  you to remove dead trees and bushes and some  units require you to maintain your landscape.   Again, the CSC asks that you be considerate of  your neighbors and take care of your lot.            BioPark Bond Proposal for River  Otter Exhibit    For details please visit our website at  www.sandiahomeowners .org.

All that is needed is  for the property owner to maintain membership in SHHA. Many property owners mistakenly believe  that if they move from Sandia Heights and rent their house to another family, they must cancel their  membership in SHHA. Not true!   Membership dues will continue to be collected as part of the  monthly utility bill for that address, whether the property owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the  bill. If you as a property owner pay the bill, you are free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all SHHA membership benefits except voting privileges  and filing covenant violation complaints. Tram passes are among the most popular member benefits,  so be sure you maintain your membership so your tenants can experience some of the great “perks”  of living in Sandia Heights!     Notice: Any corrections to anything found in the printed version of this GRIT can be found on the website.
