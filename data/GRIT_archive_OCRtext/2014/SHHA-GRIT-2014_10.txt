Please vote “YES” for the  Recreational Bond Package (#3) in the November  4, 2014, Bernalillo County General Election.  This  bond package includes $2 million to support  construction of the BioPark River Otter Exhibit.  This can be our thanks to Albuquerque residents  for building, maintaining, and supporting the  BioPark facilities we all enjoy visiting. We will all  enjoy watching the antics of curious, playful, and  funny river otters.  Let us make this happen for the  BioPark and for us as well.

Rudin, SHHA Board Member  The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  expresses appreciation to members Linda and  Kerney Bolton for generously arranging and  producing the SHHA Coffeehouse Concert Series.  Thanks to the Boltons, hundreds of SHHA  members and their guests have been introduced to  and entertained by a diverse array of professional  musicians on tour. The September 13 concert,  which featured the Nashville-based Carolyn  Martin Band, marked the Series’ last event.  The Boltons first proposed the Series to the SHHA  Board in 2005 and, with Board approval, launched  it in 2006. Eight years and 26 concerts later, the  Boltons have concluded the Series.  “We moved here from the Boston area in 1997,”  Linda explains. “We had been involved in the  music industry since 1989, I as an artist  representative—or booking agent—for folk and  bluegrass musicians, and Kerney as a sound  engineer.” Among their clients were Jonathan  Edwards (whose hit song, “Sunshine,” earned a  Gold Record in the 1970s) and the New England  bluegrass band Northern Lights.  “Kerney and I traveled coast to coast with the band  for eight years,” Linda continues. “Our venues  included the American Folklife Center and  Smithsonian Institution in D.C., Strawberry Music  Festival in California, Zion National Park in Utah,  The Barns at Wolf Trap in Virginia, plus countless  concert series, church coffeehouses, and festivals.  Over the years we became personally acquainted  with many nationally known folk and bluegrass  performers.”  After moving here, the Boltons observed that  many Sandia Heights residents were reluctant to  drive into the city to see quality live music. “Since  we had come from an area rich in folk-music  coffeehouses held in churches,” Linda says, “we  thought it would be nice to have a high-quality  music venue featuring national performers that  people could reach in just minutes. At the same  time,” she continues, “a coffeehouse would enable  Sandia Heights residents to meet each other and  socialize. Since SHHA held its annual meetings at  the Church of the Good Shepherd, it made sense to  hold the Coffeehouse there.”  Continued on page 2  2   The GRIT – October 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 10                                                                                                          Officers  President – Joe Pappe  Vice President – Bob  Bower  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Woody Farber    Board Members  Don Aunapu  Meeko Oishi  Anne Manning  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Emily Rudin  Marion Simon  Dick Wavrik      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor      SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org      GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit any  submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.   Continued from front page  The high-caliber entertainers whom the Boltons brought to  SHHA—some for encore performances—included Syd Masters  and the Swing Riders, the Boulder Acoustic Society, Bryan  Bowers, Tim Grimm, Acoustic Eidolon, Robin and Linda  Williams and Their Fine Group, the Chapmans, and Spring Creek.  The Boltons have volunteered their talents to SHHA beyond the  Coffeehouse Concert Series. Linda is a member of the Community  Service and Membership (CS&M) Committee. Kerney has served  on, and chaired, both the CS&M and Architectural Control  Committees.  The SHHA wishes Linda  and Kerney well as they  pursue new ventures.

It is difficult for drivers  to see walkers and joggers. Please consider  the safety tips below:  Pedestrian Safety Tips   Walk Facing Traffic; make eye  contact with drivers approaching you.   Wear a reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening. SHHA members can purchase  a vest in the office for only $2!    If you are walking a dog, keep the dog  to your left.   Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single file.   If you expect to be out before sunrise  or after sunset, please carry a light.  Safety of our children on or near our  neighborhood roads. Please be aware of  children walking and/or playing on or near  our small, winding roads in Sandia Heights  before and after school and at school bus  stops.    Sandia Heights Septic System  Update  At its meeting on September 9, 2014, the  Bernalillo County Commissioners met to  consider approving an amendment to the  County’s Wastewater Ordinance.  However,  the Commissioners voted to postpone their  vote on the amendment and asked that the  entire Ordinance, including the proposed  amendment, be republished as a single  document and be made available to the  public for comments prior to a final vote by  the Commissioners at their October 28, 2014  meeting.  The Ordinance, including the  proposed amendments, is now available on  the SHHA website.  Public comments will  be accepted by the Commission no later than  Tuesday, October 10, 2014.  Keep in mind  that there may be some minor changes to the  Ordinance as a result of additional public  comments and discussions at the October  meeting.  The amendment to the Ordinance will affect  all homeowners in Sandia Heights who have  septic systems for wastewater treatment.   The amendment will affect four areas of the  existing Ordinance as follows:  1.  Septic System Inspections.  2.  Installation of Replacement Systems.  3.  Installations for New or Upgraded  Systems.  4.  Maintenance Contracts.  NOTE:  The  County has agreed to be available for  consultation if homeowners are required to  obtain a maintenance contract.  SHHA will provide additional details on the  four areas listed above once the Commission  votes to implement the amendment or makes  additional changes to the Wastewater  Ordinance.  4   The GRIT – October 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 10                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:  Please be reminded  that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle collection, and  security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association membership.

The  Holidays can be difficult for many New Mexicans. Food drives enable the food bank to provide a  wide variety of high quality, nutritious food items throughout the year. The Roadrunner Food Bank  of New Mexico distributes more than 22 million pounds of food a year to hundreds of nonprofit  agencies throughout New Mexico. Each one of us can make an impact.     We have already begun collecting. Please help by bringing non-perishable food items to the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association office located at San Rafael and Tramway. Please do not bring  open containers or boxes or samples. Office hours are Monday through Friday 9am - 4pm. Look for  the big red drop bins inside.     Most Needed Items: Macaroni & Cheese, Canned Fruits, Canned Vegetables, Canned Meats,  Canned Entrees, Cereal Bars, Rice, Sugar, Pastas, Soups, Baby Food, Boxed Meals. Plastic, boxed,  bagged and canned containers present less chance of breakage and less loss of good food.   MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE   FOR YOUR GENEROSITY!

Please  be advised to take your outgoing mail to the  Post Office. If the option is available it  might be best to have sensitive information  like checks, insurance and mortgage papers  sent to your bank branch and you can pick  them up from there, rather than having them  sent to your house. Likewise, consider  opening a post office box and have your  mail sent there. Otherwise, keep your eye  out for the postman and get your mail out of  your box quickly.   . Plague and Tularemia   By George Connor, Chairman, Parks &  Safety  Sandia Heights residents, please be aware  that both plague and tularemia have been  found in dead animals in our neighborhood.  Thus far, there have been no reports that the  diseases have been transferred to household  pets or humans. However, some pets have  been placed on an antibiotic regimen  because of direct contact with infected dead  animals. Exercise extreme caution when  handling dead animals: cover up, use gloves,  and be upwind of the animal.   Excerpts from the Albuquerque  Environmental Health Department website:  Tularemia has been found in the East  Mountains, North Albuquerque Acres, and  Sandia Heights. Tularemia is more active  April-October and does overlap with plague  in its seasonality and locality. Residents in  these endemic areas who find a rabbit or  rodent which died for no apparent reason  should contact 311 to have the animal  removed.  Preventive strategy:   Keep pets confined to prevent them  from ingesting infected animals   Regularly treat pets and their  bedding with flea and tick control   Eliminate rodent harborage such as  wood piles, or trash, bird feeders,  water fountains, etc.  For more information please visit the  Albuquerque Environmental Health website:   http://www.cabq.gov/environmentalhealth/u rban-biology/pest-management/rodents      Renters and Membership  Benefits  Did you know that people renting houses in  Sandia Heights can participate in many of  the benefits of SHHA membership? All that  is needed is for the property owner to  maintain membership in SHHA. Many  property owners mistakenly believe that if  they move from Sandia Heights and rent  their house to another family, they must  cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be  collected as part of the monthly utility bill  for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to  the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible  for all SHHA membership benefits except  voting privileges and filing covenant  violation complaints. Tram passes are  among the most popular member benefits,  so be sure you maintain your membership so  your tenants can experience some of the  great “perks” of living in Sandia Heights!             8   The GRIT – October 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 10                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   22 Eagle Nest Court – Landscaping  422 Live Oak Court – Garage and Shop  Addition  547 Black Bear Loop – Garage Addition  548 Black Bear Road – Retaining Wall  564 Black Bear Road – Resurface Asphalt  Driveway   624 Cedar Hill Road – Landscaping and Wall  664 Roadrunner Lane – Reroof and Re-stucco  711-23 Tramway Place – Repaint  Door/Gate/Trim, Parapet Repair and Re-stain  Deck  720-7 Tramway Lane – Replace Sidings  868 Tramway Lane Court #D – Reroof  995 Lynx Loop – Garage Addition and  Courtyard Wall  1046 Red Oaks Loop – Re-stucco  1059 Red Oaks Loop – Window Replacement  1105 San Rafael Avenue – Door Replacement  1226 Rockrose Road – Re-roof  1459 Bluebell Drive – Landscaping  1863 Tramway Terrace Loop – AC Unit  Installation  1911 Quail Run Road – Door Installation  2430 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence  Replacement  2431 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence  Replacement  2811 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  2867 Tramway Circle – Restucco   2871 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       Bernalillo County Road work By Joe  Pappe, SHHA President  Does your road need some clean up after a big  rain? All County work order requests should be  made directly to the Bernalillo County Contact  Center at 848-1503 or email:  contactcenter2@bernco.gov.   Street Right of Way Maintenance  By Joe Pappe, SHHA President  The County right of way usually extends a few  feet beyond the paved edge of the street into  Sandia Heights properties. Each of us is  responsible for maintaining our part of the right  of way. Please be reminded about the dangers  of thick vegetation along driveways and  consider cutting thick vegetation away from the  entrance/exit of your driveways so that both  you and oncoming cars and pedestrians have  better visibility.  The County works closely with SHHA to cut  along all roadsides at a 45-degree angle in  order to help improve visibility. This has  helped a great deal, but it does not solve all  problems for pedestrians or drivers. We want to  encourage each of you to call the SHHA office  if you note specific areas where either the  chamisa is too overgrown or perhaps signs are  being blocked by trees and vegetation at  intersections. (The County prefers to have one  contact with SHHA for reporting such nuisance  areas.)  If you have a Siberian elm growing in the  County right of way of your property, please  call the County directly at 848-1503. They will  remove the tree and treat it with Garlon to  prevent regrowth. (In this case, the County  requires the homeowner to make the request  directly to them, rather than by way of the  SHHA, to be sure that the homeowner wants  the tree removed.)   ‘Adwetsomera do tt otsent an endorser by SHA  GREG LOBBEREGT | ASSOCIATE BROKER, CRS “PROUDLY SERVING SANDIA HEIGHTS SINCE 1983!” ‘ut: GREG@GREGLOBB.COM ~ C11: 505-269-GREG (4734) = WW.ANQFORSALE:COM - WWW.GrecLOBs.cOM  9 The GRIT- October 2014 SHARON JUDSON  Doing What's Right for You  ‘Sandia Heights Average Sold Prices vs. Other Areas (605) 269.3717 abenibQention  (605) 269-6217 Tinoun | | suan.z5 [13.5 SaMeABQgwelen | Roh ABQ Aes sis6oe | 27.558  Sharm and Judson McColl have promod Sandia High propery vale for oer 25 ean, We marke © support Improving ome vals in Sala Height Cal (05) 20-621 for our FREE Mark Ana dat  [fete Te  263 lop mae NE 7609TnmmaylaneRE Speedin Seneca Sandia Heights Market Act  How is the Sandia Heights Market  DETACHED HOMES ON LOTS LARGER THAN SOACRES | _ DETACHED HOMES ON LOTS SMALLER THAN 50 ACRES = FOR SALE on lt larger There a homes FOR SALE al  $191.50, There hare been 24 homer SOLD on slang than | $16827.
