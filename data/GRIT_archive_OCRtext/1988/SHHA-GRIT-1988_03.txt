Confusing. That is the relationship between SHHA and the Tram  Company.  In the beginning was the Sandia Peak Tram Company. That was 1963.  Along about 1970, the thirty or so home owners in the various Sandia  Heights loosely formed an association, started a one-page paper, had a  contest to name it (Grit won, named after the British publication) and  elected officers. The all volunteer fire house was our main concern  and getting mail and newspaper service fo11owed closely.  From the beginning, the Tram Company took care of EVERYTHING.  They built the roads and maintained them, planted trees, erected signs  and all those things developers do in new neighborhoods. When storms  came they plowed the roads as best they could--which is more service  than Glenwood Hills, Four Hills and Albuquerque have even today.  When garbage co11ection started, the Tram Company charged those  homes that signed up and water was supplied by the Sandia Peak  Utility Company •. SHHA and the Tram Co. jointly decided a security  guard was a good idea and we individually signed up to help pay for  that. When the pool and courts were built, home owners signed up and  joined the Four Seasons Club if they wanted to.  Twenty years later, we have nearly 1400 families and the need for  more and better services to our home owners. For example, we need to  pay for regular plowing of the roads with proper equipment; we must  enforce the covenants to preserve the quality of our visual life; we  want to continue to send welcome packets to newcomers; our neighbor- hood directory is very important for communication among us, and we  want the Spring Fling to continue to be our annual get together on  Memorial Day for all neighbors •  •••.• Continued on Page 2 .....  - ,  •  '  I  1  o  .  -------------------------------------------M---------------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS  SHHA/Sandia Peak Tram Co .••• 1-3  SHHA Board of Directors •••.••.• 9  Cinco de Mayo Home Tour ...•..• 3  SHHA Calendar •.•••••..••• 11 & 12  Water Rate Intervention ....• 4-5  BCFD #5 •..•...•.•..•...•• 13 & 16  Non-Fire Emergencies ..• _ ..••... 5  Hospitality .•.....•.•..•... 14-15  Neighborhood Coffees .•.••••.•• 5  _!?RIT Information ..••.••.••..•• 17  View from Jack Rabbit Hill •. 6-7 Classified Ads .........• 17,18,19  ----------------------------------------------------------------- - / - Since SHHA is all volunteers with no office nor secretarial staff, SHHA  has been PAYING the Tram Co. to provide some of these services for  us for several years. Your dues provide these funds. That is why your  covenant letters (usually 20 a month) come from Cleve Matthews of  the Tram Co. and say he is writing on behalf of SHHA. That is why  the monthly covenant monitoring trips are conducted by Cleve. That is  why newcomers pick up their packets telling about SH at the Tram Co.  building. The snow plowing is an expensive service we contract for  with the Tram Co.  It's not ideal and leads to some confusion but contracting with the  Tram Co. seems the best way to provide services to our members. At  the present time, we have no office, no staff and lack the means to  provide them. Alvarado has been providing many of these services free  for years. They have the home owners list on computers. They have  the office, staff and telephones.  Garbage collection, security guard, and Four Seasons are services pro- vided by various companies and are totally independent of SHHA. If  you need service in these areas, please call the Tram Company. For  water service, call the Sandia Peak Utility Company. Fire protection,  of course, is provided by the Bernaillo County Fire District 115. Animal  control is wholly a county matter.  SHHA members are fortunate to have such a cooperative development  company backing us for these many years. Mos•t of the Tram Co. peo- ple live or have lived in SH. They have acted in a caring way and  gone the extra mile.  Now there is no new land to sell. Their office complex will stay here  but, after twenty some years, the Tram Company is going to withdraw  from providing free services to SH. Your SHHA Board is working long  hours trying to decide which transitions are necessary and how they  may be made gracefully, efficiently and economically. The Transition  Committee is a subcommittee of the Long Range Planning Committee.  Members of both are meeting with Tram people who are also devoting  some of their time to negotiate these transition decisions.  Occasionally, we find ourselves on the opposite sides of issues such as  the water rate increase. The SHHA Board is an elected body that  represents home owners. More than fifty members came to a meeting  called to decide whether or not there was member interest in formal  intervention. That is the largest number of home owners that have  ever come to any SHHA meeting in recent memory (including the  annual meeting and election of board members that this year will be  Saturday morning, June 4th.) The Board responded accordingly.  SHHA has commited large sums of your dues to hire professional, legal  help in conducting a responsible intervention with the New Mexico  Public Service Commission. Regardless of the results, this will be a  clearing of the air. We can move forward with a dear understanding  of the financial needs and policies of the water company and the  assurance that we have a "fair deal."  ••••. Continued on Page -:r ·-· .....

Also planned is a  preview party on Sunday,· May 1st,  at the  home of  Mr. and Mrs.  Don Franterhouse.  The  preview  party,  which  has a limited amount of tickets  available, will begin at 6:00 PM.  In  addition to  admiring this  beautiful adobe  home, the guest will  also enjoy  a varied menu  of hors d'oeuvres and wines.  Entertainment will . continue until  the conclusion of the party at 9:00 PM.  Thursday, May  5th (of  course>, the home tour will begin at  10:00 AM at the Sandia Peak Tram parking lot.  At each  house the  guest  will  sample  a  variety of food prepared by the Symphony  Guild volunteers.  Busses,  complete  with  guides,  will begin  their continuous  round trip,  delivering guests to the featured  homes and returning them to the parking lot at the  completion of  the tour.  The busses will run continuously from 10 AM to 3 PM.  Tickets for  the Preview  Party are $20.00 per person.  Home  Tour  tickets are  $7.00  in  advance  and  $8.00 at  the door.

If you have not  made a  commitment, we  urge you  to  do  so.  Our  success will be greatly enhanced through your  contributions and moral support.  Recently you have received a  letter  from  the  Sandia Peak  Utility  Company  which  obviously  is in opposition to the Home- owners Association intervention procedure.  They  have indicated  that our  mailing wa.s  "misleading and  unfair".  We do not share  this viewpoint.  We are truly sorry that  their interpretation of  our  correspondence  has  left  them with this impression, for it  was not our intent.  In addition, their letter has set forth a  series of "facts"  and has requested your support in opposition to the intervention.  The  Homeowners  Association  agrees  that the real issue at  f-1and is in fact long term,  quality, reliable  water servicg_,_ an.Q.  we would  add to be delivered efficiently and at a fair cost by a  ~.ell-managed company.  After  r-eading  and  cat-efully considering  the intent of their recent letter we hope that you still conclude  that you are not  being "misled"  by your  Homeowners Association  and that you support intervention.  If,  however-,  you  are supportive  of  the Utility Company  assertions in total and  favor- non-intervention,  it is requested  that  you  notify  your  Homeowners  Association  or Intervention  Committee of that support.  We  want to consider the viewpoints  of all  our constituents.  It  should be  noted that  as of this  date we have received  absolutely no  correspondence opposing the  intervention action  that we  have taken on behalf of the commun- ity, with the exception  of  the  recent  letter  by  the Utility  Company.  Please advise us if you feel differently.  We also  wish to report that  our request for a continuance  to prepare our case for this  intervention has  been granted and  that a  new hearing  date has been set forth:  April 12, 1988, 10  AM, New Mexico  Public  Ser-vice  Commission~  224  Palace Avenue,  Santa Fe.  Please  confirm this hearing date to make sure it has  not been rescheduled if you plan to attend.  It should be noted that any inter-ested person  may appear at  the  hearing  and  make  a  written  and  oral  statement without  becoming an intervenor.  If you are supportive  of this interven- tion,  we  would  like to  have  you  consider directing written  comments to the commission  in advance  of the  hearing, and that  you  would  plan  to attend  the  meeting  to show your support.  Additional details r-egarding this procedure can  be furnished by  your  intervention  committee if  required.

The granite sand in  Sandia Heights is actively trying to Join the  20,000 feet  or so  of similar  sediments at  the bottom of the Rio Grande Valley and  we residents are trying to prevent just that.  People with long experience  in  the area  vigorously guard  the  vegetation  on  their  land from destruction by construction  crews.  Newcomers may  not  have  known  that  drastic  action is  necessary to  protect our fragile vegetation, if only for erosion  control, and found the plants destroyed on their  land.  Left to  nature, it's probable that  the first thing that will come up on  that  bare granite  sand  are  tumbleweeds  or  similar vigorous  WEEDS.  Not pretty, we cry, and want to cut them out.  But think  of the sandstorms tumbleweeds  have prevented,  and think  of the  shade  they  provide  for  some  more  desirable plants,  and be  patient.  A number of people suggest Just cutting the tumbleweeds  to  one  foot  or  less for  use as "nursery" plants and erosion  control until more favored plants can  be established.  And that  takes time  in the  high desert,  with temperatures from -9 to 99  degrees during the year, variations of 30 to 40 degrees  from day  to night,  and weeks  of less than 10% humidity.  It takes a very  well-adapted, patient  and opportunistic  plant to  make it here.  But  there are  thousands  of  excellent flowering plants in New  Mexico that were here before we were, many of which  are or could  be adapted to our gardens.  Many  more  types  of  plants are needed in this ecological  system than in some other places; some plants grow and  flower in  spring  then  disappear  completely,  some  do  their  living and  flowering in the summer heat, and some come  in the fall.  After  the initial  comeback,  consider  selective  weeding  while  you  establish your  plants.  To  me,  some  local  plants are more  desirable in  the garden  than others.  Thistles don't please me  because they take over the place  and are  very difficult  to get  rid of  once they  are established.  Goathead is a pretty little  ground cover and is admirable until  you step  on its well armed  seed and  limp for a day.  Some plants such as gum weed shade out  the grasses I try to encourage so I remove them.  Most of the  ••••• The View from Jack Rabbit Hill continued an Page  I/  ,,  ---------------------------------------------------------------- THE VIEW FROM JACK RABBIT HILL, continued •••••  others  I  let  come  ahead  until I consider that they interfere  with some plants I want more, then I  often Just cut the ''weeds"  back to provide more  ground shade during our arid months and to  conserve moisture for  the plants  I  favor,  either planted by  Mother Nature or by myself.  Native plants are available  now in  the many  of the nurs- eries, and some nurseries are native specialists.  Many residents  plant the natives  with  great  success,  but others have some  misconceptions about "native gardens".  Some  gardeners consider  that the natives must live here so they think that they can Just  be planted and forgotten.  First, they were started with  CARE in  the  nursery  and  they  take  time  and  more CARE to establish.  Second, they may not be native to areas with conditions the same  as Sandia Heights and  won't respond  well unless  and effort is  made to approximate their home requirements,  but they are often  more  tolerant  and  drought-resistant  than  many of the classic  nursery plants.  The reward _from  studying  the  requirements of  the native plants comes  when they  have established their roots  and settle down to life in Sandia Heights with you  and you don't  have to stand over  them with  a hose for the rest of your life.  And, in the west  where  water  is gold,  that's worth thinking  about.  • •• Jean Heflin •••  ------------------------------------~--------------------------- ~  .,~  Transplant Trees  1'o.a..Q'  &  ..... \\.~\."

Your 'own  District  5  is equally affected and is woefully  short of adequate personnel to fully respond to  daytime emergen- cies.  If  you  are  18  years  of  age  or over and can of fer your  services, please visit the  Fire Station  located at  11700 Paseo  del Norte.  Talk  with our professional there, Mike Hand, and if  you are suitably  impressed  and  if  you  can  pass  muster, an  application will  be handed to you for completion.  Bring it back  to the Station and it will  be  considered  by  the Department's  Membership Board.  Please give  this some  serious thouqht  men and women are  eligible, and we need competent volunteers.  Surprisingly the present complement  of District  5 has more  members who  live outside  the confines  of Sandia Heights.  This  is perhaps a sad reflection of  our residents'  community spirit.  Think about it!  Supposing you had a fire and nobody came?  Speaking of  fires!!!  The good weather is fast approaching  burning time is in the minds of many gardeners  - those tumble- weeds  must  go.  The  operative  word  is "tumbleweeds", not a  general bonfire of your accumulated trash.  ~,  An ordinance  is in  effect which  prohibits such violations  and these  days tickets are issued as warnings.  Repeat offenders  are subJeci to fines being levied.  You may have a  BURN,  but first  you  MUST  call  the non- emergency number  at District 5 - 293-4275, or, if no answer, the  Fire Marshal's Office - 843-7822.  State your  name and address  and ask  if burning  is permitted  that day  and the hours during  which it may be carried out.  Your  cooperation  in  adhering  to this  will  be  greatly  appreciated.
