THE GRIT - E X T R A  February 1988  INTERVENTION!  The Sandia  Heights Utility Corporation proposed water rate increase  and the justifications presented  in their  January 5,  1988 meeting were  not well  received by  an overwhelming  majority of  homeowners present at  that meeting.  At the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association  meeting on  January 6,  1988  these  same  homeowners,  without  a single dissent, petitioned your  Homeowners Association to intervene on their  behalf against  the proposed  rate increase,  citing  a  multitude  of  reasons.  In addition they have  requested SHHA to allocate the  necessary  funds  to  conduct  a competent  intervention,  utilizing expert  legal  and  technical  professionals to  analyze the pending  rate case  for  the  purpose  of  showing  cause for  rejection or mitigation of the proposed rate structure.  Your SHHA has reacted on an immediate basis to this petition.  WHY IS INTERVENTION IN THE RATE CASE NECESSARY?  The Sandia  Peak Utility Company is an inve~tor-owned utility, and as  such, is entitled to  a  fair rate of  return  on  investment  for water  services.  The investors are the  Sandia Peak  Tram Company, Sandia Peak  Ski Company and Al~arado Realty Company and their principals.  Since the last rate increase granted in 1981 utilizing the test year  of  1979,  revenues  have  grown  from $104,992 with expenses of 5104,437,  gallons pumped 74,692,564 and 612 customers to the test year  of 1986 with  revenues of $413,311 with expenses of $416,690, gallons pumped 162,094,000  and customers totaled 1243 at year end 1986.  The  Utility Company claims  that in  spite of  this dramatic  growth and  a 89/. rate increase in 1981,  that an additional $134,266  in revenues  to a  total of  $584,920 will be  required to  insure an  adequate rate  of return  of 8.45% as adjusted for  the year  1986.  The Company  further stated that from  the inception of  their last  89%  rate  increase  in  1981, that with the exception of one  year, the water company has operated at a  loss, and  that their stockhol- ders have  in essence  been subsidizing through this time period the water  company, which henceforth is expected  to operate as  a  separate entity  receiving an adequate rate of return on investment.  It should  be  noted  from  the financial data set forth above, that  should their proposed  rate . increase  be  accepted  as  submitted  to the  regulatory commission,  that the cost per  gallon of water delivered will  have increased 1231. from 1979----1986 in spite of  significantly increased  customer participation and water usage demand.  In addition  the Utility  Company has indicated, through their expert  witness and company officials, that the requested increase is ''modest and  that it is not  good rate  making practice to make radical shifts in rate  design.''  In other  words, as costs increase as projected,  further rate  increases to maintain an acceptable rate of r~turn should be anticipated.  Page 2  Although  significant differences exist  in  the cost of delivering  water services between  the  City of  Albuquerque  and  the Sandia Peak  Utility Company,  a utilization of water bills for the test year of 1986  and the incorporation of the proposed rate increase for an  average useage  of 8229  gallons indicates that our  water company billing would be 198%  higher.  Fo~ those customers utilizing  over 9000  gallons the percentage  would be significantly increased.  It should also be  1986 involving additional  quences of  the 1987  tax  this proposed rate case.  noted that events occuring since the test year  revenues and costs,  as well  as the tax conse- reform act will of necessity not be included in  It is through an analysis of  this data,  coupled  with information  provided through  the Homeowners  meetings, that  we hope you have come to  the conclusion that intervention and a complete audit  of the Sandia Peak  Utility  Co~pany operations is in  order,  and  that you are willing to  provide the necessary financial support to carry this project forward.  Your Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association in anticipation of your  total support,  has on  January 13, 1988 approved the homeowners' petition  for intervention as submitted and voted for action by the  Board on behalf  of the entire commuAity as well as a number of individual intervenors.  An intervention  committee was  established consisting  of both board  members and individual intervenors to carry  forward this endeavor.  This  project has received initial funding by the SHHA Board.  The Law Firm of Hatch, Butler,  Motions to intervene  have  been  Homeowners Association and a number  by the Public Service Commission.  ·~  Allen and Shepherd has been retained.  filed  by  Mr.  Hatch on behalf of the  of individual intervenors as required  Over the near term the issues  involved are  being examined.  These  issues include, but are not limited to, the magnitude of the rate increase  as it relates to cost items  and rate base, subcontracting relationships  between the water company and affiliate enterprises, possible conflict of  interest relationships, electrical usages, quality of service, etc.  Obviously the success of this intervention is extremely important to  each of us individually and as a community.  It is through  our concerted  efforts as  a group  and our  representation by the Homeowners Association  that we will be able to influence ~ith any degree of success both proposed  and future rate and service changes.  It is important  that  we  set the proper community ''tone" for the  myriad of services that are provided on a  continual basis  by entities of  the Sandia Peak Tram Company.  Due to the expense of providing this ''tone" and the expert interven- tion required for this water case, additional· funding  over ~nd above the  SHHA  Board  allocations will  be  necessary  to carry this project to a  successful conclu~ion.  Page 3  For this reason we  would appreciate  a vote of confidence  and ~our  support through  a voluntary contribution on an immediate basis of $30.00  per member/family to establish  a legal  and accounting  escrow to support  the  intervention action.  It is anticipated that this funding action  should be completed by 19 February 1988.  These contributed  funds will be  commited after we have exhausted all SHHA allocated funds in the interven- tion procedure.  In the event that it is not necessary to utilize your contributions,  all  funds  will  be  refunded  to the extent not utilized.  Again, your  financial support is critically needed at this time.  Remember, in the absence of a  successfully funded  intervention, the  proposed rate increase  by  the Utility  Company could add a minimum of  $134,266 per year to the community water bill.  In  addition, the Utility  Company could  be left with the concept that we will be easy to deal with  in regard to future service rate increases.
