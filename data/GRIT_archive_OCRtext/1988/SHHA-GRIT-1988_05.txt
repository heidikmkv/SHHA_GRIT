The purpose  of the  meeting was  stated to be to decide an  agreed upoM course in response  to  the  Sandia  Pueblo  claim of  9,840 acres  on the  west face  of the  Sandia Mountains; to form  committees in order to divide the  work; to initiate a petition  to inform  Albuquerque area residents and gain their support; and  to respond to the letter from the governor of the pueblo.  Anita  Miller,  the  attorney representing  SHHA  and other  landowners reported the legal situation:  1>  The  Dept.  of  Agriculture  people  in  Washington  and  lawyers who have examined the claim  on behalf  of homeowners, do  not see  any legitimacy to the claim.  The Secretary of Interior,  as of  this date,  has not  received a  final recommendation from  his Solicitor  General.  The latter will issue a legal opinion as  to the validity of the Sandia  Pueblo claim  before the Secretary  will act one way or the other.  2>  fhe Secretary of Agriculture has requested the Attorney  General, Office of Land Claims make  a legal  determination as to  whether the  Secy. of  Interior has .the authority to corrrect a  patent.  It is not clear  that the  Secy. has  the authority to  correct a  patent when  there is strong disagreement from another  department of.government <Dept.  of Agriculture>  and in  view of  two  federal  laws  requiring  acts  of  the  U. S. Congress when  changing Indian lands in New Mexico and wilderness areas.  3>  It is not clear what steps would be  taken if  the Secy.  chooses  to correct  the  patent.  We know of no precedent case  involving, for instance, Wilderness  Areas and  private property.  The  Secy.  of  Agriculture  <the  department in which the Forest  Service reside5) has stated its intention  to request arbitration  should Interior correct the patent.  In the  opinion of  the SHHA legal committee, the effects on  the open  space,  Wilderness  Area  and  recreational  areas seem  clear; the general public and the private land owners would have  no say in the future disposition nor use  of the  land, including  its lease or sale.  AssLtrances such  as a  1 etter stating  the Pueblo's "intent"  have no legal status and are not, for  example, supportable  in a  court of  law.  It is the opinion  of the  legal committee that  only an act of the US Congress could  assure that  the land would  remain open  space, that  public access  would be preserved, that  homeowners would have access to their  property, that  the Pueblo  would not  assess property  owners and businesses as they are now  assessing businesses  on  Pueblo  land,  that  water  and mineral  rights, county  services would  be preserved, and that recreation  areas would  remain available to the  public at  no charge, etc.  This is because only  Congress has full legal authority over the  Sandi.a Pueblo •  •.. Sandia Mountain Coalition, continued on Paged_  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Sandia Mountain Coalitions, continued ...•.  Ms. Miller reported that it is her opinion  that concerned  citizens should raise all these issues now, before the Secretary  of Interior acts~  It will  become  increasingly difficult and  expensive to affect the outcome once a decision has been made.  4)  Ms. Miller  presented a  brief history of the situation  and listed the opportunities the Pueblo  had to assert its claim  but instead,  said nothing  or cooperated with efforts that wciuld  seem contrary to their present position.  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo recognized  the.Spanish land  grants  in  1846.  In  1864, Lincoln signed a patent supposedly  based on the 1748 treaty boundaries and then  disputes arose over  the land  so in  1891 the Court of Private Land Claims was estab- 1 ished to resolve these remaining land questions.  Then, in 1906 Theodore Roosevelt included  the west  face of  the Sandias  in  the  Manzano  Forest Reserve.  In 1921 the west  face w~~ incorporated  into  the  Sandia  Game  Refuge-. In 1924,  because  there  were  additional  Pueblo  land claims, the Pueblo  Land Board was created by Congress  to investigate  these claims.  In  1946  the  Indian  Claims  Commission  was created to resolve  Indian land claims against the Federal  Government.  In 1978 the  present Wilderness Area was created by Congress.  When  the  Tramway  as built  and  on  later occasions when  Sandia  Heights  was  growing,  the  Sandia  Pueblo  entered tnto  detailed  negotiations  with  the  Sandia  Peak  Tram Company and  Alvarado Realty.  Those  agreements  and  leases are  in effect  today.  ON NONE  OF THESE OCCASIONS DID THE SANDIA PUEBLO ASSERT  A CLAIM TO THE LAND THEY ARE NOW CLAIMING.  Vi Miller of the city open  space task  force reported that  she was  very concerned that their group learned of the threat to  the west side of the Sandia Mountains only recently.  Volunteers to serve on a Legal Committee were  requested.  A  unanimous  motion  authorized  this  committee  to consider  and  secure legal assistance for  the coalition.  Committee members  are  Shannon  Gurbaxani,  Linda  Zemke,  Bob Heiser, Fred Galley,  Anita Miller and A. J. Ferrara.  A Petition Committee was formed,  headed  by  Ed  Taylor, of  "Save Our Sandias".  Petition·:; .:.:n-e to be mailed to:  P.O. Box 14353, Albuquerque 87191  Helen Steck will also accept petitions  She may be reached at 299-2313  A Political  Committee was formed to pubiicize and lobby for  the coalition positions.  Art Gardenswartz  is chairman  and Ned  Miller, George  Franklin, Jim  Bishop and Vi Miller comprise this  committee.  Erik Carlson moved and  it was  passed unanimously  that the  coaltion work diligently to emphasize the issue of chief concern:  the preservation of the  open spaces  for all  present and future  citizens, Indian  and Non-Indian, and that Forest Servite manage- ment be continued; and  that  the coalition  make  every effort,  including  asking  for  more  fine articles in the newspapers, to  inform the public of the threat to their recreational lands.  -3- THE VIEW FROM JACK RABBIT HILL  EARLY BLOOMEF:S  Just now  a variety  of wild flowers  are appearing  like magic  in what looked  like dead sand all winter long.  Usually the first to  ~ppear is a little  annual  introduced  from  Europe,  the  cranesbill  or  filaree.  You  can tell  it's a geranium from  a close examination  of  its  1/4"  deep red pink flowers. The  Spanish called it alfilarillo  (from it~ needle-like seed pods,  no doubt>.  As children we pretended that the pods were miniature  swords or made scissors of  the crossed  pods  by  inserting one  into the other.  The filaree appears everywhere, grows like mad  for a  while, and  if left alone and  given no  extra water will  eventually shrivel  up and  disa~~ear in the summer heat, like so  many other of  the earliest spring  flowers,  aptly called the  ephemerals.  Two  happy  plants  of  the spring  are  the bladderpods and the  spectacle pods.  They are both mustards, more  showy relatives of  the common  tansy mustard  which is also blooming just now.  The  mustards  are easily  picked  out  because  of  their  cruciform  flowers, with  their four  petals in the shape of a cross +.  The  bladderpods come in both perennial and annual varieties  and make  a  show  of  bright  yellow  mounds  ~long our roads and arroyos.  Spectacle pods are tallet-,  sometimes up  to- 18"  high  ~..,ith heads  of small  white flowers.  The  names tell  the story about their  seed pods which march up the stems as the season passes.  My favorite among the early flowers  is the  perennial stemless  eveing  primrose.  Sometimes  driving  along  you will see what  appears to be white  paper thrown  along the  road, but  oh happy  day, this  time it is not  old Dixie  cups, it is the graceful,  al most tt-ansparent 2"  ~'1hi te blooms that l .::i.ter fade  to pink.  It  thrives  in  sand  and  gravel  where many other plants refuse to  live.  Arriving in our garden on its own volition  and receiveing  a bit  of extra water, the plants bloomed almost all summer.  I'm  hoping they did not exhaust  themselves  with all  that blooming  and will  come again  this year,  or perhaps it self-sowed enough  seeds so that it will reappear.  A  number of  its relatives are  delightful in  the garden, Oenothera coronobifolia and 0. species  have smaller but more  numerous  flowers  and  the  non-native 0.  missouriensis is  a  mound  of  bright yellow cup flowers during  summer.

NM 87122  - 1l- Dear Sandia Heights Neighborhood Members:  SUBJECT:  Neighborhood  Appearance,  Neighborhood  Teamwork and  Covenant Control  The purpose of this letter is to provide  information and  an introduction  the the  Unit Covenant  Control volunteer's job,  philosophy, and intentions.  It  ~s the responsibility of  the  whole  Sandia  Heights  neighborhood and  its members  to control and improve the quality  of our neighborhood. This requires eac:h of us to do  our part to  add  to the quality  of  the  neighborhood and to work with our  neighbors in a teamwork atmsophere rather than adding controversy  and disharmony  to the  neighborhood.  It requires all of us to  exercise our individualistic choices within the  framework of the  community and  unit covenants  which we all received as a part of  the package and privilege of living in the Sandia Heights area.  Since there are over 1400 family  units in  the area  and 29  different sets of covenants, no single person can control all of  the  items  that  are  involved  in  the  neighborhood covenants.  Therefore, the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association is develop- ing the  concept  of  a  unit  covenant  control  volunteer which  should help  in implementing  the covenants  and building harmony  in our  neighborhood.  Again, it should be  emphasized that the  unit  covenant  control  volunteer  cannot  do everything and the  .L  whole neighborhood teamwork concept depends on  neighbors working  out difference with neighbors.  - J 1-- The  unit  covenant  control  volunteers  will  serve in the  capacity of observing covenant control violations  and helping to  resolve differences  so that individuals can do the modifications  they desire within  the  covenants.  These  volunteers  will be  available  and  will  be  meeting  you  to  understand our mutual  problems.  Thanks for your cooperation and support.

BOX 1293  ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO 87103  ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT  March 11, 1988  Dear Sandia Heights Resident:  A pl ague infected rodent has been found in Sandi a Heights South.  Because of this, a few simple precautions should be taken by all  Sandi a Heights residents to avoid the possibility of contracting  plague.  Dead or sick rodents should not be handled.  If you find  dead rodents. do not handle them, but report them to the Pl ague  Survei 11 ance Sec ti on at 768-2600 so that they may be collected and  tested.  Plague infection in rodents generally results in a die off  of the rodent population. thus creating increased risk of human  infection from the bites of rodent fleas which have lost thier  norma 1 host.  Dogs and cats should be dusted with an appropri ati ly  labeled flea powder regularly and should not be allowed to roam free.  Plague is a treatable disease. and human symptoms include a high.  fever, general weakness. and a painful lump or swelling in the groin  area. under the arms or in the neck.  A person with these symptoms  may or may. not have plague, but it would be important for them to  check  promptly with  their doctor.  Failure to receive prompt  diagnosis and treatment can result in a much more serious form of  the disease or even death.  The  Albuquerque  Envi ronmenta 1  Heal th  Department  is  conducting  investigations to determine the extent of the infection and will  apply insecticides to control infected flea populations.

As  usual I  have more  projects going  for Sandia  Heights than I can handle,  so this is my  annual plea for help  for the  programs.  I need  someone  who  is interested  in  helping  me  continue  the park  upgrade program.  We have  been  alloted  a  sum  to  improve the  playground, so  the major battle is over.  The plan is to build a  safer, yet attractive area for  our  children  to enjoy during  outdoor activities at the  park.  I also  need a person who can  act as a liaison to the Forest Service.  Floyd  Thompson of USFS  has  indicated  that  his  department  is interested  in a joint  trails development  with  Sandia  Heights.  This  could involve  building  new  trails,  connecting  some of the existing systems,  and using Carsonite type trail  markers  and  legends  similar to  those used  by the Parks Service.  I also need someone interested  in maintaining  some aTtistic  fot- the park.  the current trails system,  perhaps someone with  ability to  complete the half-built trails legend  I have had numerous  requests ·'for  some sort  of organized  running and  walking event  for the area, maybe  a 10 K run/walk  complete with  T-shirts  and  awards.  As  usual  my persuasive  carisma has  procured the  blessing and promise of money from the  Homeowners Association, so all I need is the talent and  time of  some interested few.  PLEASE call me if you are interested.  Nm..Y, 1 et' s  get SERIOUS.  Many  of you knm..Y that there have  been  numerous  accidents  and  incidents  involving  joggers and  walkers  on  and  around. the  Tramway  area.  I won't recall the  unpleasant details,  but suffice it .to  say, that  they were all  unnecessary.  As  careful  as  most of us are, there are always  some  crazies out  there  trying  to  circumvent  our  caution.  Tramway  is a  major  thoroughfare that has been assigned county  road status by our  progressive county  government, so relief is  still at  least 6  years, and  3 bond issues away.  To be fair to  the motorist, it is sometimes unnerving  to pass  a heavy trailer  travelling in  the opposite direction and  try to clear a jogger  on the right side of the road.  One of the main  reasons that  we developed  the trails into  the residential  area  and  national  forest  was  to provide an  alternative to Tramway.  Unfortunately, even  staying off Tramway  will not ensure total safety, so please use some common sense.  -Run opposite traffic if possible  -Stay well off the road, especially Tramway, if possible  -Women are especially vunerable, and sould be extra cautious  at or after dusk  -If you must run after dark,  wea~ reflective clothing  -Run with a friend (single file near traffic, please>  -Don't try to outrun that Transam at a crossing  I know that this list is the  same  one  that  I  use  on my  3-year-old,  but  I  can't  stand  to read about my friend in the  paper, so please forgive  my parent-child  approach, and  live to  enjoy this summer.
