The board  consists to  business men  and women who are executives or  business directors,  lawyers,  an  airline pilot,  realtor,  and retired  business and  military men and women.  They bring a combined experience of  over 500 years in successful careers.  SHHA  is extraordinarily fortunate  to have this pool of talent.  In addition,  the associate board members (that serve on committees)  bring additional talents and years of  experience to  SHHA,  all donated  free  to  you  and  me.  If  you  know a board member or associate board  member, pat him or her on the .back!  Current issues are:  --two lawsuits,  unfortunatley against  our own:  covenant violators  in Sandia  Heights South.  David  Sullivan heads  the legal committee and  Roger Hoppe heads Covenant Control.  --tracking and planning action  should it become  necessary  in the  Sandia Pueblo  land claim against some Sandia Heights land.  Legal commit- tee member Anita Miller, a  leading  land  use  attorney,  spearheads this  effort.  --selecting and  meeting with  a negotiating committee with responsi- bility to meet with representatives of  Alvarado  Realty  and  the Sandia  Peak Tram  Company.  This group  will bring back to the board recommenda- tions  on  the division  of  responsibilities for  running  this growing  neighborhood in  the years to come.  Vice  President Leonard DeLue heads  this committee.  --researching the administration of  the water  company and assessing  the merit  for the requested rate hike of 29%.

Albuquerque. NM 87122  11 I  I- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  The following  items in general relate to recent hearings held by the  Board of County Commissioners, the County  Planning Commission  and the NM  State Highway  & Transportation  Department and are felt to be of interest  to residents of Sandia Heights.  The information  concerning North Albuq.  Acres comes  about as  a result  of our  appointment by the County Commis- sioners to an Advisory Board on the development of North Albuq. Acres.  Following  the  reversal  of  an  earlier ruling  that  the proposed  project  put  forward  by  Tierra  West  Development Management, agent for  Quailwood, be changed from 6  units to  8  units  <the  latter  being the  original request>  this change was formally requested under SC5-87-57.  At  the same hearing a request for CRM-87-8 to close a  portion of  San Rafael  Avenue adjacent  to the project, Tract  B, Sandia Heights South, Unit 16,  was also made.  Both items were approved subject to conditions.  It may be of  interest to note that  at this  hearing a  Special Use  Permit for  a Planned Development of 80 units, to be known as the Enclave,  located west of State Highway 14 North,  was  denied.  This  was  on the  basis of too many units per acre, <approximately 5>, and that the communal  waste water  septic  system  was  unacceptable  inasmuch  as it  would be  harmful to the water wells of existing properties.  Another developer was  denied a permit on similar grounds  for a  project nearby.  Conditions on  the east side 6f the Sandias relative to strata formations are distinctly  different from the west  side  of  the  Sandias  and  the  County Planning  Commission  maintains  a  close  watch  on  all  such building requests to  ensure there will be no infringements of basic  health regulations brought  about by contamination.  .~  A little closer  to  home  in  North  Albuquerque  Acres there is a  possibility of a contamination problem arising  if the  Albuquerque Public  School Board  seeks to force the  issue and includes a septic tank in its  plans for the new school to be built  in this area.  A school  with 1000  students  plus Staff  surely  needs  better sanitation when one considers  there will be an estimated 40,000  gallons per  day discharge.  APS Board  in its infinite wisdom  regards protests  by NAA residents as unwarranted  interference and takes an altogether high-handed attitude toward homeowner  protests.  This is unpardonable and  the APS  Board should heed existing  ordinances and consider what  viable alternatives are available.  As and  when the  school is built, many of its pupils will be from Sandia Heights  and it behoves our residents  to  be  aware  of  what  transpires  in this  matter.  A recent  presentation and  up-date on  Paseo del  Norte was given by  members of the State  Highway  & Transportation  Department.  You will  observe  from  the  attached  adgenda  that all phases of the project were  discussed relative to the actual development  process.  In addition there  were  technical  presentations  on  the project  need,  alternatives, and  preferred alternates, followed by an environmental analyses.  Paseo del Norte will be  a  6-lane,  limited  access,  major arterial  highway.  There is already a  planned route,  plus an  alternative.  The  access roads as  presently  shown  take  some  rather  odd  routes  and in  general  do  not  necessarily follow straightforward East/West alignments.  All right-of-way has not yet been  acquired, funding  is tight,  and there  is a  reluctance to initiate condemnation proceedings or invoke the right  of eminent domain.  There is still a  great deal  of opposition  from som~  developers and  individual landowners  in certain areas.  Although this is  a cut-and-dried project, implementation is stil1 far from  start-up time .  • • • . • Conti nue•j on Page 5  .....  --·,  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMUNITY AFFAIRS <continued)  The traffic  count from I-25 to Wyoming is 40,~JO CPD, and from Wyoming to  Tramway Blvd. is 10,000 CPD.  It was recognized with the completion of the  road, the traffic flow  from Wyoming to Tramway Blvd. would increase.  By  the same token, the flow from Tramway Blvd. in a  westerly direction would  also increase  considerably.  We made the point that work on Tramway Blvd.  should be started in the very near future.  There  appears to  have been a  change-of-heart refunding  for this  and both  the City of Albuquerque and  the State Highway Department may now each play a considerably  more active  role and not leave the burden of construction costs entirely to Bernalillo  County as was originally planned.  As a matter of information, the old District 5 Fire Station is again  operational.  Engine 52  is now stationed there with the object of giving  a faster response to fire and other emergencies occurring in  North Sandia  Heights and  Sandia Heights.  Full back-up will be available as necessary  by units from our Main Fire Station located on Paseo del Norte .  •.• Bill Jackson - Community Affairs - SHHA (294-3063> •••  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PROBLEM OF CRIME IN SANDIA HEIGHTS  At  the  11  November  1987  SHHA  meeting,  the guest speakers were  Sheriff Alvin Campbell  and  his  Community  Relations  Deputy,  Bill Lee.  Their presentation related to the serious problem of crime and what we as  property owners could expect  in the  way of  services from  the Sheriff's  Department and our own Sandia Heights Security Department.  Both  of  these  Departments  have  provided  excellent services  in  support of  Sandia Heights  Homeowners.  It should,  however, be realized  that budgetary  restric~ions, size and scope of the service areas somewhat  limits total effectiveness of their programs.  In  other words,  they may  not  be  in  the vicinity  of  a  crime without being notified that it is  occurring.  Sandia Heights at the present time does not have a  "formal neighbor- hood  watch  program."  Present  crime statistics for this area. indicate  that this type of  progran, in  some form,  is definitely needed and your  participation is essential.  Deputy  Bill  Lee presented SHHA with his  card which had a  statement  printed that  sums  up  the entire message:  "Help yourself by helping your neighbor."  The SHHA,  as well as your next door neighbor, would greatly appreci- ate your involvement in notifying the  Sandia Heights Security Department  and/or  the Sheriff's Office if  you  witness a crime or believe that a  larceny,  burgl~ry, or assault are  imminent.  This report  could  also be  extended to  prolonged cruising  of your  neighborhood by suspicious vehi- cles, or the sounding of a burglar alarm at a  neighbor's home.  A simple  report will greatly assist the Security Department in preventing crime.  SHHA  would  also appreciate  any  comments  that  you might have in  regard to the necessity  of producing  a more  formal "neighborhood watch  program."  Please contact a Board  Member if  you are interested in this  program.  Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in this matter •  . . .

GABALDON  12700 San Ralael,-NE  Suite6C  Agent  Tramway at San Rafael  - Albuquerque. NM B.7122  ,, '  ;:Oandia Heights  Resident  THE VIEW FROM JACK RABBIT HILL  From my  window, I  can see  the double  black dots  of the ears of a  mammoth Jack rabbit bouncing up and  down above the grasses  and I  ~ender  whether he  or I  will be first ta enjoy the plants I set out last fall in  the front of the house.  Very early  in the  morning the coyotes went by  outside the  fence discussing  the hunt  in their high pitched barks.  The  scaled quail don•t seem to mind  that only the bare  bones of  the winter  garden are left and cross inside the fence to our feeder.  What a fascina- ting place we live in.  In some other part  of the country, winter is a  time to pour over  seed catalogues  and plan  spring annuals.  In Sandia Heights, we do this  only on a small scale.  Most of us here don't want to spend  the amount of  time and  w~ter necessary to grow  many of the standard annuals.  We came  here because it was  "natural," but,  greedy humans  that we  are, many of  want our  flowers too.  Winter here is a good time to think about what we  mean by a "native" or natural garden and how that  wi 11 affect  \'Jhat to do  in the spring.  We  can  start  by  looking  more  carefully at all those little grey  plants around us that know so  well how  to live  in our  extreme climate.  Sandia Heights  has an  abundance of  beautiful flowering pl~nts that come  in succession with the seasons that  we can  encourage around  our homes.  The high  desert ecology is one  of the most active and diverse anywhere.  Each of those little grey plants fills a  niche:  spring plants  come up,  then die  quickly and disappear in the summer heat.  Summer rains bring on  the grasses  and a  different group  of wildflowers.  The  cooler days of  fall bring  the flowering of rabbit brush and aster, and new bloom of some  of the established plants.  In cold winters, parts of the garden  can look  like a moonscape and yet with the first warm days, it is full of seedlings  coming up.  Plants here are canny; the change of temperature  and moisture levels  each year  influence which  flowers you will see in profusion.  One year a  patch of ground will be covered  with gumweed,  another year  mostly sweet  clover, another year chocolate flower.  Wildflower seeds are very particu- lar about the conditions  under  which  they  will  sprout  and  with each  year's dofferent condition you will find a different mix of flowers.  To get  to know  which plant  is which in your area include Flowerino  Plants of New Mexico by Robert DeWitt Ivey  and Spring  Wildflowers of New  Mexico  by  William  C.  Martin  and  Charles  R.  Hutchins in your winter  reading.  Then in  the spring  as all  those little grey plants start to  come up,  you can  choose your friends.  After all, they know an awful lot  about living in Sandia Heights .  ••.

Specifically, property owners who are graced  with fire hydrants adjacent  to  their  properties  have  built walls,  planted trees, moved rocks, or  inadvertantly buried portions of the  hydrants.  The  Ordinance is very  specific that  there shall  be a  minimum of 3 foot clear space around the  circumference of  the fire  hydrants,  except  as  otherwise  required or  approved by  the chief.  The chief also indicated that the base plate upon  which the hydrant is bolted should  be exposed.  The  Ordinance is quoted  below:  Section  10.206.  No  person shall  place or keep any post, fence,  vehicle, growth, trash, storage or any  other material  near any fire  hydrant, fire  department connection or fire protection control valve  that would prevent such equipment or  hydrant from  being immediately  discernable or  in any  other manner deter or hinder the fire depart- ment from gaining immedi~te access to said equipment  or hydrant. A  minimu~-~ foot clear space shall be maintained around the circumfer- ence of the fire hydrant •..  I am sure that as a  property owner  you would  have bad  feelings if  your house  or your  neighbor's house was inadvertantly damaged by fire as  a result  of the Fire Department's inability to  have total  access to a  hydrant  and  its water  content,  which  you  had in some way allowed to  remain obstructed.  In addition to possible legal complications, insurance  ratings on  all homeowners  could be modified according to the Fire Chief,  if it was shown  that  the  hydrants  in  Sandia  Heights  were  not being  properly  maintained.  Lastly,  you  are continually  in violation of a  County Ordinance for whict-1 you can be cited and subject to legal action.  The Sandia  Heights Homeowners  Association~ the  Tramway Company and  the Fire  Chief all  request your  cooperation in following this Ordinance  to the letter.  If the  hydrant is adjacent to  your property  on County  right-of-way, it  would be  greatly appreciated  if you would individually  take whatever action is necessary to comply with  the County  Ordinance as  soon as  possible.  Please contact the Fire Chief at 293-4275 or your SHHA  representative for Roads and Safety,  Ed  Bates at  299-2155,  if further  information is required.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter .  • • • SHHA Board •••  SANDIA HEIGHTS OPERA GROUP  Coming up  on Saturday,  February 27,  will be Gilbert and Sullivan's  "Trial by Jury"  and  a  premiere  of  James  Gallm.,iay's  "Pastoral".
