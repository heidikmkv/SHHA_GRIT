No sooner then they resolve one issue, two more chal- lenges surface. To wit, here is a list of the issues the Board Of Directors are ‘grappling with:  + Cedar Hill Park, there are members of the SHHA Board who want more done with the park.  ‘+ Streamlined Covenants, a committee has been working on changing the Covenants so that they are easier to manage and enforce.  + Commercial development, ther is @ possibility that we will be faced with the prospect of additional commercial property along Tramway Blvd.  + Walls on the lot line, several property owners would like to erect walls around their property on their property lines.  + Some residents are trying to establish grass lawns. Is this wise during prolonged drought? Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez is proposing a regional Water Control Board, which would include Sandia Heights. ‘Throw that in the mix with the City/County Unification and we could see all kinds of changes in Sandia Heights,  ‘There are probably some other issues, which I have not listed However, as you can see, your SHHA Board of Directors has their hands full. We ‘wouldn't want it any other way.

Some dealers will simply offer to replace your toramp cooler with an air conditioner, adding a single retum duct. It’s not that ‘simple as swamp coolers and air condi- tioners operat athe diferent.  A swamp cooler merely blows  air into your bouse through existing ducts, and it ‘must exit through open windows or doors to be effective. They don't work with 2 sealed house. ‘A recirculating ai conditioner requires return duct to exhaust air from the house, cool and fl- terit, and return it tothe house. For an air condi- tioner to work propery, the return duct(s) must be located to create air low throughout the house, 50 the returns must be located far distant from the coo! air supply to get proper cooling flow.  Ar conditioners usually supply mach cooler air than swamp coolers when they are op- crated inthe cooling mode. That means that the ducts supplying cool air often “sweat”, meaning. ‘that they are cold enough for water to condense ‘om their outside and drip water down from them ‘onto your ceiling or into your walls. You must rip pans under the ducts or thoroughly inslate them to prevent such drippage or you willbe in deep trouble, You will gt lots of mold.  Ifyou have a house with two swamp coolers, you are usually beter off by installing ‘one high capacity ir conditioner at one of them, and using the other asthe return duct system. Use the one with the easiest insulated ducts a the supply, asthe return ducts don't need insulating  Generally, ifyou have a question about ‘onversion, you can give me a call at 828-3938 and I can give you an opinion based on 38 years ‘of experience in installing industrial equipment. ‘My advice is free and could help you to avoid some severe mistakes  ‘The Grit  ‘August/September 2003  Ieeeraeroneneentnen tent  nar-z2icn we abenndeeTe 4 6F WIE ONE #6  as] teu 2 BF ete yo aaboabnary  WN ‘3nowsnONEeTy = ‘sub Lae roy souccouon agen mPa  ‘ava aovisoa'sn i “dls Ga1NOS3Nd JAS iss  ‘The Grit ‘August/September 2003
