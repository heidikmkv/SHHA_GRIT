  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                      May 2004        SHHA ANNUAL MEETING  SCHEDULED FOR   JUNE 5, 2004    The annual meeting of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association will be held on  Saturday June 5, 2004 starting at 10:00am  at the Church of the Good Shepherd.     Outgoing Officers and Committee Heads  will present brief reports and answer  questions. Members of the SHHA will  elect new board members. Nominations  from the floor are not permitted. Officers  pre-elected for the coming year will also  be introduced.  SHHA members are  encouraged to come to the annual meeting  and participate in the business to be  conducted.  Refreshments will be served   at the conclusion of the meeting.    During the past year the SHHA  established new bylaws, and created new  committee charters.  These are available  on our website for anyone interested. We  believe the new bylaws and charters will  simplify governance of SHHA by making  responsibilities more clear.    At the 2003 SHHA annual meeting, the  members were given a preview of the  plans for Cedar Hill Park.  On April 24th,  2004, we received notification from the  Bernalillo County Commissioner that  construction of the park had been  approved. The Park will be named for  W.L. Jackson, one of Sandia Heights’ first  residents and a major contributor to  developing this area. The Park was  dedicated on May 1st at 10:00 AM, with  Commissioner Tim Cummins in  attendance (see article on page 2).    During the past year we also had several  meetings on the City/County Unification  effort.  The move to unify the city and  county appears to be stymied at this time  since the voters of Bernalillo County  defeated the proposed unification plan.    New Business to be discussed at the 2004  annual meeting includes a proposed  unified set of covenants. This unified set  of covenants would help facilitate  administration and enforcement, as it  would replace all the separate and  different Unit covenants. To be adopted,  this change of the covenants requires a  75% approval by the property owners of  each individual Unit, a difficult task that  we will be pursuing during the upcoming  year.    If you are not currently a member of  SHHA you may apply for membership at  our office during May and attend. We  believe we have made significant  improvements in how SHHA operates and  in the benefits we provide to our residents.  This has been demonstrated by our  increase in the number of residents who  are members and in the increased  attendance at our various activities. It’s  our community and your involvement  helps make it better.  Page 2  Groundbreaking Ceremony  Held for W.L. Jackson Park  By: Bob Francis    Over 100 people attended the  groundbreaking ceremony for the W.L.  Jackson Park at Tramway and Cedar Hill.    County Commissioner Tim Cummins led  the ceremony honoring W.L. Jackson.  Also in attendance were Robert Nordhaus,  Louis Abruzzo, State Rep. Ron Godbey,  and members of the W.L. Jackson Family.    W.L. Jackson worked for what is now the  Sandia Peak Ski & Tram Company for  four decades. He was one of Sandia  Heights first residents.  Jackson started the  Sandia Heights Volunteer Fire  Department which became a part of the  Bernalillo County Fire District. Naming  the park in honor of Mr. Jackson is a  tribute to his memory and his dedication  to the Sandia Heights Community.    The Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association contributed $19,000 for  development of the park. Several SHHA  present and past board members were also  at the ceremony. When finished, the park  will be an enjoyable place for kids and  neighbors to relax and play right here in  the Heights.    Special thanks are in order to Bob  Christman, the SHHA Coordinator who  has been shepherding this project for the  past several years.      Wine Tasting A Success!  By: Mona Lee Schilling    The annual SHHA Wine Tasting was once  again a big success. Held at Futures for  Children, over 150 neighbors enjoyed the  beautiful weather from the outdoor patio.  It was obvious that those attending  enjoyed socializing with neighbors, plus  meeting new ones, while sampling the  various wines and delicious appetizers.    The silent auction, in its second year, was  quite successful with a unique variety of  items donated, all of which sold. Proceeds  of over $900 will be donated to Futures  for Children.    Many thanks must be given for the kind  generosity of all those contributing to the  success and enjoyment of this event.     First, Futures for Children for allowing  SHHA the use of their wonderful  facilities; Tom Donelley of National  Distributing Co. for the tables of wine and  beer; Lena Martinez and Sheraz Saint-Lôt  for working the check in desk; the  members of SHHA who graciously  supplied the appetizers and the nice  people who donated items for the auction.    Appreciation is also given to Chuck  McLeod, Heinz Schmitt, Larry Greher,  and Mona Lee Schilling of the  Community Service and Membership  Committee who worked to organize the  event.

The steep downhill pitch and  blind curves make speeding particularly dangerous for pedestrians, especially children who walk  to bus stops or to the playground at Little Cloud Park.   It is the only route in and out of Sandia  Heights for many pedestrians, and the lack of a sidewalk means that drivers must share the  roadway and respect the rights of people (especially children) to safely walk and bicycle in their  own neighborhood.    Residents waited for several years for the county to test and approve speed humps that were  specifically designed for the 15 mph speed limit on their street.  The design was finally approved  last year, and a new petition was submitted and slowly made its way through Bernalillo County's  administrative process.  To show its encouragement, the SHHA board passed a resolution asking  the county to install speed humps in all neighborhoods where the residents want them.  Even  with support at all levels, these safety features were vetoed by the Bernalillo County Fire  Department for reasons that have not been completely articulated.       The Fire Department also specified that humps would not be allowed further east on Tramway  Lane, where another neighborhood effort to control speeding was in progress.  This followed the  Fire Department's recent veto of sorely needed speed humps on the western part of San Rafael,  which were unanimously desired by residents of that segment of roadway.    We invited Bernalillo County Fire Marshal Kent Hendrickson to speak at our May board meeting  and/or to our annual SHHA meeting in June.  We extended these invitations to give him an  opportunity to explain the reasoning behind his rejection of our speed humps, and to find out if  he will work with us to find a mutually satisfactory solution to this safety problem that plagues  our neighborhoods.  Mr. Hendrickson declined our invitations for unspecified reasons.  We have  now invited him to our July board meeting.  If he accepts, we will announce the time and place  in the next GRIT.      Little Cloud Park    We have been informed by the County Parks & Recreation Department that the broken swing set  at Little Cloud Park is in the process of being replaced.  The new equipment is expected by the  end of May.

Page 7  Commentary    The Way It Is of the Week    Winning for Everyone by not Trying to Win    We all filter what we "see" happening through a lens or standard.  Only when our lens or standard becomes absolute, unconditional love for all, have  we stopped trying to "win" in competition with other people.  And it is only then that  we are truly winning - aware of all that has ever happened, accepting it all, and  feeling only absolute, unconditional love for everyone.
