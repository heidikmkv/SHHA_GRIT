  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association             June - July 2004    President’s Report  By Bob Francis    As President of the SHHA for the past two years, I can tell you that it has been a challenging and  interesting experience.  I spent a great deal of time with lawyers, and in the courtrooms,  enforcing the covenants of Sandia Heights.  I also spent many hours on Saturdays attending the  County Unification Hearings.  The County Unification proposal eventually failed because too  many special interests wanted a piece of the pie.  These efforts and the time the Board has spent  on them are a necessary part of maintaining the quality of neighborhood life in the Sandia  Heights.    During the past year your SHHA Board of Directors accomplished several projects that make us  a better association.  We established new by-laws and new committee charters.  The committee  charters are designed to provide committee members with a clear sense of purpose.    In the past year we also started orientation sessions for new board members.  The orientation  provides new BOD members with a broad view of legal implications of the association, and the  duties of the board members.  This will create a smoother transition process between retiring and  new board members.     Sandia Heights is a wonderful place to live.  Ninety nine percent of the residents respect the  covenants and their neighbors.  We can all enjoy living in Sandia Heights if we continue to work  together as a community.  We are now in the transition period with new association officers and  new board members.    New SHHA Officers and Board Members    The SHHA Annual Meeting was held June 5th and the following Officers and Board Members  were elected:    New Board Members  Re-elected Board Members   New Officers       Victoria Smidt     Mark Boslough      Ralph Rudolph - President  Rick Fairbanks    Frank Soper        Larry Greher - Vice President  William McCall    Larry Desonier      Vacant - Secretary  Thomas Coyne              Cheryl Iverson - Treasurer  Anton Salem  Kenneth Hook  Marsha Thole  The GRIT    Page 2  Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association  State of Condition  as of May 31, 2004      ASSETS      Cash          Checking    $42,460.00  CD    $32,716.19  Petty Cash    $16.93  Total Cash    $75,193.12        Other Assets  Office furniture/equip at  cost    $12,923.43  Prepaid Postage    $678.61  Prepaid Rent    $991.10  Security Deposits    $1,075.75  Total Other Assets    $15,668.89        Total Assets    $90,862.01  Liabilities - None        CASH FLOW 6/1/03 THROUGH 5/31/04          INFLOW          Advertising    $26,125.52  Fees, ACC reviews    $3,703.00  Interest Earned    $1,326.10  Membership Dues    $143,439.38  Wine Tasting    $3,393.00  Misc., refunds, etc.    $560.55  Total Inflow    $178,547.55    OUTFLOW    Donations    $1,100.00  Dues    $620.00  Insurance    $17,323.78  Committee Expenses    $701.24  Communications    $19,614.01  Annual Meeting Cost    $308.52  Halloween Party Cost    $559.79  Town Hall Meeting     $130.56  Wine Tasting    $1,050.74  Legal    $23,236.14  Office, Including Rent    $25,875.11  Office Staff    $35,770.56  Sandia Services,  Collection Fee    $13,008.00  Taxes, IRS    $462.74  Taxes, NM Gross  Receipts     $1,361.84  Total Outflow    $141,123.03  TOTAL INFLOW LESS OUTFLOW  $37,424.52            SHHA Annual Meeting   Treasurer’s Statement   June 5, 2004  Cheryl Iverson, Treasurer    I’d like to thank the  membership for their  support this past year.   It has been a good  year for our  Association.  We’ve  made great strides in  strengthening our financial position.    For the past 12 months total receipts were  $178,547.55 and disbursements were  $141,123.03.  All committees were within  budget and this was accomplished by hard  work by the Board members and with  increased activities by all committees.   We  saw increases of 33% in ACC reviews funds  and a profit of over $2300 from our Wine  Tasting function.  Our publications are  completely self-sufficient and brought in a  profit of over $6500.   However, on the  downside we saw our insurance costs  increase by 17% and this was after a great  deal of searching among vendors.  We were  able to find new insurance with a much  better rating then we previously had.  Our  office lease did increase this year as  previously agreed.  Office staff costs were  up, as well.  However, we have an excellent  staff and I would encourage you to stop in  and meet Lena and Sheraz.    Our accounts were audited early in the year  and we were found to be in good standing.  I  would encourage anyone in Sandia Heights  who has an interest to consider being part of  the Finance Committee.  We are always  looking for new membership.    Thank you for your support and I look  forward to being your Treasurer this year.  The GRIT                                                                     Page 3  Traffic, Safety and  Environmental   By Mark Boslough    Open Invitation to Kent  Hendrickson:    As Chair of the Traffic  and Safety Committee, I have attempted to contact Fire  Marshal Kent Hendrickson for several months.  In his position  as a public official, he vetoed several speed hump projects that  were strongly supported by our community and had already  gone through the extensive county approval process.  The  residents of Tramway Lane between San Bernardino and Lynx  Loop have been waiting since 1998 to get speeding under  control in their neighborhood.  Residents of San Rafael were  unanimous in their support of speed humps on their street.    I invited Mr. Hendrickson to our May board meeting to see if  he could help us deal in some other way with our public safety  problem, but he declined. I invited him to explain his position  to residents at our annual meeting on June 5, but his assistant  said he was not available.  I have left several messages inviting  him to our July meeting, but as of The Grit deadline I still have  not heard back from Mr. Hendrickson.    Please, Mr. Hendrickson, we have a serious speeding problem  on our streets and we need your help.  Please come to our July  meeting and work with us to find a solution that is acceptable  to everyone.    Moving On    This is my last issue as Editor of The GRIT and last week  working for the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association.  It  has been an excellent time and I enjoyed every day (well  almost every day) working with board members, homeowners,  and co-workers.  I sincerely appreciate the opportunity and  generosity of the association by allowing me to work part time  while in school at UNM.  I met so many nice people here and  got a lot of good advice from those who’ve already done it all.   When the time comes for home ownership I’ll definitely know  what I’m doing!

At the heart of the design of each of the Unit  Covenants is a term that has meaning  beyond what is found in the dictionary.   “Harmony” is defined by the ACC  Procedures and Guidelines as:  o The overriding intent of all covenants is to  preserve the open and uncluttered natural  features of the area as a whole.  o Uniformity of design and construction is  not a goal in and of itself, though a general  uniformity may result.  o Harmony requires the preservation of open  spaces wherever possible.  o Harmony envisions structures that blend  into the background. Generally, that which  is structurally harmonious is that which  tends to blend into the natural features,  mimicking the colors and shapes of the  natural features.  o A harmonious project is one that visually  preserves the skyline, the mountains, the  desert, the wildlife, an unobstructed view  of the sky (minimal light pollution), and  the openness of properties.  o Reflective roofing materials are  inconsistent with the natural background  of the area.  o Excessive light pollution is inconsistent  with the concept of harmony and is  prohibited.  o Harmony causes there to be limits on the  construction of full two-story structures.    All ACC decisions derive from the  covenants.  The committee’s procedures and  guidelines flow from the basic tenet of the  covenants – Harmony.  Committee members  make decisions based upon the harmonious  nature of a planned construction and how  that construction blends into and preserves  the environment.      The most important concepts as stated in our  covenants are those that define Harmony.   What is important is that we continuously  strive to maintain the ideal as it was set out  in our covenants.    The ACC Procedures and Guidelines are  available on the SHHA Website.  Any  owner who is contemplating a construction  project can read these guidelines and will  have a good understanding of how the ACC  will analyze his or her project.  Each  member of the committee stands ready to  assist an owner in developing plans.      Neighborhood Announcements     Extended SHHA office hours!

Bernalillo County Parks Department  provided a 20 cubic yard dumpster at the  jobsite.  There was a tremendous amount of  concrete and black top dumped on the  property during the last 20 years.  Since  most of it was dumped near Cedar Hill  Road, it is not part of the contractor’s scope  in building the park, as that area is a  protected easement for water flow.      We had a great turnout from the  neighborhood and the entire weekend was  spent digging, breaking up concrete with  sledgehammers and loading the dumpsters.    By Sunday afternoon, the 20 cubic yard  dumpster was full.  The county appreciated  this effort due to the cost savings and the  community involvement that showed how  much Sandia Heights wants this park.    Construction of the park will start in the next  week or two.  Sandia Services already has a  backhoe digging on the property to connect  the new water line for landscaping uses.  We  would like to thank the volunteers who spent  the weekend cleaning up the park property.   Future status will be provided in The GRIT.   SHHA members are welcome to stop by the  office to view plans of the park.    Communications & Publications   By Ralph Rudolph    We are doing things rather differently this  year, as the job of editing the three  publications been turned over to the office  staff, and the printing is being done outside  rather than in house.  Improved revenues  from advertising have permitted this.  The  advantage is that this allows for greater  continuity and quality.  The website continues to be maintained up  to date by our Webmaster and remains a  useful tool for our residents.  It has added  sections for Board Motions, Board  Procedures and will soon contain all  Standing Committee Charters.  The  Architectural Control Committee has also  added some useful guidelines to help  residents understand restrictions better.    Suggestions on further improvements are  always welcome.     Community Service & Membership   By Chuck McLeod    The committee has been busy this year.  We  planned a summer games event but it never  got off the ground.  We provided food and  drinks for the December Board  Meeting/Christmas Party.  Our committee  hosted and provided finger food and  refreshments for the first community Town  Hall Meeting, which was well attended.    We had our annual wine tasting which was a  success.  Starting this year we held the wine  tasting event as a fundraiser for Futures for  Children.  We donated $1,000.00 to Futures  for Children from this year’s event.    We are still wrestling with membership.   Our goal is that all Sandia Heights Residents  would be members of the Association.   Some may think it’s a lofty goal.  The  committee feels that membership should be  mandatory.  We are planning another event  for August – September time frame.  Watch  The GRIT for details.  The GRIT                                                                                                                            Page 11  Special Liaison Committee Report  By Don Wortman    This committee was formed a few months ago by Bob Francis  to deal with the commercial development just north of the  Philips 66 Station.  Tricor Southwest, with headquarters in  Scottsdale, had acquired that property from Eye Associates.   Then they sold the northern half of that property to Matt  Musgrave and George Burnell and that is where the  Albuquerque Kwik Lube is now being constructed.  The  current status of this development is:    1. Eckerd Building – As a result of strong action by SHHA officers and Board Members we  have been successful in getting those three triangular cupolas removed.  We have also  been told that the building will be painted one uniform southwest type color similar to the  store that Tricor is constructing at Tramway and Candelaria.  One of the workmen on the  sight told us that Ace Hardware is interested in the store but we have not been able to  confirm that.  In the meantime, Tricor is stuck with at least five buildings in various  stages of construction with at least two that we know of being completed – the one here  and the one at Academy and Seagull.    2. Albuquerque Kwik Lube – From the beginning we have had a constructive dialogue with  George Burnell about the Kwik Lube building.  The final building will have a number of  southwest style elements although there is a limit to how much you can do to an auto  garage.  Matt Musgrave and George Burnell plan to add a five-unit retail building just  south of the Kwik Lube building.  They hope to have a restaurant in two of those units,  and CURVES for Women has signed up for another.  Most of our neighbors would love  to see a “Starbucks” there and we have advised George Burnell of this.    3. Other efforts – This Committee has taken the leadership in discussions with  Commissioner Cummins on the possible application of an “overlay” plan to any further  commercial development along Tramway in our neighborhood.  Such an “overlay” plan  would assure neighborhood involvement in the development of properties along  Tramway.  There are three commercial properties left undeveloped along Tramway.   Beginning at the north end, Futures for Children owns the empty land just south of their  headquarters.  It is zoned C-1.  They currently have no plans for development.  Across  the street, there is an empty lot just north of the Circle K.  It is owned by the Outpost and  they have had off and on plans for expansion for years.  With Commissioner Cummins  help we plan to keep an eye on this property.  The third commercially zoned property is  located at the northeast corner of Tramway and San Rafael.  For this property the SHHA  covenants do apply so we are more assured of influence in the development of that  property.                                  PRESORTED STD.  U.S. POSTAGE  PAID  PERMIT #375  ALBUQUERQUE, NM    Sandia Heights Homeowners Associa- tion  2-B San Rafael, NE  Albuquerque, NM 87122              Back O’ The GRIT Tech Section - Town Hall Meeting Forum  By Dick Brackett    Two years ago Jim Cook presented the BOD with a creative idea.  He offered us the challenge to  develop an internet based forum which would be always open and available – a plan where every  owner in Sandia Heights could meet with every other owner, almost at any time he or she chose  to do so… a place of discussion and debate where the hot and not-so-hot issues of the day could  be sorted out.  Before he could develop this idea, Jim went back to law school and resigned from  the BOD.    The idea has come up periodically during the last two years, but no one has been willing to  sponsor its pursuit.  During this past year, I have gathered three others including Jim Cook who  are interested in taking up this project.  We now have an Internet Forum in place and are in the  process of establishing formats, topics of discussion, Internet protocol, Web oversight, and other  management procedures.  The next step is to get beta-test participants to begin using the forum in  order to expand its purpose and use.    I would like to invite all residents to participate in this test project to help determine if there is  enough interest to fully implement the forum.  To do this, simply provide your email address to  the SHHA office so that you can be invited to participate in the forum once it is ready.  With  your help we can move this creative idea to the next level of development.  After a testing period  the SHHA BOD will determine whether or not to fully implement the forum.
