  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                    December 2004      HAPPY   HOLIDAYS!      President’s Message:   By Ralph Rudolph    The Holiday Season is upon us, so the Board would like to invite you to attend our Holiday  Party on December 8th at 7 PM at the Sheriff Sibrava Substation, just off NE corner of Eubank  and Paseo del Norte. Come and share some refreshments and snacks and meet the Board members  to express appreciation for what they do for all of us. We wish all of you a great holiday spent with  good friends and cheer.    We’ve recently had a few Board members resign for family or business reasons (or moving out of  Sandia Heights) and are looking for more members. If interested, please let a Board member or the  Office know of your interest. Our Vice President, Larry Greher, recently resigned and we urgently  need to replace him.     Lena Martinez, our friendly and capable office staffer will be operated on in December and will be  out for at least a month. Please send her your best wishes and try to make life easy for Sheraz, who  will be handling the whole office work load as well as getting the new Directory ready for  printing/mailing.    Years ago Sandia Heights had signs at entrances to subdivisions. Some of the signs became  weathered and they were mistakenly taken down. SHHA would like to replace some of them with a  longer lasting material. The size of the signs will vary depending on location. The Board decided to  hold a contest like they did for the park artwork. The design and motto of the sign should reflect the  Sandia Heights experience. The contest will end in April. So all you creative people out there, get  your pencils working and submit your entry to the SHHA office.        Announcements & Notices:     SHHA Board Meeting – December 8th at 7pm at the William Sibrava Substation.   Office Hours: 9am to 3pm, Monday through Friday.   The office will be closed for Christmas from Friday, December 24 through Monday,  January 3.   Notary public services are free to members only. Please call to make an appointment.   A black and white photo of a female was found on Live Oak and Tramway. If you have  lost it please come by the SHHA office.

Many children in a splendid assortment  of costumes attended to enjoy the wonderfully entertaining  clown, apple bobbing, squirt the candle, pumpkin toss, dress  up race, wrap the mummy and more games. To see all the fun  that was had by many, go to our website to check out all the  photographs.     Coreen Garcia donated goodie bags filled with stuffed  animals for each child; Michelle Sirota, Laura Criel, and Amy  Thompson shopped and baked tasty goodies for the party;  Jennifer Donaldson manned the refreshment stand: Wendy  Ohls set up Halloween luminaria; Mona Lee Shilling dunked  kids in the apple bob tubs; Bob Francis glided around the  room wrapped by the kids as a mummy; Debbie Otiz, Sheraz  Saint-Lot, and teenagers Robb Foxx, Shaina Saint-Lot, and  Trae Iafeta helped the smaller children throw bean bags and  pin the nose on the pumpkin: Todd Criel kept the older  children active squirting the candles with squirt guns; Vicki  Criel and the teenage helpers scared the older children with a  story as they felt the "inner guts"; and the Paseo Station fire  Dept delivered goodies. It was a fun, safe celebration for all!    PARKS AND NEW DEVELOPMENT  W. L. Jackson Park - Bob Christman     The play equipment is complete and installed. It looks great and the colors are what we requested.  The native grass and wild flowers are germinating on all the dirt banks. This will look beautiful  in the spring in addition to the Lizard artwork, which is scheduled to be installed in April 2005.  The turf is getting established and has been cut twice so far. No problems have been noted after  several inspections. The steep turf hill is a winter sledding hill for kids and is getting a lot of  compliments from everyone who visits the park. Most people under the age of 20 who cannot  resist rolling down the hill. The park is getting a lot of daily use with birthday parties, picnicking  on the grass, kite flying, dogs running after balls, and children playing games on the grass.  Walkers, joggers, bike riders and dog walkers use the dirt paths. Stop by to enjoy your new park.    SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY – John Pickering     With the holidays fast approaching, here are a couple of tips from Sandia Heights Security.  If you display your tree in a window, don’t put your presents under the tree where they can be easily  seen from the road. This is an open invitation for a thief.      When you return home from holiday shopping, pull your car into the garage and close the garage  door, if possible, before unloading your gifts from the trunk. If it is not possible to pull your car into  the garage, take a look around before you unload the vehicle.     Never leave holiday gifts in the trunk or back of your vehicle outside overnight. If someone will go  to the trouble to steal your stereo, they will surely go to the trouble of taking goodies out of the trunk  or back of your vehicle.  Most thieves are opportunistic; you can save yourself a lot of trouble by  cutting down on their opportunities. Remember crooks holiday shop too!   Have a safe and happy Holiday Season.  The GRIT                                                                                                                            Page 4  UNIFIED COVENANTS STATUS REPORT  -Frank Soper  Chairman, Covenant Support Committee     During the summer the proposed model of the Unified Covenants (UCs) was reviewed by  an outside land use attorney. His recommendations were then evaluated and included where  applicable.     On November 3rd the SHHA Board met to provide the Covenant Review Committee (CRC)  with questions and suggestions about specific items. The CRC will make the necessary  changes and the revised UCs will again be presented to the Board for final review and  acceptance.     In early 2005 the UCs will be posted on the SHHA website for the benefit of Sandia  Heights residents. Also, a group representing a good cross section of property owners who  volunteered will be asked to critique the model UCs.     The CRC members have done preliminary work regarding the residents outreach phase of  this project. The CRC will develop a specific action plan and put it in operation in January.  We anticipate that at least two months will be needed to accomplish this effort. If any  resident has experience in marketing or promotion and would be willing to assist the CRC  with organizing our outreach program, please call the SHHA office (797-7793) or Frank  Soper (856-5560). We sure need your guidance!    PHOTO CONTEST Thank you to those of you who submitted your  beautiful photos. We were most happy to receive 30 submissions! After  careful deliberation, we will select a winner whose photo will be featured  on the cover of the 2005 Directory. We hope to have the directory finished  and published by mid January and mailed out by the end of January.    The 1st ArtsView@Sandia Heights was held on  October 24th, a wonderful sunny fall day. Many of the  Sandia Heights residents enjoyed visiting seven  artists’ homes in the afternoon.  This was a wonderful  community-building event, which is planned to be  repeated on an annual basis. The organizing  committee extends the community’s gratitude to the artists who exhibited their artwork in  this event and welcomed the art lovers in our community to their homes and studios. Visitors  enjoyed the hospitality of the artists and appreciated their eagerness to provide information  about their artwork. The exhibiting artists were: Don DeGasperi, Lynda Burch, Stanley  Schmidt, Linda Manion, Terry Lee Heller, R. Peter Buttner, and Ralph Rudolph.    The 2nd Arts View will be October 16th 2005. The organizing committee is starting to collect  information from the interested artists. Please contact Rudy Rudolph if you are interested in  participating:  Address:  1044 Red Oaks Lp.

COMMUNITY SERVICE & MEMBERSHIP  COMMITTEE  Criel's Spiel by Vicki Criel     I am one of those people who attended a meeting to  "express my concerns", and left as the new chairperson of  this committee.☺  Many people see the SHHA primarily as  an organization responsible for enforcing policies and  covenants. I think it is also important to have a fun reason to  join the homeowners' association.     We will be meeting as a committee on a monthly basis to  plan fun and educational activities for our members. We are  planning additional art shows, music under the stars (jazz,  etc), wit and wine nights (speakers), cleanup and grill with  neighbor weekends, game day at the park, discounts for  members, etc. We would love your ideas! Please email me at  vcriel@comcast.net or call me at 615-3333 with suggestions  or concerns. Also, call if you'd like to get involved.

Click on THE A.C.C. then on Architectural Control Committee  Project Log. As you probably know, an application and plans for all new construction, additions,  remodels and other exterior changes to your property must be submitted to and approved by the  ACC before the start of work. This includes walls and fencing, outbuildings, landscaping, pools,  re-roofing, re-stuccoing, driveway paving/repaving, air conditioning and solar panels, etc.  The  ACC works very hard to review every application and monitor every project in ways that assure  that covenant restrictions are applied fairly to all projects so as to preserve the special character  of Sandia Heights. The Project Log is a good place to start when you have a question about a  project in your neighborhood, as it lists every project currently under management by the ACC.   Projects are listed in numerical order by street address.  For each project there is a brief  description, its current status, and the name of the ACC member assigned.  If you have concerns  or would simply like to know more, please feel free to contact the designated ACC member. We  hope that you will find the ACC Project Log useful.
