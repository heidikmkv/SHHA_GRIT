Board Directors Needed  By: Heinz Schmitt, Richard Frederiksen, Chuck McLeod – Nominations Committee    Board President Bob Francis has appointed a nominations committee to provide candidates to  replace retiring Directors of Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. New Directors will be  elected at the Annual Meeting on Saturday June 5, 2004. We need you to replace retirees.  Why?  To improve the community of Sandia Heights.  To get to know your neighbors more.  To be part of designing the future of our “mature” community.  To give back in a way that preserves what you enjoy about living here.  Board members are elected for 3-year terms, serve on at least one and possibly two of the seven  standing committees and attend monthly meetings of the Board. Generally it is believed that it  takes about four to six hours a week of your time. In order to keep the Sandia Heights we all  enjoy and love, being a member of the Board is a very necessary, and rewarding job. We need  representation from all of the units on the Board and we urge you to consider taking this  opportunity to become a board member. Sandia Heights is essentially a mature Homeowners  Association with new bylaws approved last year. Consequently, we will be moving into a new  phase of our existence. The next few years will be an exciting opportunity for you to help plan  the future of our association. Please review the ivory center section of the 2004 Directory of  Residents, which lists the duties of the committees and other functions of the Board. If you are  prepared to serve as a Director, we urge you to contact the SHHA office at 797-7793 or any of  the Nominations Committee members and submit a short resume reflecting your experience and  interest in working on the Board of Directors.               Don’t forget to fill out your SHHA Wine Tasting  Reservation form on the other side!      Page 2  THE OBNOXIOUS ECKERD BUILDING  By: Don Wortman, Chair – Special Liaison Committee    You might assume that the company constructing a new building along Tramway in Sandia  Heights would want to have the goodwill of the neighborhood before it opened, right? You might  assume they would have shared their plans with SHHA, right? You might assume that Bernalillo  County zoning and building officials would encourage developers and builders to consult with  their neighbors when they are going to build in a residential neighborhood, right?  Wrong on all  counts. Neither Eckerds, the occupant of the building, or Tricore Southwest, the owner of the  building, nor for that matter the County, care about what we in Sandia Heights think.     According to the Albuquerque Journal article on Feb. 27th, Eckerds is building 8 stores in the  metropolitan area. (Shades of the confusion we all had about FURR’S, this article states  “…J.C.Penny…is negotiating to sell its troubled Eckerd drugstore chain…”) It appears that  Eckerds will use the same “cookie cutter” design whether the building is in the middle of a  commercial area like at Seagull and Academy or in the middle of a residential neighborhood like  ours.     Given that the area Eckerds is building on is zoned for commercial development and given that  we in Sandia Heights have been shown no consideration, SHHA is focusing on having the three  triangular structures (the builder, JAYNES, calls them cupolas) that rise above the roof removed.  The President of SHHA has sent letters to both Eckerds and Tricore with this request. We also  met with county zoning and building officials on Feb. 26th. Commissioner Cummins has become  involved and even though he may not be able to help us on this cupolas issue, he has asked  county officials to advise him about further development at this site.     Because of a zoning variance sign posted on the property just north of Eckerds, we have learned  that Albuquerque Kwik Lube will be constructing a building at that site. Their request for a  zoning variance concerns the size of the sign on the front of the building facing Tramway. We  will oppose this zoning variance at the public hearing scheduled for March 9th and request that  the plans for this building be reviewed with SHHA. It appears that the traffic to and from the  Kwik Lube will have to pass in front of Eckerds. I’m not sure that makes any sense.     I think the only way to “wake up” Eckerds is to boycott their business. The only question in my  mind is whether or not we as a community can be sufficiently disciplined to make that effective.

Traffic Safety & Environment News  By: Mark Boslough, Chair – Traffic & Safety Committee    New Stop Signs  At our request, the county has converted four of our intersections into multi-way stops.  These  corners all have limited visibility, with insufficient line-of-sight for drivers to see oncoming  traffic at the speeds people have been driving.  Please be extra observant of the new stop signs at  the following intersections:  ¾ Tramway Lane & Deer Drive  ¾ Bobcat Blvd. & Deer Drive  ¾ Honeysuckle Drive & San Rafael Ave.  ¾ Eagle Ridge Road & Eagle Ridge Lane    Please contact SHHA if you are aware of other intersections you think could be made safer with  additional stop signs.    San Rafael Speed Humps Vetoed by Fire Department  The residents of lower San Rafael Ave. failed in their attempt to get speed humps despite their  unanimous agreement and county data showing high rates of speeding that meet the criteria for  such control devices.  In the final stage of the approval process, the Bernalillo County Fire  Department determined, based on emergency response concerns, that speed humps should not be  installed on this roadway.  We are looking into ways of getting this decision reversed.    Page 6  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  (The comments and opinions expressed do not necessarily represent the views of the SHHA)    Use the Pedestrian Paths on Tramway  To the mom and dad who complained about the speeding white SUV in the last GRIT:  I am definitely for safe driving and speed control on our overgrown and curvy Sandia Heights  roads.  But for the life of me, I do not understand the thought process that would take three  "training wheeled" children out on these roads and risk their lives to prove a point.  We have  miles of beautiful paved and wide safe bike paths at the bottom of all our entrances and exits  from Sandia Heights.  These roads we live on are not wide enough and not cleared enough to  allow cars and people at the same time.  It would be a different story if we had paths or  walkways carved out of our roads and if we did not have the Tramway bike/walker path.  I as  a mom and grandmother never allowed my children and now my grandchildren the opportunity  to get in harm’s way.  I can’t speak for those who choose to walk these roads.  Even at 15 mph it  takes just a few moments to get to the base of the Heights, park, and enjoy the bike/walker paths  without risking not only the children's lives but the driver's too.    -K Belle Conway, Resident    Are Speed Humps Effective?  Regarding Mark Boslough's letter: There never should have been a vehicle behind you when you  were walking. When you walk on a road that has no sidewalks you walk against traffic so you  can see vehicles coming at you. As for speed humps: we do not need them, they do nothing. Go  to Live Oak Road, where there are speed humps and see that people slow down for them and  accelerate immediately after, even on the uphill.   I have lived here for seven years and there has never been an accident. We do not need  something that is ineffective and annoying.   -Carl Gutman, Resident    A Shift in Perspective for all Holding or Seeking Public Office  What if all persons currently occupying positions of influence and power, especially those  persons seeking to occupy positions of greater influence and power, were to:    1. Examine their motivations for desiring influence and power and determine what they plan  to do to improve the plight of all creatures on the Earth.    2. If after examining their motivations for desiring influence and power, they found those  motivations to be self-centered, they chose to quiet their minds and allow appropriate  motivations to free them from the prison of the limited and limiting restrictions of the  ego; and, transport them from the dimension of politicians to the dimension of leadership.    I wonder what the nature of the relationships between people, all over the world, would be if this  What If became reality?  -Robert Gardiner, Resident            Page 7                                PRESORTED STD.
