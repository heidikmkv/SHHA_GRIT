He retired from the U.S. Air Force  and Los Alamos National Lab and moved to Sandia Heights in  1991. Don is a member of the American Association of  Aviation Artists. Many of his paintings have appeared in  aviation  maga- zines and  juried  shows.  Don also  designs  and  builds  electric  remote-  controlled  airplanes.  _________________________________________________  Lynda Burch, 369 Big Horn Ridge Dr. NE  Medium: Watercolor   Lynda is a native of Texas who moved here in 1981. She is a  Signature Member of the New  Mexico Watercolor Society  and the Arizona Watercolor  Society. She has been juried  into many shows throughout  the Southwest in the last few  years. She is currently  showing in the Nob Hill Art  Gallery Artist Coop, the  Yucca Art Gallery in  Albuquerque, and the Mineral  and Fossil Gallery in Santa Fe  and Taos. Lynda likes “using  color in a big vibrant way,  creating moods to set the tone of the work.”  _________________________________________________  Linda Manion, 2876 Brushwood St.  Medium: Pencil  Linda is a self-taught artist,  known for the sensitive and  personal quality of her work.  She began her pencil artistry as  a child. Linda offers  commissioned portraits of  animals, children, and family  compositions. Working from  photographs, Linda’s drawings  are truly portraits of individuals,  exploring the range of  personality and individuality of  each subject. The setting of the  Southwest continues to inspire  her work.    Stanley N. Schmidt, 656 Roadrunner Lane NE  Medium: Wood  Stan’s plunge into the commercial stringed instrument market  started in 1998,  with much addi- tional technical   research accom- panied by intense  acoustical and engineering testing of his instrument designs.  Stan’s Stradivari ‘Grande’ violin model, which has been  nicknamed The Max, took first-place award overall for tone,  workmanship and varnish at the VMAAI (the oldest violin  makers’ association in the US) in 2002.   _________________________________________________  Terry Lee Heller, 1233 Goldenrod NE  Medium: Oil  Terry studied art at The Tyler School  of Art in Philadelphia and Queens  College in New York. She has  exhibited in group shows in New  York and New Mexico, and has had  several solo exhibitions at Coleman  Gallery in Albuquerque. Whether a  painting begins with an idea from  within or a view from the world,  Terry always ends up attending to the  formal concerns of the piece above  any story or content as such. Despite  its somewhat abstract appearance, her  work is narrative.  _________________________________________________  Ralph Rudolph, 1044 Red Oaks Lp NE  Medium: Ceramic  Ralph has done artwork of  all types all his life,  exhibiting at galleries in  Pennsylvania. As a juried  artist at the Nob Hill  Gallery in Albuquerque, he  has concentrated on  ceramic wall art as an  unusual medium combining  color, texture, and form.      _________________________________________________  R. Peter Buttner, 1151 Marigold NE  Medium: Pencil and Watercolor  Peter has lived in Sandia Heights for over 20 years. He taught  for the U.S. Navy  and in public  schools. There are  no rulers or straight  edges used—it is all  in freehand using  either a postcard or a  photo. He concen- trates on European  scenes, but does  cowboy art also.

As we announced in the September issue of the   Grit, these devices (called “chokers”) were placed due to the  efforts of the Bernalillo County Fire Department and the Public  Works Department.          The SHHA and Bernalillo County are soliciting input from  residents of the immediate neighborhood to determine the  effectiveness of the devices.  In particular, the county would   like to know how well they reduce the frequency of extreme  speeding that puts pedestrians at risk on this residential street.        The county will be collecting quantitative data on safety   and traffic flow on San Rafael during the 3-month trial period.   This data will be presented to residents at the January board  meeting of the SHHA.          Sandia Heights is unlike most neighborhoods.  Our roads   are shared by pedestrians, bicyclists, automobiles, (and even  skaters and skateboarders).  They are narrow and curvy, and   have speed limits that are lower than many residents wish to  drive.  These properties put special demands on the Traffic,  Safety, & Environment Committee to keep our residents and  environment safe. If you have concerns please attend the Town  Meeting.

JADE ENTERPRISES, INC has been  designing, building and remodeling in  Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque  Acres for over 20 years and we have come  to know many residents in the area. We  want to be sure that when you call us you  are calling JADE ENTERPRISES, INC and  not a different contractor by the name of  Jade General Contractor.       JADE ENTERPRISES, INC is located  in the Quail Run Shopping Center on the  corner of San Rafael and Tramway. We are  listed in the white pages as JADE  ENTERPRISES, INC Design and  Construction. We are also listed in the  Yellow Pages under the heading  “Contractors-Remodel.” Jade General  Contractor is listed under “Contractors- General.”       Although we are not in competition with  this commercial contractor, many people are  calling him by mistake and never getting a  call back. If you thought were calling and  did not get a return call we apologize for  whatever the reason behind it. If you would  like to refer us to a neighbor or friend please  use the word “Enterprises” and not “General  Contractor.” Our phone number is 856- JADE.  -Jeff Speck, President  Jade Enterprises, Inc.    OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST:    Acting on a resident’s complaint, I went to  Little Cloud Park and witnessed about 50  teenagers gathered in the arroyo under the  Tramway Blvd bridge. They were having  fun doing stunts on their bikes, but they  were also drawing graffiti and discarding  trash including beer cans in people’s yards.  This is illegal!  We will be working with the  Sheriff to stop this activity.  Parents: DO  YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR  TEENAGERS ARE?     Political signs: For the most part, our  covenants do not bar political signs, but they  do litter the neighborhood. Please take them  down and keep Sandia Heights natural and  beautiful.     HOUSE DISTRICT 22 STATE  RESPRESENTATIVE (elect)  -Kathy McCoy       As your new State Representative (elect),  I am writing to introduce myself and to ask  for your help in ways to keep connected to  your area. With a mountain in the middle of  it, House District 22 presents a logistical  challenge: in the Sandia Heights area, the  southern boundary is San Bernardino; the  northern boundary is the Tierra Monte  subdivision; there is a small strip just on the  west side of Tramway, then it goes east to  the mountain. The rest of my district  includes the East Mountain area (including  Carnuel), parts of Edgewood, and Placitas.  So I have parts of three counties rather  spread apart. Needless to say, I’ll be putting  some mileage on my car to stay in touch  with people.       I am extremely grateful to the folks at  The Grit who allowed me to get this  message out. I have no opposition in  November, so I am using this time to get to  better know the people in my district and  learn their concerns. To that end, I am  building an e-mail distribution list. 1) to  keep you informed of issues that affect you  and the state; 2) to seek your opinions on  issues that come before the state legislature;  and 3) to give you a fast and relatively  painless way to reach me regarding your  concerns.  If you are interested in being included on the  list, please e-mail me: Katrina@swcp.com.  For those who would rather call, my phone  is 281-9540. Finally, I would like to say how  profoundly honored I am to have been  elected to fill this seat. Having worked for  two years as the now retired Representative  Ron Godbey’s aide in Santa Fe, I learned a  great deal, but I’ll need your input to know  how to best represent you. I encourage you  to contact me.   The GRIT                                                                                                                            Page 11  Letters to the Editor  The comments and opinions expressed do not necessarily represent the view of the SHHA.     Bike Etiquette  I ride my bike on the Tramway Lane trail to Elena Gallegos 3-4 times a week. At least once a week I  have to ask people to move out of the entrance and exit paths to the trails. It is nice to see someone  that you know when you are out working out but it is very rude and inconsiderate to block the trail  while engaged in conversation, so please move off to the side to continue your socializing. Also,  those of you with small children - especially children on bikes – keep them with you. I came around  a corner last week and almost hit a young child on a bicycle head on. He was on the wrong side of  the trail with his head down, not watching where he was going. Last year, a woman in our complex  was riding her bike and was hit by another cyclist. She suffered a fractured pelvis and was disabled  for 6 months. I do not want anyone else to get hurt, especially a young child, so please practice trail  etiquette and watch your children.  -Deb Boehme, Resident    Cats  I am an agitated homeowner. On Quail Run Drive we see many cats these days and most are using  my yard at 2014 as their dumping space. It sure takes the joy out of gardening and I have had to stop  feeding the birds since these cats catch and eat birds, too. Cats should be kept at home. Keeping pets  at home makes for good neighbors, I think. Is there a solution or should I become the first SHHA  member with a pet coyote in my yard?  -Phyllis Cubbage, Resident    Gardener’s Calendar by Dan Caudillo    Mid October   Balloon Fiesta time is here.   Harvest tomatoes before the first freeze. Put green tomatoes in a sunny window to ripen.   Last chance to plant peony.   This is an optimum time to plant bulbs before the ground freezes and selection becomes poor. Plant  various bulbs such as tulips, daffodils, crocus, hyacinths and paper whites.    Late October   The first killing frosts usually arrive by now.   If so, cut back on watering frequency and water later in the day such as 9:00 or 10:00 A.M.   If you have an outdoor pond, shut off the pump and remove it so that freezing doesn’t damage it.   Halloween is Monday, October 31st. By the way, Daylight Saving Time ends today so set your clocks  back one hour.   What’s blooming in October? Abelia, roses, and Russian sage (shrubs); Cherry sage, coral bells,  hummingbird trumpet, maximillian sunflower, mountain aster, bedding asters, red valerian, regal  mist, and Mexican evening primrose (perennials); Liatris and canna lily (bulbs); Dianthus,  snapdragons, pansy, ornamental kale, and English primrose.    Early November   This is a great time to begin your fall/winter garden cleanup. Cut perennials to the ground, shape  evergreen and deciduous shrubs, and rake fallen debris.   Cut a firebreak around your house by trimming dormant grasses to the ground 20 feet away from the  house or other structures.   Time to feed lawn and other outdoor plants with a winterizer fertilizer.   Set water lilies to the deepest part of the pond to prevent them from freezing.
