  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association             April – May 2004    SHHA Winetasting  By: Mona Lee Schilling    The ANNUAL WINE TASTING  event is fast approaching. Have you mailed  in your reservation yet? The event is open to  all Sandia Heights residents and their guests  over the age of 21. It would be appreciated if   you would respond as soon as possible. This  will help in planning the hor d’oeuvres to be  served.   The Wine Tasting Festival has  enjoyed very successful attendance in the  past and a large response is expected this  year. In view of our beautiful weather and  the wonderful mountains, the patio will be  open this year to enjoy.  The Silent Auction, which was added  last year, was also a great success, thanks to  the many generous donations. Businesses or  individuals planning to donate items are  asked to please bring them to the office at  least a week early. This year each person  donating is asked to specify a minimum  price for the item. The donors name will be  printed on cards placed with each item and  will also be acknowledged on the individual  auction list for the item. Hope to see you  there! Reservations will also be accepted at  the SHHA office.                  Eckerd Drugstore Redesigned!  By: Ralph Rudolph & Bob Francis    A Special Committee met with Tricor and  Eckerd Drugs to discuss residents’ concerns  regarding the design and lighting of the  Eckerd Drugs being erected at the  intersection of San Bernardino and  Tramway Blvd.     At what will prove to be a considerable  expense to themselves, Eckerd put together  a “crash” program to redesign the store’s  appearance to be more pleasing to SHHA,  and presented these plans to the Committee.  The rooftop “cupolas” will be changed from  the triangular design to much lower flat  structures, and tinted windows will be  installed on the storefront to reduce light  emissions during the evening. As Eckerd  explained, they wish to be good neighbors  and they were quite apologetic that any  controversy had occurred.    Part of the problem with the Eckerd   situation results upon how the Bernallilo  Zoning Commission operates, as there is no  procedure to notify SHHA about proposed  commercial construction, and no method for  us to provide input. County Commissioner  Tim Cummins has met with us several times  to try to find a means of improving  communications with Zoning and may  propose an “overlay” zone for Sandia  Heights to require such consultation over  design. So yes, a problem has been found to  exist and solutions are being sought. We can  wish that Developers such as Tricor -  (Continued on Page 3)  Neighborhood Announcements   Extended SHHA office hours!

The Directors, new and old,  need to represent all districts because with  only about 20 directors, each district cannot  have its individual representative. As stated  by one of the new Board candidates, he  would like to see Sandia Heights considered  as one entity.  But for the time being, we  bring unique interests to the Board from the  many units/districts within Sandia Heights.  The current representation is shown on the  table on the next page.  You will note that  we are not well represented from these  districts: Sandia, Cedar, Hawk, and Quail. If  you have concerns and want to speak out as  a member of the Board of Directors from an  under represented unit, now is the time.     New Directors will be elected at the Annual  Meeting on Saturday June 5, 2004. We need  you to replace those that are retiring. Board  members are elected for 3-year terms, serve  on at least one and possibly two of the seven  standing committees and attend monthly  meetings of the Board. Generally it is  believed that it takes about four to six hours  a week of your time. To preserve the Sandia  Heights we all enjoy and love, being a  member of the board is a rewarding  opportunity. We need representation from  all of the units on the Board and we urge  you to consider taking this opportunity to  become a board member. Sandia Heights is  essentially a mature Homeowners  Association with new bylaws approved last  year. Consequently, we will be moving into  a new phase of our existence. The next few  years will be an exciting opportunity for you  to help plan the future of our association.  Please review the Blue pages of the 2003  Directory of Residents, which lists the duties  of the committees and other functions of the  Board. If you are prepared to serve as a  Director, we urge you to contact the SHHA  office at 797-7793 or any of the  Nominations Committee members and  submit a short resume reflecting your  experience and interest in working on the  Board of Directors.    Chuck McLeod, Heinz Schmitt, Richard  Frederiksen - Nominations Committee    Eckerd Drugstore Redesigned!  (Continued from front page)    - Southwest would have been more aware of  the special character of neighborhoods  where they are developing stores to aid them  in selecting the best design, and the  establishment of an overlay zone could help  with this in the future. We have learned a lot  ourselves, and are now actively working  with the developers of the Albuquerque  Kwik Lube  (See accompanying article by  Don Wortman).  We will remain vigilant  regarding any future construction to  safeguard our community. Thanks to good  work by all, we have a win-win situation.    Don’t Forget, The Annual  Wine Tasting is Just Around  the Corner!    When: April 24th, 4-7pm.  Where: Futures for Children, right here in  the neighborhood.  Why: For a good cause and good times with  your neighbors.  How: Sign up with the  reservation form in your  last utility bill or stop by  the SHHA office.

This article is offered in continuation of that theme.    For the past 12 months a team of residents, namely Frank Soper( Unit 10), Chair of the Covenant Support  Committee and BOD member; Gene Church(Unit 11), Volunteer; Don Hooper(Unit 28), Volunteer and  ex ACC Chair; Ray Tuegel (Unit 11), Volunteer and myself(Unit 15), Chair of this team,  member of  CSC and BOD, have been working on a set of Unified Covenants which could replace the existing set of  some thirty two Unit specific Covenants. This will convert a binder full of the present individual  Covenants to a single 30 page document. This Unification activity has been sanctioned by the SHHA  BOD.    The motivations behind this Unification task are to provide:  1. Maintenance and enhancement of individual and community property values.  2. Architectural Harmony in Sandia Heights.  3. Consistency of new construction and modifications.  4. Clarity of SHHA expectations.  5. A Standard for Sandia Heights.    6. Ease and consistency of ACC and CSC reviews.  7. Improved readability and understanding of SH covenants.  8. Additional Covenant benefits to earlier SH Units.    We will be presenting the Unified Covenants to the Board of Directors for comments in the near future.  The present Covenants cannot be amended without the approval of 75% of the property owners in a given  Unit. Therefore our plan includes bringing these Unified Covenants to the residents for review and  approval. We are presently discussing how best to communicate the process by which the unified  Covenants were generated and what the benefits and impact of the Unification will be if you agree to  them. This initiative is intended to provide value for you the residents not to create more restrictions. If  you have suggestions as to how this activity and the results could best be presented to you the property  owners please provide them to the SHHA office for the attention of the Covenant Unification Team.  Additional communications to you will be forthcoming.  SHHA MEMBER CLASSIFIEDS  (Free for SHHA members as space allows)    Experienced 18 yr.  Old House Sitter  Have references.

The two most noteworthy changes  in terms of harmony with our neighborhood  are: 1) the three triangular elements will be  reduced to flat level elements, a reduction  from 36 feet to 28 feet; 2) the building will  be repainted in one uniform color called  Arizona Tan with the brick red trim  remaining as it is now.      SHHA officers met with Chad Hagle of  Tricor and Jim Ross of Eckerd on March 15  to discuss these and other concerns. The  meeting proved to be very productive and  Jim Ross made it very clear that Eckerd  intends to be a good neighbor. Other items  discussed were signs, hours of operation (8  to 10 during the week and 10 to 7 on  Sunday), internal illumination and   landscaping. Jim Ross volunteered that  Eckerd does not plan to sell liquor at this  store.      SHHA’s Special Liaison Committee has had  productive discussions with George Burnell,  the developer of the Albuquerque Kwik  Lube that is underway north of Eckerd. He  has reduced the height of his building and  the size of his signs in accord with our  requests. His building has many southwest  adobe style features. George Burnell and his  co-developer, Matt Musgrave, have room  for two more retail buildings in the area  between Eckerd and where the Kwik Lube  will be located. We will continue our  discussions with them about their future  plans for this property.     Jim Ross has requested that any further  concerns about the building be directed  through us to him so that the new store  manager is left free to run the business.               Thanks again to Jenison Klinger and William Dawes for hosting the  March meeting at their home.      Mr. George Duda, from the NM State Forestry Department  presented “Impacts of Drought, Forest Fires and Disease”.  It was an  extremely informative subject and his presentation was very  entertaining.   His gift of indigenous tree seedlings to some of the  members was greatly appreciates.     Next Meeting:     Wednesday May 19, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.  This is the annual brainstorming meeting to discuss options for the  club’s activities for next year.  In addition, Dan Caudillo will present  "Rare, Unusual and New Plant Varieties For Your Garden".  All  Sandia Heights residents are invited to join us for this program.    If you are not a club member but are interested in attending, please  contact Ray Ching at 822-1489 for the meeting place.     Future Activities:   June 12, 2004:  Annual Garden Walk  Mid August (Date to be announced):  Field Trip to the NMSU Plant  Materials Center Open House in Los Lunas      To become a member, please send a check for the annual membership fee of $8.00/person or $10.00/couple payable to  the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club to: Susan Cook, 1842 Tramway Terrace Loop NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.    The GRIT  Page 11  Letters to the Editor    The comments and opinions expressed do not necessarily represent the views of the SHHA    Police Seek Foothills Muggers (Adapted from the Albuquerque Journal, March 17, 2004)  Albuquerque Police are looking for two Hispanic men in their early 20’s who have threatened  and robbed about nine people outside homes near Tramway NE. The robberies started in  January. Last weekend, the duo hospitalized their first victim, said Det. Scott Parsons. “They  come up to people in their garage or driveways with a bat demanding money and threatening to  hit them,” Parsons said. “They injured a lady last weekend when they hit her from behind. She  was taken to the hospital, but the injuries were not severe.” The attacks “Have become more  frequent and more violent.” Parsons said. “It’s a disturbing trend.” The two suspects have been  taking wallets and purses containing about $20 to $30, and the attacks have occurred between  7:30 pm and midnight. Police believe the two men “Walk around the neighborhoods and follow  (residents) into the their homes as they are coming home,” Parsons said. Anyone with  information about the two men should call Crime Stoppers at 843-STOP.  -Lauda Miles    Speed Humps Work!  I have been a resident on the NE corner of Live Oak Road for almost 26 years. The curve below  the most western hump is on a down-hill slope and is improperly banked outwardly. The curve  also makes it very difficult to see oncoming foot, bike or motor traffic in either direction. I have  personally seen/or have seen the results of several accidents that have occurred in that area. As  far as speed traps go on Live Oak Road I personally am aware of only 2 speed humps but I have  seen up to 6 vehicles pulled in Live Oak Place at one time. One officer said that we they are only  pulling them over if they are exceeding twice the posted speed! After a rollover accident and  some comments made by the Sheriff about the roadway being banked incorrectly, I called the  County Highway Department. The engineer responsible for this area came out and looked over  the situation. Several days later a County crew was installing the speed humps! To my  knowledge, there have been no accidents since the speed humps were installed although the  speed and volume of traffic have progressively and significantly increased.  -Fred Reed, Resident    The Not-So-Obnoxious Eckerd Building  I find Don Wortman’s stance adversarial in his article. Who would want to work with a person  with such an attitude? That property has been zoned for commercial use for many years. It  should come as no surprise that a business has bought the property. To demand that they change  their construction after it has gone up, rather than in the planning stages, is unreasonable in my  opinion. Frankly, I think Eckerd has done a good job of blending the design of their building  with the designs and colors prevalent in Sandia Heights. If we had been proactive, we might have  been able to influence them to omit the cupolas. I’d like to see our board of directors take a  gentler more reasoned approach instead of being adversarial. Let’s generate friends not enemies.  -Ruth Friesen                              PRESORTED STD.  U.S. POSTAGE  PAID  PERMIT #375  ALBUQUERQUE, NM    Sandia Heights Homeowners Associa- tion  2-B San Rafael, NE  Albuquerque, NM 87122                    Dan Caudillo’s Garden Calendar    Early May  •  “Safe from late frosts”. Time to plant warm season vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, egg  plant, melons, squashes, and cucumbers and annuals dahlia, lobelia, nasturtium, verbena,  cosmos, zinnia, coleus, marigold, aster and alyssum).   •  De-thatch warm season lawns.    Mid-May  •  Second feeding of your cool season lawn and the first feeding of your warm season lawn.  •  Time to plant warm season grass seed such as buffalo or blue gramma grasses.  •  Place a few pennies in your birdbath. Copper deters fungal growth and is safe for the  birds.  •  Watering should be set to higher frequency to reflect the hotter growing months.    Late May  •  Prune early season flowering shrubs and vines such as lilac, forsythia, winter jasmine,  flowering almond, and wisteria. You can prune up to the second week of June.  •  Time to use a granular fungicide on your prize lawn (chiefly fescue and bluegrass) to  prevent summer fungal problems
