  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           November 2004    HAPPY THANKSGIVING    PHOTO CONTEST!   The SHHA is having its annual photo contest for the 2005 Sandia Heights Resident Directory.  Submissions are due to the SHHA office by November 19. If you are the lucky winner, your photo  will be featured on the cover of the 2005 Directory, and you will be acknowledged as the  photographer. Submission criteria:  o Photos (a maximum of two per resident) must be related to the Sandia Heights area (see the  2004 Directory).  o Photos must be able to fit reasonably on the cover of the directory without loss of the  composition.  o Photos must be in color, and may be submitted digitally or as a hard copy.  o You must be a member of SHHA to enter, and you must be an amateur photographer.  o The resident must submit a statement that the photograph is an original taken by the  homeowner, that he/she is not a professional photographer (in business as a photographer),  and that you grant permission to SHHA to use the photo.    All entries may be picked up at the office once the Directory is published. Be creative and good luck!    From the President    Town Hall: The Town Hall meeting on October 17th was a disappointment because only about 25  Association members attended, too few to have a quorum to vote on the Bylaws. We will have to  schedule another meeting or delay the voting until the Annual Meeting next June.     Minutes of the Town Hall portion are available at the office for anyone interested. In brief, our  newest Board member, Vicki Criel, was introduced. As our new head of Membership Services, she  gave a pep talk on how she would like to develop a better sense of community.    Frank Soper reported that the new Unified Covenants will be presented to the Board for its review in  November before being presented to Association members for voting.     The “traffic chokers” installed on San Rafael were a major point of discussion. Over 70 written  complaints have been received. Mark Boslough, our Traffic & Safety chairman, explained that the  county is “evaluating” them for 90 days and will meet with us at the end of that period. We can hope  there are no serious accidents while they remain in place, but I know a few folks who have bent  wheels or misaligned suspensions from hitting them.    Other comments called for more openness in the newsletter and on reporting what happens in  committees, such as the ACC.  It was pointed out that SHHA has undergone major changes in the  past few years and is much more open than it has ever been. We will expand GRIT coverage.    Arts View:  The inaugural Arts View event went very well, with many residents visiting the artists’  homes, chatting and getting to know each other. Participants seemed very pleased that we started this  new event. We will be starting other new events, such as music under the stars.

Even though last month the issue was at  the printer by Oct 1st, some of you didn't receive your issue  until mid-month. The Post Office has stated that because this   is an election year, it is inundated with bulk mail. At this time,  there is nothing we can do to get the bulk mail processed faster  by the post office. Once election season is over, we can expect  the newsletter to arrive sooner. Thank you for your  understanding.   9 Although the Town Hall meeting was announced on the front  page of the September issue and on our website, it seems that  several people forgot about it. It was mentioned again in the  October Grit but, unfortunately, those issues were received  after the date had already passed. In the future, we will make  an effort to send out a flyer or a utility bill stuffer to promote  SHHA member awareness.  9 There is a wealth of information on our website  www.sandiahomeowners.org. The site is updated regularly.  You can find copies of your covenants, ACC forms, board  minutes, notices and much more. Check it out!  9 Trash pick-up reminder: Please make sure that you are putting  out the trash no earlier than 5pm the day before trash pickup  and no later than 7am the day of trash pickup. Thank you for  your efforts in keeping Sandia Heights beautiful.    Traffic & Safety Committee:  The county is planning to hold a meeting regarding the chokers   but as of press time, the meeting had not been scheduled.    Please call the office or check our website for further information.  - Mark Boslough      Neighborhood Announcements:  o Office Hours are from 9am to 3pm, Monday  through Friday.  o SHHA Board Meeting Wednesday, November  10 at 7 pm.  o The office will be closed November 25 & 26.  o We now have a notary public in our office.

Bernalillo County Code Section 66-225 (c) states:     66-225 (c)  “The setback area and all plantings therein shall be maintained by the owner,  occupant or agents in charge of the adjoining property”.    The Operations and Maintenance Department will respond to requests for functional, shoulder,  drainage ditch or borrow ditch mowing, grading, and/or clearing both up and down stream  from private driveways, but not including private driveways. Please call 848-1503 if you  would like to report any of these problems.  The width of this service ranges from 0 feet to  7 feet from the edge of the road depending on the posted speed limit, pursuant to AASHTO  Standards providing for a “Clear Zone” for traffic safety.  Only certain items are allowed  in the clear zone, such as mail boxes, break-away fire hydrants, and break-away street  signs, which do not interfere with traffic safety.      Maintenance of decorative landscaping or removal of weeds or trash against a property  fence, or maintenance of the driveway condition, or private tree limbs hanging within the  right of way is the adjoining property owner’s duty and responsibility.     In addition, the throwing of greenwaste or other debris into the setback area is technically  defined as illegal dumping and carries a possible $1000 fine and/or imprisonment.   Yard waste  and refuse must be disposed of properly.  The Solid Waste Department (224-1639) can give  information about free and low cost refuse deposit locations and free curbside appliance removal  services.    For more detailed information on what is allowed in the setback area by property  owners, call 848-1503.

If you do this early, mulches have several months to compost.   We are entering the coldest past of the year, so set irrigation timers to water once a week or  less and be sure to begin watering about 11:00 am.  Late November   Place a log in your pond so that fish can get oxygen. Stop feeding fish until warmer weather.   Fill your birdbath daily so that birds have a constant source of water.   This is a great time to begin your Christmas shopping to avoid the crowds.  Early December   December is the least windy month, has the highest relative humidity, receives the most snow,  and is the second coldest month of the year.   Bulbs forced indoors (for holiday color and fragrance) should be placed in a bright sunny  window now.   Continue feeding birds throughout the winter.   Select an ice melt that is safe to use around plants or just use sand.   There are two main types of Christmas trees: Douglas fir and Noble fir. To check whether your  tree is fresh, grasp a branch and pull along the stem. Needles should remain on the tree and not in  your hand.   Use a humidifier to add moisture to indoor air; doing so will eliminate sore/scratch noses and  throats.
