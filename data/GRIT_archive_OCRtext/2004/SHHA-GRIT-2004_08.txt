  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association          August - September 2004    SHHA wins significant lawsuit!    A new owner purchased an existing house in Unit 14 in 2001. The new owner applied  to the SHHA Architectural Control Committee (ACC) on September 20, 2001, to  expand the house by enlarging the garage. After meeting with the new owner to  discuss various options, the ACC denied the construction request in October 2001.  The enlarged garage would have required a front and side set-back variance.     Like almost all units in Sandia Heights, the covenants applicable to all lots in Unit  14 prescribe front, side and rear setback requirements; in Unit 14 those reserved  setback requirements are 45' in the front and 15' in the side and rear.  The ACC  has the power to grant exceptions to those requirements for good cause when  necessary to enable a lot owner to make reasonable beneficial use of his property.    Without approval from the ACC, the new owner began pouring cement for the  foundation of the enlarged garage. The ACC issued a stop-work request on  November 16, 2001. On November 30, 2001, the ACC, in concert with immediate  neighbors, was granted a temporary restraining order by the Bernalillo County  court. The judge set a trial date to hear the merits of the ACC petition.    The trial was held in November 2003, almost two years after the lawsuit was first  started. The trial judge (Ted Baca), acting without a jury, took several more  months to render his decision. In late June, Judge Baca ruled in favor of SHHA  and has permanently enjoined construction of the garage addition. Judge Baca also  dismissed personal liability claims the new owner had asserted against the  members of the ACC which voted not to grant his requested variance.     The SHHA and the members of the ACC were represented by Albuquerque  attorney Robert B. Martinez.

These bags and bundles of trash detract from our  beautiful neighborhoods. In the interest of keeping our  neighborhoods neat and tidy, the Bernalillo County Ordinance  requires us to put our trash out no earlier than 5PM the day before  trash pickup and no later than 7AM the day of trash pickup. Trash  should be kept away from the street at all other times. If your trash  pickup occurs later in the day, as long as you put your trash out  before the truck arrives, you will be in good shape. The 7AM time  is to insure that those of us who are scheduled for early pickup will  not be left holding the bag, so to speak.    If you are going to be out of town and not able to put your trash  out in accordance with the above guideline, there are a couple of  things you can do. One is to ask a neighbor to place your trash at  the curb in accordance with the guideline. The second is to take  your trash to the Eagle Rock Convenience Center located at 6301  Eagle Rock Rd. NE prior to leaving. This trash drop-off center is  located near the intersection of Alameda and San Pedro. It is op 7 days a week from 8AM to 5PM and charges $3.00 pe en  r load.         Attention Art Lovers,  Creators and Appreciators,  An art committee has been formed in Sandia Heights to showcase the  talent in our community. An event called “ArtsView @ Sandia  Heights” will introduce several artists and their works to residents and  guests of Sandia Heights in a tour of studios. ArtsView takes place on  Sunday, October 24, 2004, from 1-5 PM.  The October issue of the grit will have a map of studio  locations and more detailed information on the artists and  event.  Sandia Heights is blessed with more artists than can be  presented in this one showcase, so with your support this is the  first of many ArtsViews.      Artists who are interested to participate should contact  Khondeh Payne (797-4306 khondeh@comcast.net).    The GRIT                                                                     Page 3  MOSTLY CLASSICAL AT YOUR BACK  DOOR By Gene Church    Well, maybe not quite your back door. It’s really  around the end of the Sandia Mountains via I-40  to exit 175, and then 3/4 mile north on Highway  14. This is the setting for a musical adventure  that probably not too many of us know about.

Parks & New Development  Committee By Mark Boslough    Please report extreme speeding to sheriff    Several incidents of extreme speeding have  been reported over the last month.  On July 11, a resident of Bobcat reported a  motorcyclist speeding back and  forth on Bobcat at speeds up to 70 mph.  He  repeatedly ran the stop sign at the corner of  Bobcat and Deer Drive.    On the morning of July 13, a resident of  Tramway Lane was standing next to the street  with his 6-year-old daughter when two cars,  side by side, raced past at speeds up to 65  mph.    Another resident of Tramway Lane reported  motorcycle racers flying by his house on July  28 at about 55 mph.    Please, if you observe this behavior, report it  to the Bernalillo County Sheriff immediately.   Even if you did not get a license number, this  is a serious crime and needs to be  documented.    STUCCO WARNING  By Bob Francis  Communications and Publications    If you want to re-stucco your home, you  should be aware of the type of stucco being  used. Stucco containing plastic or synthetic  material may trap water inside your walls.  This condition could cause mold or invite  unwanted insects such as ants, and/or  termites. If your contractor wants to use  plastic stucco, be sure you get a warranty in  writing which protects you from these  conditions.      Neighborhood Announcements     Extended SHHA office hours!

The county  officials assured members of the SHHA  Board that they take our  neighborhood's speeding problems  seriously.  Bernalillo County Fire Marshal  Kent Hendrickson had vetoed the attempt of  residents of San Rafael and Tramway Lane  to have speed humps installed on their  streets.  Now he and Fire Chief Bett Clark  are working with Richard Mobarak--a  Traffic Engineer from the Public Works  Department--to find an alternative traffic  calming measure that will make our streets  safer without the risk of slowing down  emergency response vehicles.    Chief Clark presented the idea of installing  traffic calming devices called "chokers" on  San Rafael, as a pilot project.   Mr. Mobarak  described the preliminary design, which  constricts the road at strategic locations and  forces traffic to slow down.  Other  municipalities have had good luck with  these devices, which have been shown to  improve pedestrian safety.  The county will  collect data to determine their effectiveness  before installing them elsewhere.    There was no disagreement about the need  to slow down traffic on San Rafael. The  only debate is about the methods.  Data  collected three years ago demonstrates that  about 90% of drivers exceed the posted  speed limit. Everyone agrees that this is  unacceptable on a multiple use residential  street like San Rafael.  The survey detected  vehicles speeding past at more the double  the speed limit every two minutes during a  peak hour in the morning--when children are  walking to bus stops.  Over the four-day  period of the survey, three extreme speeders  were tracked moving in excess of 51 mph in  the 15 mph zone!  This survey took place  near the intersection of San  Rafael and Laural Loop, which is close to  the proposed location of one of the new  chokers.  The preliminary design  specifications and drawings are on display at  the SHHA office, at 2-B, San Rafael.    KWIK LUBE OPENS    Albuquerque Kwik Lube opened on August  2nd. SHHA has had a constructive  relationship with George Burnell and Matt  Musgrave, the owners, and we want to  encourage our residents to take their autos  there. I did on opening day and I was  impressed with their competence and  courtesy. Their main focus is preventive  maintenance and that includes oil changes,  transmission services, radiator flushes, air  filters, fuel filters and emission testing.     They are open from 8 AM-6 PM Monday  through Friday and from 8 AM-5 PM on  Saturday. The full service oil change  including at least 20 individual maintenance  tasks (vacuuming and window washing  among them) is $29.99. You can get a $5  discount on your first oil change if you show  them this article. Their phone number is  821-9090.     George Burnell is the manager. He is a  “local boy” trying to make good in his own  business. He managed Jiffy Lube stations  for over ten years. George is married and  they have two young children.     We are meeting with George to review the  plans for a proposed six retail unit building  that will be constructed between the empty  Eckerd building and the Kwik Lube  building.     Many of you have probably noticed that  TRICOR, the owners of the empty building,  have now employed Grubb and Ellis, who  specialize in commercial real estate, to help  them market that property.     Don Wortman, Chair  Special Liaison Committee        The GRIT    Page 8  COMMENTS FROM HOMEOWNERS AT JUNE ANNUAL MEETING:    By Ralph Rudolph, president    The homeowners gave the Association very good marks at the Annual Meeting. We distributed a  detailed list of their few complaints to the Board at the July Meeting and asked each committee  to address them. Naturally, a good many are already being addressed. I’ll try to break these down  into several areas:    Traffic & Safety:  Complaints about speeding are ongoing. We have added a few speed bumps  and stop signs and are working with the Fire Department and other County officials to install  rumble strips and trial choke points. There were also requests to trim back the chamisa at certain  roadways. This is being coordinated with the County, but chamisa is tough stuff and has fouled  up the trimming machines.  Signage:  Sandia Heights signs used to be posted at the various entrances to our community, but  were removed because they deteriorated. The Parks Committee has been asked to look into costs  to replace them.  Fire Protection:  There were rumors that the nearby fire substation on Paseo del Norte was not  manned. It is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Dog Litter & Leashing:  These are County ordinances, not an SHHA ones. We have provided  signs for residents to post and may provide “doggie poop” stations, but we can’t do a lot more.  It’s really up to our residents to be good neighbors and obey the law. We are not police.  Better Covenant Enforcement:  Numerous issues exist: illegal RVs, boats, unpainted roof  equipment, unscreened coolers, overgrown trees blocking views, and forbidden trees such as  Siberian elms. The problem is that the Covenants require that a homeowner in the Unit file  a complaint. Without a filed complaint, the CSC is powersless. If the new unified covenants  pass, the CSC will not require the filed complaint and will be empowered to act on its own.  The CSC always acts on written complaints filed by members of SHHA.   Governance issues:  BOD meetings should have speakers on topics related to Sandia Heights.  (Note: we have as many as three at some sessions. They are usually advertised on our website).  There should be nametags for Board members. (Done!) Duties of Officers Board members and  committees should be spelled out. (The duties of Officers and Board members are spelled out in  our Bylaws, which are posted on our website. The duties of all committees are spelled out in the  Committee Charters, which will soon be posted on our website). Please post when committees  meet so interested members can attend. (We hope this will soon be on our website).  Grit:  Please spell and grammar check. (We now have such a person). Allow more controversy  in the Grit. (We allow controversy if it serves a constructive purpose).  Covenants:  Please change the Brushwood Bear Covenants to bar second-story additions. Only  the Unit’s homeowners can change the covenants by a 75% vote. We can help if necessary. One  Unit made changes on their own last year.   Miscellaneous:  Stop allowing trash to be left out days in advance of pickup. (Homeowners  should notify Bernalillo County of violations). We need a community center. (We haven’t the  money without a substantial dues increase). We want to start a gourmet group. (Write an article  for the Grit and wait for responses).
