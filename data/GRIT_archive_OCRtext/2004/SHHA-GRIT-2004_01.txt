        Board Directors Needed    Board President Bob Francis has appointed a nominations committee to provide a slate of  candidates to replace retiring Directors of Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. New  Directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting on Saturday June 5, 2004. We need you  to replace those who are retiring.  Why?  To improve the community of Sandia Heights.  To get to know your neighbors more.  To be part of designing the future of our “mature” community.  To give back in a way that preserves what you enjoy about living here.  Board members are elected for 3-year terms, serve on at least one and possibly two of the  seven standing committees and attend monthly meetings of the Board. Generally it is  believed that it takes about four to six hours a week of your time. In order to keep the  Sandia Heights we all enjoy and love, being a member of the board is a very necessary,  and rewarding job. We need representation from all of the units on the Board and we urge  you to consider taking this opportunity to become a board member. Sandia Heights is  essentially a mature Homeowners Association with new bylaws approved last year.  Consequently, we will be moving into a new phase of our existence. The next few years  will be an exciting opportunity for you to help plan the future of our association. Please  review the ivory center section of the 2004 Directory of Residents, which lists the duties  of the committees and other functions of the Board. If you are prepared to serve as a  Director, we urge you to contact the SHHA office at 797-7793 or any of the Nominations  Committee members and submit a short resume reflecting your experience and interest in  working on the Board of Directors.     Ruth Frazier, Heinz Schmitt, Richard Frederiksen  Nominations Committee    Dead Pinon Removal  In the December Grit The SHHA Board of Directors requested that residents notify the  SHHA office of dead or dying pinons on their property.  The Board has taken this  collective information to several local landscapers to negotiate the lowest possible price  for homeowners.  The SHHA will not pay for removal of pinons for residents.   Lawnshapers of Albuquerque has provided the lowest bid at $5.25 per linear foot for  removal of dead/dying pinons.  They have also quoted $6.00 per foot for hard to reach  trees and stump removal for $50 per stump if necessary.  Please contact Jeff Simmons or  Sherry Westfall at 275-0773 to arrange for these services.

By: Ralph Rudolph, VP    If you look at the statistics to the right,  kindly prepared by Matt Devlin, you’ll note  that voluntary membership in SHHA has  grown nicely during the past year, with Unit  16 at a full 100% and Units 11 and 23 at  92%. Our average membership stands at  77%, up about 10%. Therefore I stand  corrected from the figure of 66% I quoted in  the last Grit; that was last year’s data.    It’s nice to know that we’re getting  increased support as I believe we’re trying  very hard in many different ways. As I said  in my previous article, I believe that SHHA  is improving significantly and members can  be proud of what we’ve done to promote  both a sense of community and confidence  in what we do.

Mr. Zink’s phone  number was not published, so hopefully he  will see this.  My house was built in 1988  with radiant floor heat using black plastic or  rubber tubing.  It has developed leaks and  we have had to shut down two zones.  I  don’t know who the subcontractor was and  the builder, Jim McClintic, has gone  bankrupt.  I am very interested in this issue  and the Goodyear settlement.  - Sharon Chapa  1528 Eagle Ridge Dr, 505-822-1528  IMPORTANT  ANNOUNCEMENTS    ¾ Town Hall Meeting March 10th,  7:00 PM.

SHHA Covenants Are Enforced  By: James Nachbar – CSC  (Reprinted from The Grit, Winter 1994)1    Sandia Heights remains a beautiful and  unique community, in part because of the  covenants.  At the January meeting of the  SHHA Board, the Board reaffirmed the  importance of covenant enforcement to the  members of our community.  Among the  highest priorities in covenant enforcement is  the storage of boats and motor homes on  property in Sandia Heights.  There are  misconceptions about this issue.    Although many covenants do not  specifically mention motor homes because  they became popular after the writing of  some covenants, they are covered under the  word house trailers and are prohibited.    The covenants require that motor homes,  house trailers and boats, if stored on the  property must be completely enclosed in a  garage or other approved structure.  Parking  behind a fence, or using a canvas cover,  does not meet the requirement.  Instructions  on applying to the ACC for approval to  build such a structure may be obtained from  the SHHA office.    There has been confusion on the issue of  whether or not SHHA has the legal authority  to enforce all covenants.  As the  representative of homeowners in Sandia  Heights, SHHA can (and regularly does)  take action to enforce the covenants.  Enforcement of the covenants is one of the  most important missions of the SHHA.   Most homeowners voluntarily comply with  the covenants when asked by SHHA.  Most  of the rest do so after they talk with their  own attorney when contacted by SHHA’s  legal counsel.                                                      1 Footnote by Bob Francis, President, SHHA: Over  the past three years your association has removed 20  trailers and RV’s from Sandia Heights as a result of  the covenant complaints we have received.    SHHA appreciates the cooperation of those  homeowners who voluntarily comply with  the covenants, and pledges to the  homeowners of Sandia Heights that it will  continue to take the action necessary to  enforce them.        Commentary  To the woman in the large white SUV:    We were out for a walk today. As we  strolled down Deer Drive, we heard your  large vehicle behind us. As you approached  us from behind you were already speeding. I  stepped out into the street and urgently  motioned for you to slow down. You waved  at me and gunned your vehicle as you  swerved around me. As you accelerated  downhill at more than twice the speed limit,  we could see that you were looking at our  agitation in your rearview mirror.    What you were not looking at was the road  ahead as you barreled around a blind curve  in a residential neighborhood. You did not  know that ahead of you were three small  children on little bicycles with training  wheels that had gotten away from us on a  downhill run. Thank God, they had already  reached the stop sign. What were you  thinking?     This is why I am working so hard to get  speed humps for our neighborhoods.  Nobody’s time is so important that it is  worth risking a child’s life.    Mark Boslough, Traffic Safety and  Environment Chair  January 31, 2004    The Mysterious Sandia  Heights Hum  By: Philip Ciofalo  Edited by Matt Devlin    The hum phenomenon started about four  years ago in my home and environs and  steadily increased in intensity.  This  persistent 24/7 humming sound needed  investigation.  The hum has been described  as a constant low-pitched rumbling noise,  similar to a train yard, a distant jet on a  tarmac, a tractor-trailer truck idling, or a  ship turbine.  The hum can also be felt as a  vibration.    Visits to my home by the Sandia Heights  Director of Safety & Human Resources,  Environmental Health Scientists from  Bernalillo County, the alarm company  owner/manager, a certified clinical  hypnotherapist, the Albuquerque Journal  and New York Times, representatives from  PNM, Qwest, Sandia Heights Water Works,  and visiting friends and relatives have  confirmed this hum sound.  Acentech  Inc., a  sound sensing technology company based in  Cambridge MA, supplied me with sound  equipment that has also confirmed the hum  sound.  In addition, at the request of Rep.  Heather Wilson and UNM, Sandia National  Labs conducted tests with electronic trace  imaging which did detect the hum  frequency.  However this data needed  further analysis at their labs.  Also, not  everyone who has been to my house hears a  hum noise.     Published medical research states that  consistent hum vibrations, low-frequency  sound, and noise pollution may lead to  vibroacoustic disease.  Symptoms include  headaches, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and  vertigo.  Long-term exposure has also been  linked to brain damage.    Articles on this hum in my home have been  published in the Albuquerque Journal (05- 29-03), the New York Times (12-03-03), the  Chicago Tribune (12-04-03), and on  nineteen websites.  Similar hum noises have  been detected in Taos, NM, Kokomo, IN,  Larg, Scotland, Bristol, England, Italy,  Spain, Japan, and Australia.    It has been reported that possible causes of  the hum are cellular telephone towers,  communications systems that include radio  frequencies, strong broadcast radio and  television stations, as well as industrial  electromagnetic pulses.    Sandia National Labs advised me that a lack  of funds is preventing further analysis of the  data collected at my house.  To catalyze  further studies by Sandia National Labs,  UNM’s Sound Engineering Department, and  intervention by Gov. Richardson’s office,  we request input from additional Sandia  Heights residents who have experienced the  hum phenomenon or know someone who  has.      Please come by the SHHA office to sign a  petition requesting additional state and  federal funds for research.  It is very  important that we get enough signatures to  fund further investigation.  You can also  contact me (Philip Ciofalo) personally at  856-1436, or email the SHHA at  shomeowners@comcast.net if you have any  more information.    Editor’s Note:  In preparing this article I went to Mr.  Ciofalo’s residence to attempt to observe the  hum sound.  In the master bedroom and  bathroom off the Kachina room I heard a  very low hum that seemed to come and go in  a cycle.  In both cases it consistently came  from the northeast.   Unified Covenants / Covenant Review  Group Status  By: Frank Soper    The Covenant Review Group has been very busy  during the past few months with finalizing the  unified covenants and incorporating the unique  original sets of covenants for the units adjoining  Tramway Blvd., i.e. Units 16 through Unit 28C,  into the model covenants applicable to the  remaining Units of Sandia Heights.  Many hours  have been dedicated to this effort by our  volunteers.    For the next few months, our major efforts will be  presenting the unified covenants “model” to  members of the SHHA Board of Directors and an  outside land use attorney for their review and  input, and revising as necessary to include  additions which need to be made prior to  presenting this to the full Sandia Heights  population.  In the meantime a subgroup of volunteers will be  working on a plan for residents outreach so this  effort can be initiated as soon as the document is  ready for presentation.  We have explored the  options for how we can best communicate with all  residents, and as a result you will be seeing  notices, Grit articles, ect..    We have a list of volunteers who have indicated a  willingness to provide an initial review of the  “final” document and give their input, which will  be very valuable to the Committee.  These  volunteers will be contacted in the near future.    It is our goal to have a unified covenants ready for  consideration by all property owners by the  annual meeting in June.  This does not include  asking for a vote at the annual meeting; no date  has been established for that function.  At our January meeting, Dan Caudillo  spoke to us about the  “Problems with  Pinions and Ponderosa Pines.”  He  gave us valuable information on the  type of diseases that are attacking our  trees and what we can do to save them.   For our fund raising raffle, Dan  donated two of his hand crafted exotic  wood pens and Peggy Atencio donated  a wooden birdhouse.   Three lucky  members won the raffle prizes.       Many thanks to Diane and Milton  Mueller for hosting this meeting, Dan  for his great program and raffle prizes,  and Peggy and for the raffle prize.      Next Meeting:     Wednesday March 17, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.  George Duda, from NM State Forestry Department will have a presentation on. “Impacts of Drought, Forest Fires and  Disease.”   This meeting will be at the home of Jenison Klinger and William Dawes, 112 White Oakes Drive.   All Sandia Heights residents are invited to join us for this very informative program   To become a member, please send a check for the annual membership fee of $8.00/person or $10.00/couple payable to  the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club to: Susan Cook, 1842 Tramway Terrace Loop NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.  Reminder to current members:  The annual memberships were due in September.   If you have not paid yours, please  send it to Susan Cook.    PINON PINE  By: Dan Caudillo    PINON PINE  Characteristics and Habitat:  Pinons grow slowly to attain a height of 15 to 25 feet tall and spread 15 feet.  Their overall shape varies  from conical to irregular.  Short, stiff needles measure about one inch long.  The Pinon Pine is the state  tree of New Mexico.  They are found at elevations between 4,000 and 7,000 feet in dry, rocky soils, and  are often situated in hilly terrain or at the base of mountains.   Cultural Requirements:  Pinons are native to foothill regions receiving 18 inches of rainfall per year or more.  Since our area  receives only 8 to 10 inches annually (during a normal year), the key to pinon health is to infrequently  deep soak these trees every two weeks during the growing season and monthly from November through  March. Our state is entering the fourth year of a drought that is putting a further stress on these trees and  a greater need for supplemental watering.  Fertilize your trees once a year with a granulated general- purpose fertilizer just prior to new needle growth in late April or early May.  If your tree needles look  light green in color, this may be due a lack of micronutrients in the soil.    Landscape Use:  This drought tolerant plant is a small tree that won’t block favorable views.  They also make a great  windbreak or screen.  Some pinons are selected for their unusual shapes for specimen plantings.  Use it  in the fragrant garden or to create a wildlife habitat as it provides cover as well as a food source for a  variety of animals.    GARDENER'S  CALENDAR  By:  Dan Caudillo    EARLY FEBRUARY  - February is the second driest month (tied with  April), third coldest and snowiest month (tied  with March).  - Prepare vegetable/flower beds now by tilling  in mulches for future spring plantings.    - Apply last application of winterizer fertilizer  to lawns, shrubs, and trees.    - Finish up Fall/Winter clean-up chores, pruning  and raking.  Perennials are cut to the ground,  shape trees and shrubs except early bloomers  such as lilac, forsythia, and wisteria.  - Thin and head back fruit trees up to the end of  February.   - Check watering frequency for this time of  year.  Deep soak about every 10 to 21 days,  depending upon plants.  MID-FEBRUARY  - Start seedlings of cool season vegetables  indoors.  Use a quality seed starter mixes for  lettuce, broccoli, brussel sprouts, kohlrabi and  cabbage.    - Cut branches of early blooming shrubs/trees,  bring indoors, and place in a vase.  In two  weeks blooms will appear.  Forsythia,  deciduous magnolias, and many fruit and  ornamental trees work.    - Begin to dormant spray fruit trees with lime- sulphur and a second time in early March.  - Plant sweet pea seeds.   - Allergy season begins first with one-seed  junipers and Siberian elms.  - Don't for get your Valentine this year or it  can get you in a lot of trouble!  LATE FEBRUARY  - De-thatch and/or aerate cool season lawns  (Kentucky blue grass and fescues) but hold off  on fertilizing until mid-March.    - This is a great time to begin planning your  garden design.    - Check plants (especially coniferous types)  for winter aphids.  Outer leaves have a shiny  residue and the ground beneath look wet.    - What is blooming in February?  Winter  jasmine (shrub); Crocus (bulb).                             PRESORTED STD.
