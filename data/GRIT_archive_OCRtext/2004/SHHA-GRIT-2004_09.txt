  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           September 2004    President’s Message    At our July and August Board Meetings, we voted on changes to our Bylaws that a year of  experience has shown to be necessary. We also finished voting on all the Committee Charters and  they will shortly be posted on our website so members can understand the responsibilities of our  committees. The next step is for our members to approve of the Bylaws changes. Therefore we will  hold a Membership Meeting on October 16th at the Church of the Good Shepherd at 10 AM to  vote on the changes. This meeting will also be a Town Hall Meeting where members can express  their ideas and/or concerns regarding Sandia Heights and ask questions of our officers and  committees. Refreshments will be available. Please check with the office as this date nears, as it is  tentative.  A copy of our current Bylaws are available online. Go to the Board link and you will see a Bylaws  link about a quarter page down. You can also stop by the office and ask for a copy. These are the  changes the Board approved:  Section 3.6 Election of Directors: Add a sentence at the end: “It should be noted that nominations  “from the floor” are not permitted.” Explanation: a clarification of how Directors may be elected.   Section 3.11 Business Transactions. Change “The Board shall establish an agenda…” to “The  President shall establish an agenda…”  Explanation: the Board has no way to establish an agenda.  This is always up to the President.  Section 3.14 Resignations and Removal of Directors: Second sentence: Change the word “and” to  “or” following “New Mexico Non-Profit Corporate Laws or these Bylaws…” Explanation: To  correct a simple mistake.  Section 5.1 Standing Committees: Change the first sentence to read “Standing Committees are  those established in Sections 5.3 to 5.10 of the these Bylaws.” Explanation: this makes room for a  new Section 5.2.   Change third sentence to read “No Officer as defined in Sections 4.4-4.7. except for the Treasurer  who automatically heads the Finance Committee and the President, who automatically heads the  Executive Committee, may serve as a Chairman of a Standing Committee.” Explanation: we forgot  to list that the President heads the Executive Committee.  Change fourth sentence by inserting the word “other” before Standing Committees. Explanation:  Clarification of how Standing Committees elect Chairmen.  Change sixth sentence to read “Decisions and actions of all Standing Committees must be reported at  each regular Board meeting and may be subject to Board review except those of the Architectural  Control Committee.” Explanation: the Covenants do not allow for review of ACC decisions.  Section 5.2 Special Status of Architectural Review Committee: This is a new section. “Although  the Architectural Control Committee is herein defined as a Standing Committee of SHHA, it is also a  separate entity deriving its power from the various Unit’s Declarations of Restrictions, dating to the  direct transfer of responsibilities from the prior ACC’s. It should be understood that should SHHA  (for unknown reasons) cease to exist, the ACC would continue to exist.” Explanation: clarification of  the duality of the ACC to end years of debate.   Page 2  Flat Roof Problems!  -Bob Francis    Flat roof problems in Sandia Heights are a  very common occurrence. Many of the  houses built 25 years ago have flat roofs  and poor drainage.  The code for flat roofs has been changed  in the last 10 years. So-called flat roofs  are not required to have a slight slope.  With the slope that is now required, most  of the newer homes, (10 years or less)  have decent drainage.  If you have a flat roof with a low spot that  collects water, you may have a problem  and the low spot should be corrected. If  the low area collects one inch of water or  more and is more than two feet wide, the  weight of the water can add to the  problem, making the area even lower.  There are several roofing companies in  the Albuquerque area that can eliminate  the low spot. If the low spot is over the  garage, a drain can be put in to take care  of the problem. If the roof is more than 15  years old and or is in disrepair, the entire  roof should be replaced.  Low spots on your roof can be eliminated  using lightweight material made of foam.  For the do-it-yourself crowd, you must  remove the rock before gluing down the  lightweight material. Then the lightweight  material  must be covered with roofing  material and sealed with tar or plastic. The  area should probably be re–rocked.    Status of W. L. Jackson Park  by Bob Christman     The park construction is ahead of  schedule and looks like it will be complete  by the first full week of September. The  installation of the play equipment will  follow. The trees and bushes have been  planted and are now being watered by the  new irrigation system. The paths  throughout the park have been graded and  will remain decomposed granite.  The  turf/sod will be installed next week as the  base preparation is finished.  As most residents are aware by now, the  items put on hold due to lack of funds  were the basketball half court, the bocce  court and the shade structure. Sometimes  the unexpected happens. The Akerson  Family Foundation donated the shade  structure for the W. L. Jackson Park.  This  shade structure is presently being installed  as a special effort by the contractor,  Accent Landscaping, and will not affect  the completion date of the park.  The "Art Work" that has been chosen for  the park is the "Lizards".  Public opinion  did influence the final decision of the  choices on display in the SHHA Office.   Thank you to those who stopped by the  Office and indicated a preference.  The  unanimous choice was the "Lizards"!  We would expect to be using the W. L.  Jackson Park by the next article in the  Grit!

L. Jackson Park project. On June 1, 2004, 10 artists' proposals were  received. At the June 21st Arts Board meeting, the Arts Board selected three finalists. The three  finalists’ proposals were presented at the Annual Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  meeting on July 14 and remained on display in the community through the month of July. On  August 11, the Arts Board, along with designated community input, voted unanimously in favor  of recommending artist Don Kennell's proposal entitled "Sandia Allegory". The recommendation  will be presented to the Bernalillo County Board of Commissioner at the September meeting.  Mr. Kennell's proposal includes two large lizard sculptures suitable for children climbing and  seating, and three pottery shard benches. Mr. Kennell's sculpture will be located within the  central area of the park. Installation of the lizards and shards is planned for early spring.       Covenant Support Committee   by Frank Soper    Two of the suggestions received from the members at the SHHA Annual Meeting are being  addressed in this article. The first suggestion was that the CSC create a set of Unified Covenants  (UCs). The second suggestion was that we stop trying to improve the covenants, keep the old  ones and make local corrections as needed. These suggestions are obviously from “opposite sides  of the fence”. Records show that for at least the past 12 years SHHA Directors have documented  the need to change our original sets of covenants.  Approximately 20 volunteer members of the Covenant Review Group have developed, over the  past two years, a set of covenants which can be applicable to every Unit in Sandia Heights. Our  goal has been to make the covenants less ambiguous and enhance property values. Only those  involved can fully appreciate the massive research and development efforts this project has  required.  The UCs package is now in the legal review phase, using an outside land use attorney. Upon  completion of changes required by that review, the UCs will be presented to the SHHA Board of  Directors for approval and to a group of volunteer residents for their critique.  During the coming eight months a resident outreach program will bring the UCs provisions to  each property owner. We will need more volunteers for that effort.  In response to the second suggestion, the existing covenants require that if a property owner in a  Unit desires to amend their covenants, they must obtain the verified approval of 66% (one Unit)  or 75% of the owners in that Unit on a petition for amendment. SHHA does not perform this  service, but can provide the required forms. The validated documentation must then be recorded  with the Bernalillo County Clerk to become effective. Since 1965, the developers have filed five  amendments and residents have filed four amendments to the covenants. Only two developer  amendments dealt with “lifestyle” covenants changes. All existing lifestyle amendments have  been included in the UCs in order to recognize changes which were needed.  Page 6  Letters to the Editor  The comments and opinions expressed do not necessarily represent the view of the SHHA    Where’s the Pride?  In the long ago dark ages when the first units of Sandia Heights were opened, and for a  considerable time after that, Sandia Heights was considered the prestigious area on the west side  of the mountains in which to live.  In fact, the wine glasses at the annual wine tasting still  proclaim--“…The Peak of Living”. Then time, as it inevitably does, passed.  Solid substance  began to be replaced in places by veneer.  And now the veneer is becoming cracked.  Thus the  question--WHERE’S THE PRIDE?  Not all of the comments to follow pertain to all of the units of Sandia Heights.  However, I  would encourage you to check your unit covenants (do you even know that there is such a thing  that applies to you?) to see which of these comments may apply to you.  At the most recent meeting (5 June 2004) of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association,  approximately 50 people were in attendance.  This, out of approximately 1500 members of the  homeowners association, and from a total of approximately 2100 homes, all of whom are  affected by the various Unit covenants of Sandia Heights.  Where is the interest in your  community?  WHERE’S THE PRIDE?  Some of the unit covenants require screening (and maintenance of that screening) for roof  mounted heating and cooling equipment, yet much such equipment is unscreened.    And much of that which is screened is not maintained and is sore need of repair.  WHERE’S  THE PRIDE?  At some homes, trash bags are set out as much as 4, 5, or 6 days ahead of the scheduled pickup.   Do you care about the appearance of your neighborhood?  Do you care about your neighbors?   WHERE’S THE PRIDE?  The ban on Chinese elms is total in all units.  Have you noticed lately?  Have you forgotten how  to use a small saw to correct the problem?  WHERE’S THE PRIDE?  A gentleman at the last SHHA meeting brought up the issue of speeding in Sandia Heights.  To  paraphrase his remarks, he basically said--yes, contractors speed; yes delivery vehicles speed,  BUT THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF SPEEDERS ARE US, THE RESIDENTS, AND OUR  CHILDREN!!  And my observations certainly agree with this observation.  Do you care about  your neighbors’ quality of life?  More importantly, DO YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR  NEIGHBORS’ LIFE?  What gives you the right to speed, as you will, rather than obey the law as  is done by the rest of the people?  WHERE’S THE PRIDE?  Lots of trees have been planted over the years.  Yes, they were meant to provide some character  for your property.  But have you noticed how tall they have become?  Have you noticed that  some of them are obliterating your neighbors view?  Have you considered your neighbors’ view  to be as important as your own?  Do you even care?  WHERE’S THE PRIIDE?   Sandia Heights, of all of the subdivisions in the metropolitan area, has the capability of being  “The Peak of Living”.  But to retain that position, it will take some effort, some concern, some  care - and we must be aware that time could be running out! So I end as I began - WHERE’S  THE PRIDE?  -Gene Church, Resident    Note from the editor:  Other letters were received but because of limited space we were unable to add them to this issue.  They may appear in the October Grit Issue as space allows.  Page 7  Traffic chokers  Thanks to the efforts of the Bernalillo County Fire Department and Public Works Department,  San Rafael is going to get traffic calming devices called "chokers".  We expect these safety  features to slow down the speeders and make the street safe for pedestrians.  If you live on San  Rafael, your input is needed by the SHHA and the county to determine the effectiveness of the  devices.  In particular, the county would like to know how well they reduce the frequency of  extreme speeding which puts pedestrians at risk on this residential street. There are plans in the  office for your viewing.

The Trash pickup article in  the Aug-Sept Grit improperly advised that if pickup occurs later in the day the 7AM “deadline”  is not necessary. Sandia Heights Services must often revise its pickup route schedules, so it is  required that all trash be put out by 7AM on your scheduled pickup day.   -Frank Soper  Covenant Support Committee    SHHA MEMBER CLASSIFIED  (free for SHHA members as space allows)    Experienced Pet  Sitter:  Hardworking, positive  attitude 15 yr.
