According to these newly  published studies the toll is much higher than  previously reported.  In the United States,  outdoor cats are the leading cause of death for  birds and mammals.  Of course cats are not the  only cause of mortality for birds, but they are the  most significant.         Nature Communication, journal states that  the number of birds killed in the United States  by outdoor pet cats, was estimated to be between  1.4 billion and 3.7 billion each year. This same  journal suggested that feral and owned cats kill  an estimated half a billion birds annually.   Researchers from the Smithsonian Conservation  Biology Institute and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service reported even higher numbers for the  mammalian population. Their reported numbers  ranged from 6.9 billion to 20.7 billion mammals  killed by cats each year.

The cats were  indoor/outdoor pets.  Their time indoors depended on the  weather and age of the cat.  My father even made several cat  doors before they were a purchasable item, and in desperation  cut a hole in the wall of our house to accommodate our family  pet cats.  These cats were valued members of our family, and  not once did we consider these pets to be felon murderers. Little  did we know the carnage caused by our three cats Nuttsie,  Angie and Dolly, to the bird and mammal populations in Raton,  New Mexico.       In the harsh climate of Raton, two of our cats lived to be  twenty (20) plus years, and the third cat approximately fifteen  (15) years.  All died of old age, escaping eight out of their nine  lives. According to Peter Marra, senior editor, of the  Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute publication,  indicated from their research and ninety (90) different studies  they estimated one pet cat kills between one (1) and thirty-four  (34) birds a year.  Their estimate for a feral cat was between  twenty-three (23) and forty-six (46) birds yearly.       If my math is correct, the Zimmerman family pet cats  collectively killed between fifty-five (55) to one thousand-eight  hundred and seventy (1870) birds during their total life span.  I  cannot imagine the carnage that our neighbor’s eleven cats must  have totaled.  They had so many cats, Mr. Wilson began to  name them after the vet bill.  It was not unusual for us to hear,  “Come here three hundred-fifty dollars”.  One must remember  that in Raton, and in the time frame I grew up, the most  important numbers cited in the Raton Range were how many  people attended the race track daily, and how many hunters  were shot and killed by “friendly fire” during hunting season.   No research studies were cited on yearly bird deaths.         The American Bird Conservancy president George Fenwick,  reports that the recent findings should pose “a wake-up call for  cat owners and communities to get serious about this problem  before even more ecological damage occurs.”  Fenwick  continued, “The very high credibility of this study should  finally put to rest the misguided notions that outdoor cats  represent some harmless, new component to the natural  environment. The carnage that outdoor cats inflict is staggering  and can no longer be ignored or dismissed.”       Sandia Heights is situated in one of the most beautiful high  desert communities filled with an abundance of exotic birds and  wildlife that are being endangered by simple actions that can be  reversed.  I was given this “wake-up call” by one of our  neighbor’s, Ed and Virginia Fultz.              Continued on page 3  3   The GRIT – April 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 4                                                                                                    Continued from page 2         They shared with me an article written by  Juliet Eilperin, a journalist for The  Washington Post.  They also gave me a  needed history lesson on the environmental  and ecological changes that have occurred in  our immediate surroundings of Tramway  Terrace Loop over the last twenty-seven  (27) years.       Ed and Virginia talked compassionately  about the birds and wildlife that have  disappeared over their twenty-seven years of  living on Tramway Terrace Loop.  The first  birds that vanished from their beautiful  setting were the yellow breasted Western  Meadowlark.  The second species quietly  disappearing from our surroundings were  the Gambel Quails, not to be mistaken with  the Scaled Quail, which over the years; its  population has been dramatically reduced.   Ed and Virginia talked about the Scaled  Quails being in the hundreds, and now we  are lucky to see three or four coveys. On  their first adventure in their new world, the  covey would number ten or twelve.  Several  days later, the coveys are reduced to five or  six, and after the first week maybe there are  three baby quails. In spring of 2012, after  four years of living in Sandia heights, I  noticed how the numbers had decreased.   The next specie that left and did not return  was the Towhees. This is a tiny little bird,  but sorely missed. Ed Fultz indicated that  even the Roadrunners are rarely seen.       This conversation then moved to the  mammalian population. The cottontail rabbit  has been severely diminished over the years,  as have the chipmunks and squirrel  population.  According to Ed and Virginia  they used to have a large population of the  New Mexico Collared Lizards living in their  backyard. These lizards abruptly  disappeared one year, and have never been  seen since their departure.       There are of course many reasons that  could account for these losses, but after  reading the numerous published research  articles and publications, it is my belief that  one of the major contributors to these events  is the pet and feral cat population.  Tramway  Terrace Loop at one time had at least seven  (7) pet cats roaming freely and doing what  cats do best, catching and killing their prey.       Peter Marra said “These are things that  are reversible once we understand them.   That’s the important thing here.”  I know  that I will become more aware of what I as a  pet owner can do to prevent the loss of our  natural environment in one of the most  beautiful places one can live.       Covenant Support Committee:         The summer rains are not far off and the  spring landscaping and building season is  here.  We often do not consider managing  drainage of water (when it rains) either from  our roof or lot.  Flow patterns can be  disturbed when new septic systems are  installed, walls built, trees planted, or the lot  is re contoured.  The new flow path is  sometimes directed to a neighbor causing  erosion and or damage to property.  Please  understand that is the responsibility of the  homeowner to be sure that runoff water is  not or will not cause a problem (nuisance)  for your neighbors.         Most all of the lots in Sandia Heights  have a Grading and Drainage Plan on file at  the Bernco Public Works Department.  They  will assist you in locating your plan. Contact  information: 2400 Broadway SE, Building  N, Abq, NM 87102. Tel: 848-1500, Email:  publicworks@bernco.gov.  Do not rely on  the person you hire to do the work to be  aware of the drainage plan. It is up to you to  assess if the work being done will disturb  the grading and effect drainage.  Remember,  it is a lot cheaper to do the job correctly  rather than having to redo it to correct  problems.       4   The GRIT – April 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 4                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:   Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

Yes, a burglar will look for newspapers in the driveway and UPS or FEDEX  deliveries on your front porch; both are dead giveaways that no one is home.  Call Sandia Heights Security when you are going out of town (even if it’s just  overnight). Many burglars will leave a pizza flyer or window cleaning ad on  your door just to see how long it takes for you to remove it. Have a neighbor  keep an eye out for those things too.   2. Carry your car keys with you in your hand when walking to and from your car, having this  readymade alarm system in your hand ready at a moment’s notice can be invaluable.        Trash and Recycle Bins   It seems that many residents are now leaving their bins either on the roadside or next to their homes  where they are visible to neighbors and passersby. We would like to remind everyone that improper  storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia Heights Covenants which state in general:     “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said containers to be concealed from public view . . .  “   Please, when your trash and recyclables have been collected, return your bins to storage out of  public view.     We would like to remind all residents that trash (including recycling) must be out no later  than 7am on the scheduled pickup day, or no earlier than 5pm on the evening prior to  collection.

White Roofs in Sandia Heights  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC         Since the original publication of this  article in January of 2010, the ACC has  received many requests for the installation  of roof coatings using relatively new  materials known as “cool roof” materials  that, when installed, significantly reduce the  amount of energy needed to cool a home.   Most of these materials are available in  several colors including white and various  shades of tan.  The difference in the overall  energy savings of a white material compared  to most of the tan materials is relatively  insignificant--about four to five percent (the  white material, of course, is slightly more  energy efficient).       Many of the individual unit covenants in  Sandia Heights specifically prohibit the use  of white roofing materials.  In response to  the demand for these energy-saving  materials and the overall benefits to the  homeowner (and to our environment) in  terms of reduced utility costs, the ACC  agreed that a strict interpretation of the  covenants regarding the use of white roofing  materials needed some “common sense”  adjustments.  These adjustments were  reflected in a revision of the “ACC Design  Guideline for Roofing” published in  December 2009.  The following is an  abbreviated summary of some of the key  points discussed in the revised guideline:       1. The use of white roofing materials will  be approved by the ACC if the roof is not  visible from nearby residences or from local  streets.  Keep in mind that since Sandia  Heights slopes primarily downward from  east to west, “nearby residences” may be  more than just a few homes surrounding the  residence wanting to use the white material  and may extend a considerable distance  (maybe several blocks or so) in the uphill  direction.    Continued on page 8    8   The GRIT – April 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 4                                                                                                      Continued from page 7         The point here is that the ACC wants to  ensure that the high solar reflectivity of the  white roofing material does not have a negative  impact on neighboring properties.  Nobody  wants to look at a bright, white roof!   Even  though the flat portion of the roof may not be  visible from neighboring properties, the insides  and tops of the parapets are often visible. As  such, the ACC is now insisting that these  surfaces be covered with a tan material to  ensure that no white surfaces are visible. If the  ACC determines that a negative impact will be  created by using white material on the flat  portion of the roof, the use of a tan alternative  having a lower solar reflectance value  (nominally, 65 or less) will be acceptable.   Remember that the loss of energy efficiency is  only a few percent by using the tan instead of  the white material.       2.  The other part of the roof material  equation is what is called the “gloss factor”.   Gloss is a measure of the degree to which a  surface functions like a mirror.  Roofing  materials with high gloss finishes have the  potential to reflect nuisance levels of light onto  nearby properties.  Again, as with color,  nobody wants to look at a bright roof with a  mirror-like finish!  Gloss scales range from 20  or less for matte, eggshell, and velvet flat  surface finishes to greater than 85 for high  gloss surfaces such as smooth metal materials.   The ACC will not approve a high gloss finish  for a roofing material (unless, of course,  nobody can see the roof) and encourages the  use of materials with gloss factors of 20 or less.       Please refer to the “ACC Design Guideline  for Roofing” for a more detailed discussion of  this subject.  This document is available on the  SHHA website and at the SHHA office.  When  applying for a roof using these “cool roof”  materials, it would be appreciated if you could  obtain a small color sample of the material  along with the manufacturer’s specifications  that discuss the solar reflectance and specular  gloss characteristics of the material.      ACC Activity Log:  Summary of  Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:   254 Spring Creek Place – Window  Replacement  306 Big Horn Ridge Place – Replace Fence  406 Live Oak Loop – Landscaping, AC unit  Replacement and Play Set  427 Live Oak Lane – Patio Remodel  750 Tramway Lane – New Construction  Preliminary Plans  1059 Red Oaks Loop – Replace Doors  1101 San Rafael – Replace Concrete Patio Pad  1111 San Rafael – HVAC Installation  1163 Laurel Loop – Re-Stucco, Replace  Garage Doors and Windows  1840 Tramway Terrace Loop- Replace Garage  Door and Paint Trim  2037 Quail Run Drive – Evaporative Cooler  Replacement  2733 Tramway Circle - Reroof  9105 Lynx Loop – Window/Door Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.        Covenant  Support Committee:              Spring is the time for flowers to bloom and  campers, boats, and RV's to return to your yard.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity We are in our eighth year of our  Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” couples dining activity. We meet bimonthly in small groups in the  homes of our members. Each small group consists, typically, of three couples plus a host couple,  with each couple contributing to some part of the dinner menu. By “couple”, we mean any twosome  that makes sense.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Our 2012-2013  season is in full swing.
