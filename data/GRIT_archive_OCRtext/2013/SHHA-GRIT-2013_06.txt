Viewing  the online version is free. The printed mailed  GRIT costs SHHA members over $15,000 per  year and lots of trees! You can sign up to receive  email alerts and you will receive a notification,  including the link, when the online version of  the GRIT is available for viewing. The aim is to  have members consider receiving the GRIT  electronically instead of the printed version. The  advantages, besides saving trees and reducing  mailing and printing costs, are quite attractive:  the electronic version is in color and has useful  internet links to passive and dynamic internet  pages. For example, we can, in the future,  include video and PowerPoint presentations of  events of interest to SH residents. Also, the on- line version is higher resolution. If you do  decide to sign up for the online GRIT you will  also receive email alerts regarding any activity  in the Sandia Heights area that might affect you,  such as a wildlife alert or a security issue. To  sign up either email our office at  sandiaheights@comcast.net or call 797-7793.

This amendment changes the date of the annual  meeting from the second Saturday in June to a Saturday in  February by striking out “the second Saturday in June” and  inserting “a Saturday in February.”  Rationale: To coincide with SHHA’s fiscal year.   Pros:  Fewer residents will be on vacation in February than in  June. Cons: None are known. We will vote on it at the annual  meeting scheduled for Saturday, June 8, 2013. If you have  any questions regarding the proposed amendment please contact  the office.      Officer Election Results: The following is the slate of officers  elected for the 2013-2014 operational year:  Ann Zimmerman, President  Joe Pappe, Vice President  George Connor, Secretary  Ann Marie Caffrey, Treasurer    The following returning board member candidate for a second  3-year term will be ratified at the Annual Meeting:   George Connor – Secretary and Chairman of the Parks & Safety         Tram Passes:  SHHA has purchased 8 corporate tram  passes per day!

These concerns include  vehicle speeding, vehicle parking which  blocks road access, bicycle and skateboard  speeding, children playing in our streets,  blind spots on our narrow county roads,  concerns about deer and vehicle collisions,  and lack of vehicle and pedestrian safety  signage in our neighborhood. We have tried  to check into each specific request and get  back to the individuals about them. Here is  some information about this subject that  may be of interest to Sandia Heights  residents.        Vehicle speeding has been and will continue  to be an issue. The County has posted speed  limit signs, put in speed humps (some  people like this and some don’t) and  continues to be the responsible for  enforcement. Vehicle parking that blocks  our narrow roads is in violation of County  ordinances.  Speeding or parking violations  should be reported directly to the BC  Sherriff (non-emergency number, 798- 7000).  In those cases where you believe a  County road is being blocked by parked  vehicles such that a fire or emergency  vehicle couldn’t get by,  no matter whether  the parked vehicles are on one or both sides  of a road, call the Sheriff. A Sheriff's deputy  will respond and handle the situation:    1)  by giving a warning, or    2)  by giving a ticket, or    3)  by having the vehicle(s) towed, if  necessary.      Bicycles and skateboarders are with us in  Sandia Heights. Many bicyclists use  Tramway Blvd.  and the Tramway  pedestrian path, while others use our narrow  roads. We ask all residents to be watchful,  cars for bicyclists, bicyclists for cars, and  both for pedestrians. Just remember that the  visual image of a bicycle or a pedestrian is  much smaller than that of a car or SUV.  Also, neighborhood speed limits apply to  both cars & bicycles. Skateboarding on our  County roads is allowed ONLY if the  skateboarders comply with the same rules as  pedestrians (an interesting twist I didn’t  know until I read Traffic Ordinance 82-1  and got an interpretation of it from a BC  Deputy). There is one skateboarding park  nearby; it is the North Domingo Baca Skate  Park on Wyoming two blocks north of Paseo  Del Norte.     There are more children playing in our  neighborhood as the weather warms. Please  be watchful for pedestrians of all ages as we  drive around and through Sandia Heights.      We have many signs in and around Sandia  Heights. In general, these signs are of an  informational or regulatory nature. Most of  the signs along the roads are on County  property/easements. They are placed there  pursuant to County Ordinances or State or  Federal regulations. There is always a  conflict between already having enough  signs and  needing more signs. Because of  the semi-rural nature of our neighborhood,  and our desire to keep it that way, both your  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  and the County road department strive to  have the right balance of just enough, but  not too much information and safety  signage.       Tips For Cyclists  Even before hitting the road, make sure your  bike and body are well prepared.    Just like a car, your bike needs routine  maintenance. Check your brakes  regularly and keep your tires inflated.  An expert at a local bike shop can even  do a complete tune-up.

The Board of County  Commissioners passed resolutions imposing  fire restrictions on open burning and  fireworks outside the city limits of  Albuquerque, in the unincorporated areas of  Bernalillo County.     The following are some of the fire  restrictions: bonfires, agricultural burning,  burning of explosive, campfires, ceremonial  fires, cooking fires, hot torch burning,  ignition of rocket motors, open burning,  open flames, slash piles and burning weeds.     To obtain the full list please visit the County  website:  www.bernco.gov/Open_Burn_Ban_Informat ion/    While the County has a restrictive ordinance  on open burning for certain materials,  covenants in Sandia Heights prohibit  burning. They generally state: “No trash  shall be burned on the premises except in  approved incinerators located indoors or  within service yard. No garbage shall be  burned. Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed  from public view by an attractive  enclosure. No barbecue or other outdoor  cooking facility  shall be located  thereon nearer  than ten feet from  either side of lot  line unless made a  part of the  residence.”  Check  your covenants.

Again, your local bike shop can  make adjustments to optimize the bike  for you.    Get the right accessories. Mirrors,  reflectors, a bell to alert pedestrians, and,  of course, a helmet. A headlight and  taillight are often required by law when  riding at night.    Your bike is in shape, but are you?  Before taking a long trip, start with  shorter trips and stretch beforehand.    Dress for the part. Wear light, reflective  clothing at night. For longer trips, dress  in layers. A helmet is great, but  preventing a collision in the first place is  even better. Follow these tips to do your  part—we've got tips for motorists below.    Be predictable. Always ride in a straight  line, as far to the right as safely possible,  but remaining visible to drivers. Don't  swerve, and use hand signals if you're  slowing down or turning.    Get personal. Make eye contact with  other drivers (in a non-creepy way) to  ensure that they see you, and they'll give  you more respect on the road.    Watch for hazards. Piles of leaves,  puddles, gravel and other dangers could  make you lose control of your bike. In  the city, watch for manhole covers,  sewer grates and other surfaces that can  become slick.    Obey the law. Since laws vary by state,  make sure you know the rules  beforehand.  Red lights and stop signs  apply to you, too.  Tips For Motorists  Bicycles on the road are,  by law, vehicles with the  same rights as motor  vehicles. It's the  responsibility of both the  rider and driver to share the  road. Here are a few ways to protect those  using pedal power:    Be patient. If the lane is too narrow, if  there's oncoming traffic, or if you don't  have enough visibility to pass...don't.     Reduce your speed when approaching a  bicycle. Even if there's a bike lane, an  opening car door, for example, may  cause the rider to swerve into traffic.    Don't honk. You could startle the rider.  Make eye contact and, if you make a  mistake, everyone loves a courtesy  wave.    Be extra cautious of children. They can  be even more unpredictable and less  aware of the dangers around them.     Construction Courtesy and  Safety in Sandia Heights  By Bob Bower, Chairman ACC    This is the time of year when much of the  heavy outdoor construction efforts  commence here in Sandia Heights.   Although some of the following points are  included in the construction approval letters  sent to the applicant, experience has shown  that a few of these points need additional  emphasis and that other items not included  in the approval letters need to be addressed.   When you have significant construction  efforts underway at your property, please  consider the following points as a matter of  courtesy to your neighbors and for the safety  of the community:    1.   Please limit all noisy work to the hours  between 8 AM and 6 PM, Mondays  through Saturdays and try not to  schedule exterior work on Sundays.  2.  Control your construction trash by using  appropriate trash containers so our local  winds don’t scatter the trash outside the  borders of your property.     Continued on page 8    8   The GRIT – June 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 6                                                                                                      Continued from page 7  2. Make sure that the containers are  periodically emptied and, if possible, not  placed in the street.  3.   Make sure your contractors provide  receptacles for the safe disposal of smoking  materials such as cigarettes. This summer  may be the driest in many years and we  don’t need wildfires caused by the careless  discarding of cigarettes at a construction  site.  Please pay extra attention to this item!  4.  Don’t allow your contractors to dump used  concrete, stucco “swill”, or other  construction materials on empty lots or  down street gutters, into storm drains, or on  AMAFCA or County-controlled properties  such as water diversion channels.  If this  happens, you may get stuck with cleanup  costs.  5.   Please don’t allow your contractors to  create on-street traffic problems by parking  too many vehicles on the sides of our  narrow roads.  6.   Ask your contractors to limit the use of  radios and boom boxes that create  excessive amplified music at the  construction site.  7.   Make sure that your contractors maintain  proper sanitary facilities on site for use by  workers at all times.    Remember to stay involved with your  construction effort.  If you see issues such as  those listed above, take action to correct any  situation that you feel may create a safety issue  to the community or be an annoyance to your  neighbors.       ACC Activity Log: Summary of  Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:   6 Juniper Hill Road – Window Replacement  44 Rock Ridge Court – Landscaping  53 Rock Point Place – Paint House Fascia &  Garage Door  99 Juniper Hill Road – Re-stucco  305 Big Horn Ridge – Repaint Trim  347 Paintbrush Drive – Re-stucco  370 Big Horn Ridge Road – Door  431 Live Oak Loop – Repaint Trim  440 Live Oak Loop – Landscaping, Deck and  Staircase  514 Black Bear Loop – Reroof  536 Black Bear Road – Deck Enclosure,  Landscaping & Pool  645 Cougar Loop – Landscaping  727-8 Cedar Hill Lane- Garage Door  Replacement  743 Tramway Lane - Fence  810 F Live Oak Road – Shading Device  869A Tramway Lane Court – Patio Cover  Replacement  929 Tramway Lane – Fence Extension  989 Lynx Loop – Driveway Replacement  1065 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  1105 San Rafael Ave. – Deck  1114 San Rafael Ave. – Landscaping  1115 San Rafael Ave. – Walkway & Patio  1418 San Rafael Ave. - Pergola  1512 Eagle Ridge Road – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  1862 Tramway Terrace Loop – Garage Door  Replacement   1907 Quail Run Road – Reroof  2015 Quail Run Drive – Stucco Repair  2027 Quail Run Drive – Repaint Trim  2033 Quail Run Drive – Replace Cedar House  Fascia  2414 Tramway Terrace Court – Repair & Paint  Wall  2452 Tramway Terrace Court – Retaining Wall  2722 Tramway Circle – Garage Door  Replacement  2813 Tramway Circle – Fence Replacement  2815 Tramway Circle – Reroof  2828 Tramway Circle – Deck  7738 Cedar Canyon Road – Photovoltaic  Panels  7740 Cedar Canyon Road – Replace Windows  and Swamp Cooler  12609 Carmel Court – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  12625 Carmel Court – Resurface Driveway  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management. Moving.

We  meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our members. Each small group consists,  typically, of three couples plus a host couple, with each couple contributing to some part of the  dinner menu. By “couple”, we mean any twosome that makes sense.  The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. We’re always looking for new couples to join us, so if this  sounds like an activity that might appeal to you, please call or e-mail Paula Knarr for more  information- 821-3444 or kpknarr@comcast.net                    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  2-B San Rafael Ave NE  Albuquerque, NM 87122                                                                SHHA ANNUAL MEETING FOR SHHA MEMBERS  At the Church of the Good Shepherd  7834 Tennyson  9 AM – 11:30 AM  Saturday, June 8, 2013  Doors open at 8:30 a.m. Refreshments available
