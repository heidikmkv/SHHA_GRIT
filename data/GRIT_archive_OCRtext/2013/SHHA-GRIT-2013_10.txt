Because of that there are  three Bylaws amendments that need to be voted  on. Therefore, SHHA is holding a Special  Meeting of the SHHA Membership at 10am on  Saturday, November 9 at the Church of the  Good Shepherd solely for the purpose of voting  on these proposed amendments. Doors will open  at 9:30am. The proposed amendments to the  bylaws are on the SHHA website:  sandiahomeowners.org. The first three  amendments are being made because of the  annual meeting date change which was approved  at the June 2013 annual meeting. A fourth  amendment has been added to decrease the  minimum requirement of Board members on the  Board from fourteen to eleven. If you have  any questions regarding the proposed  amendments please contact the office.         Communications and Publications  Committee  By Anderson Kressy       The GRIT is a publication of Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association, a non-profit  organization that represents the interests of all  Sandia Heights residents.

This was  before school started.         After school started, we heard from a mother  whose daughter was run into by a car, hitting her  arm with the car mirror. This was at slow speed,  and no one was injured thank goodness.  The  man did stop and made sure the girl was OK and  said he was sorry. These kinds of incidents in  our neighborhood will be even more problematic  as days become shorter.  So please let’s be  extra careful of youngsters at school bus stops  and if they are walking or at play near our  roads.                What do skeletons say before they begin  dining?

In response to these complaints,  the SHHA’s Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) is charged with the responsibility of  assuring that all owners of property in  Sandia Heights adhere to the provisions of  the covenants applicable to the particular  Unit where the property is located.  There  are about 40 different Units within the  Sandia Heights community, and no two sets  of covenants are exactly the same. This  diversity in our covenants makes  community-wide enforcement difficult at  best. In addition, the CSC does not have the  volunteer manpower to patrol throughout  Sandia Heights looking for covenant  violations. As such, the CSC has developed  procedures that depend on members of the  SHHA to report covenant violations.       Who can report a violation? First of all,  you must be a property owner in Sandia  Heights and be a member of SHHA in order  to submit a covenant violation form. This  form (Report of Suspected Covenant  Violation) is available at the SHHA office  and from the SHHA website. Your  anonymity as the complainant will be  shielded unless future court action requires  that your identity be revealed. Historically,  court actions of this nature are very rare.   Any SHHA member may submit a covenant  violation form, however, the CSC normally  will act on submissions from residents in the  same Unit where the violation exists, in an  adjacent Unit, or in direct line of sight of the  violation regardless of the Unit you reside  in. The CSC will exercise its discretion as to  whether or not to act on violations outside of  the normal guidelines.       What information is needed on the  violation form? Information regarding you  as the complainant is on the form since the  CSC may want to contact you for additional  details related to your complaint. The  specific violation and its location need to be  identified, along with the rationale  supporting your belief that a violation has  occurred. It also helps to identify the  specific paragraph in the applicable Unit  covenants that you think is being violated.   The form asks if you have contacted the  violator, but this contact is not a requirement  in order to submit the form. The CSC is very  sensitive about not creating an adversarial  relationship between the complainant and  the violator. You may choose to talk to your  neighbor to try to resolve the violation first,  but as stated previously, the CSC does not  require this one-on-one contact. The  last  item required is your signature on the form.   The SHHA staff will recognize electronic  signatures that include the member’s e-mail  address. The CSC will not respond to  complaints submitted by phone calls, notes,  or anonymously.       How does the CSC handle the  complaint? A member of the CSC will be  assigned to investigate the complaint and to  try to resolve it. The member first assesses  the validity of the complaint by verifying the  information submitted on the violation form.  If the complaint is deemed invalid the  complainant will be notified by mail and the  file will be closed.  If it is clear that a valid  violation exists, the member will contact the  alleged violator either in person, by phone,  or by mail and complete an investigative  report. The violator will receive written  notification from the CSC regarding the  specific violation and will be given a  reasonable deadline by which to remedy it.  The member will follow up with the violator  to ensure that the violation is corrected in  accordance with the stated timeline. If the  violation is successfully resolved at this  point, both parties will be notified by mail  and the file will be closed.

Cal  2 Speeding Vehicle  Total Calls  409     SECURITY TIPS:      If you have a safe for valuables, secure it to the floor. A burglar won’t  spend the time to try to break into a safe; though he will take it with  him and worry about opening it later if it is not secured.   If you don’t have an alarm system in your home, leave your car keys  next to your bed within easy reach. If you hear someone trying to break  in, hit the panic button on your car keys. Most have the range to reach your vehicle and the  alarm will go off, and continue to do so until you turn it off or your battery dies.   Be aware of someone knocking on your door or ringing your doorbell during the day.   Chances are it could be a burglar checking to see if you are home or not. Always  acknowledge the knock or ring. You can yell through the door letting them know you are  home. Try to get a description and call 242-2677(COPS) with it so a unit can check the area.  NEVER ignore it! If they think no one is at home, they will break in and now you could be  confronting burglars with you still at home.   Please lock your car if it sits outside. Believe it or not, most auto burglaries are done by the  thief simply opening the car door. That’s why they troll the neighborhoods trying door  handles looking for the ones left unlocked. Don’t leave the garage remote in the car either. If  they get it, they can get inside your home through the garage door.     Remember this little saying; “If you want to find something of value in your car in the  morning, don’t leave it in the car overnight!”   YOUR HOME SOLD, GUARANTEED:  Elite Asset Management Team Pete Veres. is an cove, cus  Inept &Pesinaim..

If the second letter is unsuccessful in solving  the violation, the file will be turned over to  the SHHA attorney for further action. Don’t  put yourself in this latter position by  disregarding these letters—it’s expensive for  both you and the community to pursue legal  action!       Why should you care about covenant  enforcement? Resident surveys conducted  over the years have consistently indicated  that the primary goal of SHHA should be the  enforcement of our covenants. The  covenants were designed to benefit all  property owners in Sandia Heights in order  to preserve and maintain the beauty, quality  of life, and property values in this unique  community. The SHHA and the CSC  actively seek your support for the  enforcement of our covenants. This is your  community and your covenants—take them  seriously!       Preliminary and Final Design  and Construction Plans  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC         The ACC encourages all property owners  of Sandia Heights to submit an application  for preliminary approval of design and  construction plans, particularly for new  construction and major addition projects.   Preliminary plans are the ones that are done  during the initial stages of the planning  process prior to the preparation of final (and  much more expensive) plans.  Review of  plans at the preliminary phase can identify  any problems with governing Unit  covenants or with any of the ACC Design  Guidelines related to the project.  This  “early” review will make it easier to correct  any compliance problems before incurring  further costs as you proceed towards the  preparation of final plans.  As a minimum,  these preliminary plans should contain the  floor plans, elevations, and the location of  the proposed structure on the lot.  It is also  advisable to include exterior materials,  colors, lighting, etc., if known at the time.  The ACC will point out what can and cannot  be approved based on the completeness of  the preliminary plans.  The applicant will be  encouraged to submit additional information  to address any inadequacies with the initial  submission of the preliminary plans in order  to avoid the risk of later disapproval of the  project.  Once the ACC gives its written  approval of the preliminary plans, you can  then proceed with the preparation of final  design and construction plans.  Two copies  of the final plans should accompany the  submittal of another application for final  approval of the project, and these documents  will be used by the ACC to conduct a  neighborhood review of the project, if  needed, prior to the final approval of the  project.  Keep in mind that the ACC only  requires final drawings that show the overall  floor plan, the elevations, the location of the  proposed project on the lot, and any other  features that affect the external appearance  of the residence.  The ACC does not need  drawings showing such items as internal  electrical wiring, etc., that are not related to  what the external appearance of the project  will look like when completed.       Once the ACC approves the final plans,  you must keep the ACC fully informed if  you make any changes to these plans,  regardless of how trivial you may think  these changes are.  Such items as changes to  an exterior chimney design or relocating an  air conditioning unit from a ground-mounted  location to a location on your roof or vice- versa need ACC approval if these changes                                           Continued on page 8    8   The GRIT – October 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 10                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    are not part of the originally approved plans.   Experience has shown that neighbors who have  examined plans made available to them during  a neighborhood review are especially sensitive  to any changes during construction that appear  to differ from the plans that they were invited  to review.       Just for your reference, the ACC currently  has six Design Guidelines for use by property  owners within Sandia Heights to ensure  covenant compliance and to ensure that  property development within the community  does not unduly interfere with the natural  landscape and homeowners’ visual access to it,  and that the resulting construction is in  harmony with the natural surroundings and  residences in the immediate area.         These Design Guidelines are available at the  SHHA office and on the SHHA website.  These  Design Guidelines are listed as follows:   Detached Buildings   Landscaping   Roofing   Setbacks and Variances   Solar Collectors   Walls and Fences       ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   1 Sandia Heights Drive – Landscaping  6 Eagle Nest Court – Re-stucco  150 Whitetail Road – Driveway Replacement  328 Paintbrush Drive – Raise Portion of Roof,  Add Windows, & Re-stucco  346 White Oaks Drive – Re-roof  441 Live Oak Loop – Re-stucco  536 Black Bear Road – Reroof and Window  Replacement  561 Black Bear Road – Re-stucco Parapets  711-30 Tramway Place – Re-stucco and  Repaint Trim  727-1 Cedar Hill Lane – Replace Garage Door  727-19 Tramway Lane – Paint Garage Door  and Trim  749 Tramway Lane – Re-stucco and Parapet  Repair  760-12 Tramway Lane – Reroof  902 Tramway Lane – Wall  1188 Laurel Loop – Driveway   1202 Marigold Drive – Stucco Repair  1234 Goldenrod Drive – Reroof  1241 Rockrose Road - Landscaping   1467 Morning Glory – Reroof & Re-stucco  1803 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace  Heating Unit  1905 Quail Run Drive - Landscaping  1911 Quail Run Drive – Re-stucco  2037 Quail Run Drive – Replace Wooden  Fence  2435, 2437, 2440, 2441, 2442, 2443, and 2444  Tramway Terrace Court – Wall Repair and Re- stucco  2436 Tramway Terrace Court – Repair and  Paint Stucco Wall  2734 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  7737 Cedar Canyon Road – Photovoltaic  Panels  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.
