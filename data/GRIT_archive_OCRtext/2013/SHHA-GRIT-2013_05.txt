This amendment  changes the date of the annual meeting from  the second Saturday in June to a Saturday in  February by striking out “the second Saturday  in June” and inserting “a Saturday in  February.”  Rationale: To coincide with SHHA’s fiscal  year.   Pros:  Fewer residents will be on vacation in  February than in June. Cons: None are known.  We will vote on it at the annual meeting  scheduled for Saturday, June 8, 2013. If you  have any questions regarding the proposed  amendment please contact the office.      Officer Election Results: The following is the  slate of officers elected for the 2013-2014  operational year:  Ann Zimmerman, President  Joe Pappe, Vice President  George Connor, Secretary  Ann Marie Caffrey, Treasurer    The following returning board member  candidate for a second 3-year term will be  voted on at the Annual Meeting:   George Connor         President’s Message   ~ Ann Zimmerman    Names have been changed to protect the  innocent or guilty.

Some of the responding  homeowners requested a summary of the  survey results as outlined herein.       It should be emphasized that the  mentioning of any company’s name does not  mean that SHHA or the WWSSC endorses,  approves or disapproves the services  provided by these companies.       A total of 87 responses were received.   Four companies were mentioned by name  that provides septic tank pumping in Sandia  Heights (listed in order of utilization, most  often to least): Atlas Pumping Service; AAA  Pumping; American Pumping Service;  ASTC, Inc.       Most homeowners have their septic tanks  pumped every three to five years. This  frequency agrees with the EPA  recommendations. About 50% of the  respondents were satisfied with the service  received, 40% were neutral, and 10% had  some serious issues with the quality of  service the company provided.  The pumping company provided the  inspection and certification of the septic  system as stated by 60% of the respondents.  The staff of the Bernalillo County  Environmental Health Department, which is  responsible for waste water management,  regulates the use of septic tanks and leach  fields in the County, and certifies these  systems, was involved in less than 1% of the  inspections. The County was only involved  when specifically requested by the  homeowner.       The requirement for a new system after  inspection was stated by 10% of the  responding homeowners. This requirement  for a new installation was entirely based on  the results after inspection by the servicing  company. All installations of new systems  were done by Rio Grande Pumping Service  on recommendation from the pumping  company. In most cases an advanced system  (with a yearly maintenance contract) was  required. The requirement for an advanced  system did not correlate with acreage (more  or less than 0.75 acre) or usage (water  consumption of more or less than 300 gallon  per household per day).       There are a few results of this survey  worth mentioning:   - Homeowners in Sandia Heights are taking  good care of their systems as shown by the      frequency of servicing or pumping of their  systems. Therefore, contamination of ground  water seems unlikely.  - The inspection of the septic systems seems  to be entirely done by the servicing  company which then recommends  replacement of the system and recommends  one construction company to do the work.  - If a system needs to be replaced most  homeowners are required to install an  advanced system and to purchase a yearly  maintenance agreement.  - The requirement for a primary or an  advanced system as a replacement for a  failed system is not based on lot size or  usage, as specified by the County Waste  Water Ordinance, but on recommendation  by the pumping and/or construction  company.       The Waste Water and Septic System  Committee appreciates the participation of  the homeowners in this survey.         4   The GRIT – May 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 5                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

For more details read the US Environment  Protection Agency’s A Homeowner’s Guide to Septic Systems.   Spread out laundry loads during the week - don’t do all the laundry on the same day.   Minimize the amount of the household cleaners you send down the drain, and use less toxic  products.   Don’t use the garbage disposal.   Use the proper type bathroom tissue. Septic-friendly tissue disintegrates quickly in water into  many small fragments.   Don’t flush anything down the toilet except septic-friendly bathroom tissue and human  waste.

The mail  set there for a couple of hours with the  mystery letter on top of the pile.   Ed came  home from an ACC meeting, and then my  friend Anna stopped by to share a cup of  coffee.   The three of us were standing  around the counter chatting, and having a  few laughs, when I decided to open the  Huntsville letter, proclaiming “I do not  know anyone named David Lyle Piers, and  certainly don’t know anyone living in  Huntsville, Texas.”  Ed and I had lived in  Dallas for eight long years that I always  referred to as “my prison sentence.” I had  driven through Huntsville numerous times,  but to my knowledge did not know anyone  that lived there.    Ana and Ed then began to tease and prod me  to open the letter.  “Oh Ann, this a letter  from that friend of yours that has had a sex  change, and wants to come and visit you in  the Land of Enchantment.”  We all laughed,  and the fun was just beginning.    With my letter opener, I made a clean cut on  the envelope and carefully removed the  letter.  I announced that we were going to  have a read-a-loud.  I interrupted my reading  several times in the first two paragraphs  emphatically stating, “I don’t know this  person.  His letter is not meant for me!”  Accompanied by Ana and Ed’s, “Oh, yeah,  yeah, yeah---.”    Finally by the fourth paragraph, it became  quite clear that I was not the sweetheart  David was searching for when he and she  were sixteen (16) years old.  I continue my  read -a – loud, “Why haven’t you reached  out to me?  I am not the sixteen (16) year  old you use to know and nor are you.  I will  search for you until the end of time.”  I once  again let my audience know that I am  positive that I do not know this man.  He  definitely has the wrong Ann Zimmerman!”  David continues explaining in his own  words, “I’ve been in prison for fifteen (15)  years for a crime I hardly committed.  If I  actually deserved eighteen (18) years, I  would have no qualms about it, but it’s  TEXAS injustice at its best! Let’s put him  away.  He’s no good.  It’s not right there are  people here who have actually done nothing  at all.  I can’t complain I did do something.”    David closed with, “I love you Anna Marie  Zimmerman, you are my sweetheart, you  will always be my sweetheart.”    The three of us, Ed, Ana and I just looked at  one another.  Ed responds with “How sad is  this.  Are you going to answer this guy?”  Ana is definite, “No, Ann, you should not  answer this letter, put it in an envelope, and  mail it back with a brief note that you are  not Anna Michelle Marie Zimmerman.  End  of story!”    I have two more sentences to complete my  read-a-long.      “P.S.  I’ll be a free man next year as long as  I stay out of trouble.  I’m getting older, even  at thirty-four (34), and I feel like forty (40).”  This letter sat on my desk- top for four  weeks, and one morning I decided that  David did deserve to know that I was not the  sweetheart he was searching for.  I wrote  him an up-beat letter from a young almost  seventy (70) year old, trying to give him  hope for the future.  I told him that Ed and I  had not married until we were in our middle  thirties.  I also told him to be very realistic  about his first love Anna Marie Zimmerman.

I put his original letter in with my response  and sent it on it way.  I slapped my hands  together, feeling good that Mr. Piers was  setting a new course for his future.                                  Stay tuned for the rest of the story.       KEEP  BEARS  WILD     Bears started  coming out of  hibernation in  late March, and  now, in May,  they are  ranging farther afield to find food.   Remember, they didn’t eat all winter, and  they’re hungry!   It’s time to start modifying  our behavior for bear season.  We want to  keep our dwindling population of bears in  the Sandias wild, and the only way to assure  they stay wild is by not having anything on  our property that would attract them.  This  means keeping garbage in the garage and  not putting it out until the morning of trash  pickup, bringing bird feeders inside at night  (or stop feeding the birds during the time  bears are active, usually April through mid- November), and storing pet food and extra  bird seed inside the house or garage.  If you  do see a bear, leave it alone. If there’s  nothing on your property to attract them,  they won’t stick around. NM Game and Fish  has issued instructions that we should call  them ONLY if a bear is trying to get into our  house or appears aggressive.  Bears are an  important part of our ecosystem, and it  would be a shame if they disappeared from  the Sandias.  Only people can prevent bear  problems--please do your part to keep our  bears safe!         Announcements & Notices:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am –  4pm.    Office Closed: Monday, May 27  Memorial Day   Happy Mother’s Day – May 12   SHHA Board Meeting – Wednesday,  May 8 at 7pm in the SHHA Office.   Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes,  email alerts and contractor evaluation  binder free to members.   Safety Vests for sale in  the SHHA office. $2 per  vest for members.    SHHA membership  cards: do not forget to go to the website  to get a full listing of the companies that  offer a discount!        Thank you to all who volunteered and  attended the SHHA 3rd Annual Easter Egg  Hunt at the W.

There are about 40 different Units within the  Sandia Heights community, and no two sets  of covenants are exactly the same. This  diversity in our covenants makes  community-wide enforcement difficult at  best. In addition, the CSC does not have the  volunteer manpower to patrol throughout  Sandia Heights looking for covenant  violations. As such, the CSC has developed  procedures that depend on members of the  SHHA to report covenant violations.       Who can report a violation? First of all,  you must be a property owner in Sandia  Heights and be a member of SHHA in order  to submit a covenant violation form. This  form (Report of Suspected Covenant  Violation) is available at the SHHA office  and from the SHHA website. Your  anonymity as the complainant will be  shielded unless future court action requires  that your identity be revealed. Historically,  court actions of this nature are very rare.    Any SHHA member may submit a covenant  violation form, however, the CSC normally  will act on submissions from residents in the  same Unit where the violation exists, in an  adjacent Unit, or in direct line of sight of the  violation regardless of the Unit you reside  in. The CSC will exercise its discretion as to  whether or not to act on violations outside of  the normal guidelines.       What information is needed on the  violation form? Information regarding you  as the complainant is on the form since the  CSC may want to contact you for additional  details related to your complaint. The  specific violation and its location need to be  identified, along with the rationale  supporting your belief that a violation has  occurred. It also helps to identify the  specific paragraph in the applicable Unit  covenants that you think is being violated.   The form asks if you have contacted the  violator, but this contact is not a requirement  in order to submit the form. The CSC is very  sensitive about not creating an adversarial  relationship between the complainant and  the violator. You may choose to talk to your  neighbor to try to resolve the violation first,  but as stated previously, the CSC does not  require this one-on-one contact. The  last  item required is your signature on the form.   The SHHA staff will recognize electronic  signatures that include the member’s e-mail  address. The CSC will not respond to  complaints submitted by phone calls, notes,  or anonymously.       How does the CSC handle the  complaint? A member of the CSC will be  assigned to investigate the complaint and to  try to resolve it. The member first assesses  the validity of the complaint by verifying the  information submitted on the violation form.  If the complaint is deemed invalid the  complainant will be notified by mail and the  file will be closed.  If it is clear that a valid  violation exists, the member will contact the  alleged violator either in person, by phone,  or by mail and complete an investigative  report. The violator will receive written  notification from the CSC regarding the  specific violation and will be given a  reasonable deadline by which to remedy it.  The member will follow up with the violator  to ensure that the violation is corrected in  accordance with the stated timeline. If the  violation is successfully resolved at this  point, both parties will be notified by mail  and the file will be closed.            8   The GRIT – May 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 5                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log:   Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:     31 Juniper Hill Loop – Stucco Wall  338 White Oaks Drive – Re-stucco & Trim  519 Black Bear Road – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  553 Black Bear Road – HVAC replacement  711-31 Tramway Place - Reroof  725-1 Tramway Lane – Addition  804 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  810 F Live Oak Road – Lighting  820 A Live Oak Road – Signage  821-A Live Oak Road – Atrium and Patio  Enclosure  889 Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  1111 San Rafael – Re-stain Deck and Replace  Mailbox  1156 Laurel Loop – Reroof  1161 Laurel Loop – Window Replacement  1170 Laurel Loop – Re-stucco and Roof Repair  1177 Laurel Loop – Landscaping   1411 Bluebell Place – Fence  1481 Morning Glory – New Construction  1556 Eagle Ridge Road – Landscaping  1604 Quailwood – Retaining Wall  2777 Wolfberry Place – Window Replacement   2824 Tramway Circle – Replace Walkway and  Gate  2875 Brushwood Street – Repaint Garage Trim  2882 Tramway Place – Reroof  2895 Tramway Place – Fence Replacement  8218 Raintree Drive – Install Security Doors  9400 Tramway Lane – New Retaining Wall &  Steps   Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.      FIRE SEASON IS HERE AGAIN!  Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC       It appears that the local weather folks are  again predicting a bleak year for moisture and  for a higher-than-normal chance for local  wildfires.  If you haven’t already noticed, the  Sandia Foothills has already had several  wildfires and some of them appear to have been  caused by arsonists.  As a property owner, you  have access to several good sources of  information that recommend measures you can  take to enhance the survivability of your  property in the event of a wildfire on or near  your property. The best source we have found  was published by the New Mexico State  Forestry (NMSF) entitled Creating Wildfire- Defensible Zones and is available at the NMSF  website using the following link:   http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/emnrd/biomass/ docs/Defensible%20Space.pdf.  Copies of this  brochure are also available at the SHHA office.       As I indicated in the articles published  during the last two years on this subject, most  of our unit covenants state that “natural  vegetation is to be left undisturbed where  practical on all lots except for access to  property, clearing of building sites, and  establishment of lawns and flower beds  adjacent to buildings”.         The ACC has published a Design Guideline  for Landscaping which makes the following  points:  1.  Sandia Heights is based on an open space  concept where natural vegetation is of great  importance.  The deed restrictions for the  area require that natural vegetation be left  undisturbed where possible and replenished  after construction is finished.  2. Residents are asked to keep their properties  clear of dead trees and other vegetation  since this material is easily combustible.       The use of the terms “where practical” and  “where possible” gives you, the property  owner, latitude to make wise decisions based  on your perception of the damage to your  property that could occur as a result of a local  wildfire.

In addition, if you feel the  points made in the above-referenced NMSF article make sense for your  particular property, the SHHA and the ACC will not stand in your way if you  feel you want to implement some or all of the article’s recommendations.        SECURITY EMAIL ALERT SYSTEM:        The office has a security email alert system that is available to all SHHA members whose  email addresses are in our database.

We  meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our members. Each small group consists,  typically, of three couples plus a host couple, with each couple contributing to some part of the  dinner menu. By “couple”, we mean any twosome that makes sense.  The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Our 2012-2013 season is in full swing.  The schedule for  the second half of the season is March 9 and May11 in small groups, then a whole group activity  in July as a culminating event for the season.  We’re always looking for new couples to join us,  so if this sounds like an activity that might appeal to you, please call or e-mail Paula Knarr for  more information- 821-3444 or kpknarr@comcast.net.
