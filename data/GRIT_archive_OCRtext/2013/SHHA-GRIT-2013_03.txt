This was a  very optimistic greeting from The New Mexico  Retiree Health Care Authority.       What a welcome. How do they know this will  be a “Year of Wellness? Do they know  something I don’t know?  So the power of  positive thinking began to work, and I decided  that I had better put this volume 24 Number 1 on  the top of the mail to read FIRST.       I began to sort the pile of mail, and in the  same mail delivery was an enticing envelope  with my personal name and address, and a return  address I did not recognize. My first thoughts  were: is this an invitation to a party?  It just said  to me, “OPEN FIRST”. I pushed all the other  mail aside and opened the inviting envelope.   The message was…  WIN A PRE-PAID CREMATION  RETURN THIS COMPLETED CARD TODAY  TO BE ENTERED.  PLEASE INCLUDE  YOUR PHONE NUMBER  SO WE CAN CALL IF YOUR NAME IS  DRAWN.  LAST MONTH’S  WINNER WAS:  NATHAN PENDLETON       These people are certainly brazen.  I just got  a message that this was A Year of Wellness.   Then I began thinking about Nathan Pendleton,  and did he feel lucky to win his pre-paid  cremation? Well I would never be as lucky as  last month’s winner, Nathan Pendleton. In the  October Grit I confessed to all who read the  Grit, I have never won anything but a stale cake  at a cakewalk, and that was 62 years ago.   Would I like to be a winner in this contest? NO,  I would not! I decided at this moment I would  just place plenty of money in an envelope  (keeping in mind inflation) for our executor to  pay for my cremation. A second quick thought  about this morbid subject was should I ask Ed if  he wants to join the cremation envelope? The  good news is that Ed has decided that this  envelope is a great idea, and we should do this  right away, and not ever bring this subject up  again. He does give me a warning about  inflation rate, and we will have to increase the  contents of the envelope on January 1 of every  year. I reply to him, “That is your job in this  death and dying decision.”                                             Continued on page 2  2   The GRIT – March 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 3                                                                                                        Officers  President – Ann Zimmerman  Vice President – Joe Pappe  Secretary – George Connor  Treasurer – Ann Marie  Caffrey  Board Members  Bob Bower  Sharon Evanich  Pete Heinstein  Anderson Kressy  Patrick Lancione  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Ed Stretanski  Sarah Tresouthick  Dick Wavrik    Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator &  Publications &  Communications Editor    SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org    GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit  any submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.   Continued from Front page       After this enlightening experience of dealing with death, I  am now going to find out why 2013 will be A Year of Wellness.  By this time I am really ready for some good news. I read  through the introduction quickly, looking for the “good news.”  The New Mexico Retiree Health Care Authority has partnered  with the state’s health plans to provide us access to vital  information and programs to help each of us to overcome  obstacles to our good health. This article tells me that this is  important because it will make me feel better. It goes on to say  that it is well known that even a little exercise and modest  changes to my diet can have a significant positive impact on  how I will feel. The article then tells me in the long run it will  save me money. Now I am interested! The costs of our health  plans are a direct reflection of how healthy we are as a group.  This is all “good news,” but not any deep secret anyone with a  20-20 IQ shouldn’t know.  This article then concludes,  “Unfortunately, some of those reflections are not what we  would like to see. Most of us are a little overweight, don’t eat an  especially healthy diet, don’t exercise quite enough and too  many of us still smoke.” With the four helpful options stated, I  am 25% closer to good health. I don’t smoke!  I am left  guessing that 25% must be the “good News”.       Well, by now the mail will be here, and maybe there will be  some “good news” for me to reply to. Maybe they are correct in  saying “no news is good news.”                  Covenant  Support Committee (CSC):  Spring is  the time for flowers to bloom and campers, boats, and RV's to  return to your yard. While the CSC is glad to see the new  natural growth, we really do not want the spring and summer  "toys" to sprout. It is against the covenants to park these units  on your property. When you moved into Sandia Heights you  agreed to a set of rules. Even if you are renting, the owner or  property manager should have made you aware of the covenants  (copies are available at the SHHA office) and that you must  abide by them. We ask for your cooperation in keeping the toys  at an off-site parking area (i.e., storage facility). We know this  is inconvenient and most of us like to look out our window and  see our stuff knowing it is just steps away from the weekend  use. Unfortunately the satisfaction of this view is not shared by  your neighbors - resulting in complaints to the CSC. So please  plan ahead and do not bring the prohibited rolling stock into  Sandia Heights for either long term or short term parking.      3   The GRIT – March 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 3                                                                                                    Bylaws Amendment ~ George  Connor, SHHA Secretary       The proposed amendment to the bylaws  is on the SHHA website.

Display  the Sandia Heights Security stickers provided in your security welcome packet.     Trash and Recycle Bins   Last summer brought a change in trash pickup in our Sandia Heights neighborhood. With the change  to large rolling bins for both trash and recyclables came some unintended consequences.      It seems that many residents are now leaving their bins either on the roadside or next to their homes  where they are visible to neighbors and passersby. We would like to remind everyone that improper  storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia Heights Covenants which state in general:     “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said containers to be concealed from public view . . .  “   Please, when your trash and recyclables have been collected, return your bins to storage out of  public view.     We would like to remind all residents that trash (including recycling) must be out no later  than 7am on the scheduled pickup day, or no earlier than 5pm on the evening prior to  collection.  Thanks for helping keep Sandia Heights a beautiful place for all of us to live.  ‘oversrmens orl worsen an endersement by HMA  ‘Sharon and Judson McCallum promote Top VALUES and SALES in ‘Sandia Height!

Unless  you receive permission from the Bernalillo  County Fire Department (BCFD) for this  open fire please do not do it.  The area is too  dry and you are endangering your property  as well as that of the rest of the  neighborhood.  Should you see an open fire  please contact BCFD.  They will tell you if a  permit has been issued, or if open fires are  permissible (this varies from season to  season).  If there is a violation they will send  out the big red truck, put out the fire, and  probably fine the offender.  Remember, even  commercial "fire pits" will give off embers.           News from SHHA Parks  committee regarding recreation  & safety:         With the warmer weather, many SHHA  residents will likely be out walking and  exercising, some with their faithful  companion, Fido. Remember dogs need to  be on a leash. This is required by County  regulation in our two neighborhood parks  where adults and children play.  We have  recently learned that a new off-leash dog  Park was built west of Sandia Heights north  of the Paseo Del Norte & Wyoming  intersection. It is the North Domingo Baca  off-leash dog park located at 7520 Corona  Ave NE, two blocks north of Paseo. This  facility is a large fenced in grassy area  where dogs can run and play to their hearts’  content.       On another subject, if you keep dogs in  your yard here in Sandia Heights, you might  want to look at the Bernalillo County  Ordinance regarding restraint of animals. It  is in the BC Code of Ordinances, Chapter 6 -  Animals and has some excellent and  important information on the subject. One  interesting item to me was regarding electric  or invisible fences. It is in paragraph (e) and  is:   (e)  A person who uses electric or invisible  fencing designed to confine an animal to  their property must clearly post a notice  in two separate locations upon the  property that such a device is in use.  Chapter 6 in its entirety can be found at:  http://www.newmexicoanimallaw.com/docs/ BernalilloCountyAnimalControl.pdf       Be SAFE and enjoy our wonderful  Sandia Heights neighborhood!!     Getting the most out of your  home remodeling projects by Bob  Bower, ACC Chairman.    Before you begin an exterior or interior  remodeling project for your home, consider  some of these issues described below:  1. Depending on the size of the project,  consider hiring a general contractor  (GC).  For large projects such as adding  a garage, another room, or a re-do of an  existing kitchen or bathroom, a qualified  GC can save you a lot of coordination  headaches.  The job of the GC is to  manage all of the various subcontractors  (subs, for short) needed for a remodeling  job.  In essence, the GC runs the show  by coordinating the activities of the  various subs.  Without the oversight of  the GC, there will most likely be a lack  of communication among the various  subs since subs often do not talk with  one another.  For example, new kitchen  plumbing needs to be done prior to  installing the tile backsplash.  The  plumber may have to have the tile work  torn out in order to have access to areas  behind the tile work to complete the  plumbing modifications.  A good GC  will work to prevent these sorts of  problems.                                        Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – March 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 3                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    2. Make sure you talk with the County and get  a building permit, if required. Some small  jobs don’t need a permit but most major  remodels do need one.  In general, your  contractor is responsible for obtaining  proper building permits—the ACC does not  get involved in permits but can ask you for  proof of a permit. If you don’t “build to  code”, you could end up with fees and fines  if the County inspectors determine that you  should have had a permit before starting  your remodeling job. The cost of  subsequent fees and fines could exceed the  cost of the permit.  In addition, remodeling  done without a permit may cause potential  issues when you go to sell your home.  3.  Be careful not to remove a load-bearing  interior wall in order to create, for example,  a “great room” by combining existing  living and dining rooms. A good GC can  determine if there is a risk to your home if  you elect to remove any interior walls.  Weakening your home’s existing support  structures can affect a future decision to add  roof-mounted solar collectors or roof- mounted heating and air conditioning  equipment.  4.  Like I said last month, be sure that the  contractors you select to handle your home  remodeling projects are properly licensed  and insured. Don’t be afraid to ask for   proof of licensing and insurance.  In 2011,  the Better Business Bureau (BBB) received  over 6,000 complaints nationally against  contractors involved in the construction  industry. This figure represents an 11  percent increase over the previous year. The  BBB advises homeowners to get the name  of the insurance carrier and to confirm with  the carrier that the contractor has the  coverage. The BBB further advises reading  reviews about potential contractors online  and then asking contractors for references.   Take the time to speak with references and  ask if you can see the finished product.    I continue to hope that these monthly GRIT  articles are useful to homeowners here in  Sandia Heights and if you have any suggestions  for future articles, please let me know.         ACC Activity Log: Summary of  Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:   15 Sandia Heights Drive – Retaining Wall  Replacement  30 Juniper Hill Loop – Landscaping  577 Black Bear Road – Remodel  725-19 Tramway Vista Drive – Stucco Repair,  Paint Trim & Door Replacement  727-21 Tramway Lane – Photovoltaic System  875 Tramway Lane – Wall  987 Lynx Loop – Reroof  1009 Tramway Lane – Wall and Landscaping  1059 Red Oaks Loop - Landscaping  1105 San Rafael – Driveway Replacement   2877 Brushwood – Fence Replacement &  Skylight Replacement  8251 Raintree Drive - Landscaping  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       Announcements & Notices:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am –  4pm.    SHHA Board Meeting – Wednesday,  March 13 at 7pm in the SHHA Office.   Easter Egg Hunt – Saturday, March 30 at  W.L.

They are solitary, with males and females meeting only for  mating. Kittens are born in the spring and stay with their mother for 9 to 12  months. About twice as large as a domestic house cat, bobcats usually weigh  15-30 pounds when full grown. The bobcat gets its common name from its  short “bobbed” tail, 4 to 7 inches long. Bobcats’ diet includes rabbits, mice, packrats, squirrels,  birds, and sometimes insects.  They rely on their keen eyesight and hearing to locate enemies and  prey, as their sense of smell is not especially acute.  Bobcats hunt by stealth, waiting motionless  and then pouncing.   Bobcats pose no threat to humans, but they have been known to take domestic dogs and cats.  Keep small dogs indoors and watch them carefully when they are out of doors. Cats should  always be kept inside, as they will fall prey to bobcats (and other predators like coyotes, owls,  and hawks) and may also become infected with plague if they catch infected rodents.   If you see a bobcat, there’s no need to call Animal Control or Game and Fish—just enjoy the  sight of this fascinating and beautiful creature. If you would prefer not to have bobcats in your  yard, then you should remove anything that might attract them, like bird baths, water features,  and bird seed. Water is an obvious attractant, but bird seed attracts the animals bobcats eat, and  bobcats go where the food is plentiful. We hope that a better understanding of bobcats will help  Sandia Heights residents happily coexist with them. They are truly amazing and magnificent  members of our wild neighborhood.

We’re always looking for new couples to join us, so if this  sounds like an activity that might appeal to you, please call or e-mail Paula Knarr for more information-  821-3444 or kpknarr@comcast.net  The Sandia Heights Book Club has an opening for a new member. The group meets the  third Wednesday evening of each month, January-November at members' homes. Upcoming book  selections include The Swerve by Stephen Greenblatt, The Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman, and An  Artist of the Floating World by Kazuo Ishiguro.
