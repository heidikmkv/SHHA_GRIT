February has repeatedly  brought life-changing events into my normally  demanding, but not so dramatic existence.  I did not become aware of this phenomenon  until I was in my late thirties.  Once I realized  the significance of this month, I began to  cautiously look into past events that have  charted my future.  The month of February  without a doubt was and is the month that Ann  Zimmerman’s karma chose to make or break her  future.  In February, when I was 21, my high school  sweetheart gave me an engagement ring, which  I, but not my parents, happily accepted.  I was  aware that this decision would probably mean I  would spend my entire life in Raton, teaching  school just as my mother had done.  One year  later, completing my last quarter of college, I  realized that this was not the path I wanted to  take.    In February of 1964, the group of thirteen young  students, that had decided to complete their  degree in three years, were excitedly  interviewing for teaching jobs.  I was the only  one that had a job, and it was definitely not  exciting.  Joan Sakio, one of my closest friends,  was interviewing to teach in Livermore, CA.   She convinced me to interview, and said I might  change my mind.  Both Joni and the interviewer  were very convincing.  That weekend I drove  my MGA to Raton, returned the ring to its  owner, rescinded the teaching contract in Raton,  and never looked back.  I believe that this event  began the cycle of February designing my path  to the future.  In February 1964-age 22- free of all restrictions  of my past, I signed the Livermore contract.  I  really wanted to see the ocean, and what an  adventure the nine of the thirteen girl graduates  from Colorado State College were about to  begin.  One of those graduates, Ann, had only  traveled beyond the two States of N.M. and  Colo.    Livermore was a terrific school system to begin  a teaching career.  The home of a National  Laboratory, supporting the school system that  would help them attract the finest and highest  skilled scientists and their families, to come and  work in their prestigious National Defense  Laboratory.  On a balmy day, in February of 1966, our  second year in Livermore, Joni and I were  shopping in San Francisco.  Joni had run out of  money, so we went into a Bank of America so  Joni could cash a check.  There was a long  waiting line along a gigantic counter, and Joni  spied a brochure announcing the Department of  Defense Overseas Schools were recruiting  teachers for the coming year.  Joni stood reading  the brochure, and then motioned me to the  counter.  “Ann we have got to apply. This is a  once in a lifetime opportunity!”  We instantly  decided that after two years in Livermore, we  were ready to see the World.  The DOD schools  required two previous years of teaching, and so  we knew that we were qualified!  We filled out  the applications, Joni checking her first choice  as Japan, and I marked my first choice as  Germany.  Interviews followed and we both  were awarded our first choices.  The month of  February was beginning to be a game changer.

I returned to the  U.S. to get a second degree.  This was an  easy decision I made in February.  There are of course years that are void of  February game changers.  However,  February has consistently been in the  limelight of my life.  Thirty-six years ago Ed and I married in  February.  Both parents were relieved, and  Mother called him poor Ed until she died.  My most loving and generous Dad died in  February 1993 after a long and enduring  illness.  On a long planned skiing vacation in Alta, in  February, 1995 I had a horrific skiing  accident.  This accident was on the first day,  and I and spent my entire time reading  books by the fire, and licking my wounds.   In February 2010, my life changed  drastically when I was hospitalized for five  days with pulmonary emboli.  No wonder I  was having problems breathing!  The end  result was a rare genetic blood mutation  controlled by “rat poison.”  I am cautious and aware as I approach the  month of February, and the new year, 2013.

Saint Valentine's Day,  commonly known as Valentine's Day, or  the Feast of Saint Valentine, is observed on  February 14 each year. St. Valentine's Day  began as a liturgical celebration of one or  more early Christian saints  named Valentinus. The most  popular martyrology associated with Saint  Valentine was that he was imprisoned for  performing weddings for soldiers who were  forbidden to marry, and for ministering to  Christians, who were persecuted under the  Roman Empire; during his imprisonment, he  is said to have healed the daughter of his  jailer Asterius and before his execution,  according to the legendary account, he  wrote, "from your Valentine" as a farewell  to her. The day's association with romantic  love grew in the circle of Geoffrey  Chaucer in the High Middle Ages, when the  tradition of courtly love flourished. By the  15th century, it had evolved into an occasion  in which lovers expressed their love for each  other by presenting flowers,  offering confectionery, and  sending greeting cards.    4   The GRIT – February 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 2                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:  Please be reminded  that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle collection, and  security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association membership.

However, there are still a few of you who are walking on the wrong side. Remember, if you  cannot make eye contact with oncoming drivers, you are not walking on the correct side of the road.   Also, although wearing a reflective vest is unnecessary during the daylight hours, it becomes very  important near dusk and later in the evening. It is wonderful to see how many of our neighbors are  improving their health by making the effort to walk out of doors a little more! Let’s also work at  making our neighborhood a friendlier place by smiling and waving at our neighbors as they drive by  us. A smile can really brighten your day as well as that of others!  Reminders to hikers and dog walkers:  1. Help keep our county water supply clean and use one of the Sandia Heights doggie waste bag  dispensers & waste disposal stations at one of our neighborhood parks or at Domingo Baca  arroyo.  2. We still have orange reflective vests for sale in the SHHA office at a low price.     Reminders to Drivers:   1. Be extra vigilant when driving our curvy roads,   2. Watch your speed and go no faster than the posted speed limits, and  3. Watch for pedestrians and cyclists on the pedestrian walkway when turning onto or off of  Tramway Blvd.  Contact the SHHA office by email or phone if you have any Park or Safety concerns. We will either  address them or let you know whom to contact at Bernalillo County about your concern. BE SAFE!  and ENJOY our wonderful neighborhood.    YOUR HOME SOLD, GUARANTEE!

Unless you receive  permission from the Bernalillo County Fire  Department (BCFD) for this open fire please  do not do it.  The area is too dry and you are  endangering your property as well as that of  the rest of the neighborhood.  Should you  see an open fire please contact BCFD. They  will tell you if a permit has been issued, or if  open fires are permissible (this varies from  season to season). If there is a violation they  will send out the big red truck, put out the  fire, and probably fine the offender.   Remember, even commercial "fire pits" will  give off embers.  For more information  please visit:  www.bernco.gov/Open_Burn_Ban_Informat ion   Bernalillo  County Open  Burn Ban  Information  The Bernalillo County  Open Burn Advisory  Hotline number is 468-7200 and is now in  English and Spanish. The Board of County  Commissioners passed resolutions imposing  fire restrictions on open burning and  fireworks outside the city limits of  Albuquerque, in the unincorporated areas of  Bernalillo County.     The following are some of the fire  restrictions:  agricultural burning, bonfires, burning of  explosive, campfires, ceremonial fires,  cooking fires, hot torch burning, ignition of  rocket motors, open burning, open flames,  burning slash piles and burning weeds.     To obtain the full list please visit the County  website:  www.bernco.gov/Open_Burn_Ban_Informat ion/    While the County has a restrictive ordinance  on open burning for certain materials,  covenants in Sandia Heights prohibit  burning. They generally state: “No trash  shall be burned on the premises except in  approved incinerators located indoors or  within service yard. No garbage shall be  burned. Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed  from public view by an attractive  enclosure. No barbecue or other outdoor  cooking facility shall be located thereon  nearer than ten feet from either side of lot  line unless made a part of the residence.”   Check your covenants.

If you happen to  encounter a situation such as a broken or  clogged water or sewer line, repair or  replacement of your septic system, a leaky roof,  or any other situation where the urgency of the  issue requires quick action on your part in order  to prevent or minimize property damage, the  ACC does not want to stand in your way. You  do not need to submit any sort of ACC  application form for these types of situations.   Just let the SHHA office know that you will be  tending to an emergency situation and, if  applicable, heavy equipment for excavations  may be required.  The phone number at the  SHHA office is 797-7793.  This information  will help the office answer questions from your  neighbors who may be inquiring about what is  going on at your residence.    Just as a reminder, be careful when selecting a  contractor to handle an emergency repair or for  any other repairs or modifications to your  residence.  In this time of a depressed  economy, there are many individuals looking  for business and some of these folks may not be  properly licensed or insured.  You bear the risk  of poor quality workmanship and a host of  other problems if you choose to use an  unlicensed or uninsured contractor.  I have  included articles in the GRIT on this subject  over the past several years (the last one was in  the July 2012 GRIT) so take some time and  familiarize yourself with just how to make sure  that your contractor is properly licensed and  insured before you “sign on the dotted line”.   Don’t be a victim of an unlicensed or uninsured  contractor!    From all of the members of the ACC, we wish  you a great 2013 and please remember that the  Committee is here to help you in any way we  can through all phases of your home  improvement projects.       SNOW  REMOVAL  Most of the roads  within Sandia  Heights are  County  roads/streets, although there are a few private  roads.
