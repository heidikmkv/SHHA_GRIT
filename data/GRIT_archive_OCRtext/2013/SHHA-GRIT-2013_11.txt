Because of that there are  Bylaws amendments that need to be voted on.  Therefore, SHHA is holding a Special Meeting  of the SHHA Membership at 10am on Saturday,  November 9 at the Church of the Good  Shepherd solely for the purpose of voting on  these proposed amendments. Doors will open at  9:30am. The proposed amendments to the  bylaws are on the SHHA website:  sandiahomeowners.org. The first three  amendments are being made because of the  annual meeting date change which was approved  at the June 2013 annual meeting. A fourth  amendment has been added to decrease the  minimum requirement of Board members on the  Board from fourteen to eleven. If you have  any questions regarding the proposed  amendments please contact the office.           Roadrunner Holiday Food Drive    Be a part of taking action this holiday season  and get involved in our food drive!

All that  is needed is for the property owner to  maintain membership in SHHA. Many  property owners mistakenly believe that if  they move from Sandia Heights and rent  their house to another family, they must  cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!  Membership dues will continue to be  collected as part of the monthly utility bill  for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to  the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible  for all SHHA membership benefits except  voting privileges and filing covenant  violation complaints. Be sure you maintain  your membership so your tenants can  experience some of the great “perks” of  living in Sandia Heights!        On-line GRIT Newsletter & Email  Alerts    The GRIT newsletter is posted on the  SHHA website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.

This is done to   preserve the enjoyment of the night sky  from light pollution. Regardless of the  individual covenants for your Unit, the  entire North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia  Heights fall under the Bernalillo County  Code for light pollution. The code includes,   but is not restricted to security lighting,  street lights, landscape lights, building  mounted area lights, building façade lights.   In general, lights shall remain OFF between  11:00 pm and sunrise; lights on buildings  shall be mounted no higher than 16 feet;  lights must be shielded so the light is  directed perpendicular to the ground.  To see  the entire code and for exceptions, go to the  Bernalillo County Website  (www.bernco.gov) and look under  ordinances, Section 30-186. So, if you leave  your lights on at the entry, garage doors,  house floods, after 11:00 pm and they are  not shielded they may be in violation of the  County Code. While the CSC does not  enforce County ordinances we will work  with folks to make them aware of the  options and try to get resolution. At night,  even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to  enjoy the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city  below.                       DON’T LET YOUR WATER  PIPES FREEZE!  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC    I wanted to get this article out earlier this  year than I did last year.  It’s too early yet to  tell if Albuquerque’s upcoming winter of   2013-2014 will be unusually cold or not but  I think it’s a good time right now to remind  you how to protect your water pipes from  the effects of very cold weather.  Most of the  “local experts” on this subject generally  agree that steps need to be taken to protect  water pipes if temperatures are expected to  drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit.  A  broken water pipe inside your home can  cause a lot of extensive and expensive  damage!    Let’s start with the outside of your home.   Disconnecting water hoses and protecting  outdoor water faucets are very important.   Water that freezes in outdoor hoses  connected to faucets causes a buildup of  pressure on interior plumbing that can result  in a rupture of the interior pipes if the  pressure is too high.  Damage to these  interior pipes near an outdoor water faucet is  often difficult to repair due to the  inaccessibility of these pipes. Disconnecting  hoses from these outdoor faucets and  protecting the faucets with hard foam  insulating cups are good ways to reduce the  chances of damage to these water pipes that  extend through your exterior walls.  These  inexpensive foam cups can be purchased at  most home improvement or hardware stores  and are easy to install.  I’ve also found that  it is wise to wrap the outdoor faucet with  some insulation prior to placing the foam  cup over the faucet, particularly if the faucet  is located on the north side of your home or  is located in an area that does not receive  any winter sunshine.  Also, if you have any  water pipes that are located outside your  home that are exposed to the outside  temperatures, you should consider using  insulating tape or heat tape around these  exposed pipes.    Now, let’s consider the inside of your home.   If Albuquerque experiences a spell of  extremely cold weather where temperatures,  particularly at night, drop to below the 21                                                                               Continued on page 8    8   The GRIT – November 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 11                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    degrees Fahrenheit “benchmark”, leave the  water supply line on at a very slow drip rate  somewhere inside your home.  Water in “slow  motion” is much less likely to freeze than water  that is motionless inside of a pipe.  Normally, a  faucet located far away from where the water  enters your home is the one that you should use  for this purpose.  The cost of water used is  insignificant compared to the cost of repairing  damage caused by a broken water line inside  your home.  Normally, these very cold spells  don’t last too long so leaving an indoor faucet  dripping for a few days and nights should get  you through these spells until warmer  temperatures return.  If you are away from your  home during the cold season, make sure that  there is adequate heat inside your home to  prevent pipes from freezing.  Even when trying  to save energy costs, don’t turn the heat too far  down and don’t turn the heat off altogether  unless you have all of the water lines properly  drained.  Believe me, I have seen the damage  caused by pipes that have not been properly  drained and have subsequently burst inside the  home where the heat has been turned off!      One final note for those of you who have  swamp coolers. If you have not already done  so, be sure to drain the water reservoir and  disconnect and drain the water supply line. It  doesn’t take much of a freeze to damage these  cooler components. Have a great winter!!       ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   200 Spring Creek Drive – Re-stucco  413 Live Oak Loop - Reroof  420 Live Oak Court – Ramada  635 Cougar Loop – Re-stucco  646 Cougar Loop – Re-stucco  883 Tramway Lane – Storage Cabinet  711-31 Tramway Place – Re-stucco and Wall  Repair  727-19 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   753 Tramway Lane – Re-stucco & Paint Trim  935 Bobcat Blvd. – Office Addition  1016 Tramway Lane – Patio Cover  1172 Laurel Loop – Photovoltaic Panels  1183 Laurel Loop – Landscaping  1241 Rockrose Road – Retaining Wall  1423 San Rafael Ave – Stucco Repair  1456 Bluebell Drive – Reroof, Fog Coat and  Paint Trim  1560 Eagle Ridge Road – Swamp Cooler and  Windows Replacement  1606 Quailwood Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  1701 Quail Run Court – Replace Fence  1843 Tramway Terrace Loop – Reroof  1911 Quail Run Road – Replace Sliding Doors  1915 Quail Run Drive – Door Installation  7711 Cedar Canyon Place – Window  Replacement  8224 Raintree Drive – Re-stucco  8237 Raintree Drive – Storage facility  8250 Raintree Drive – Re-stucco  8251 Raintree Drive – Landscaping   8252 Raintree Drive – Refinish Trim  Go to the website:   www.sandiahomeowners.org     to read about all   projects currently   under   ACC management.   MAX SANCHEZ  has been awarded the top honor of being named the 2012 number one  individual Coldwell Banker agent in New Mexico.  ‘ew SandiaHts.com |  | 228-8287 24 YEAR RESIDENT Max Heights  SPECIALIZING IN SANDIA HEIGHTS AND NORTH @y ALBUQUERQUE ACRES FOR OVER 18 YEARS.
