The band’s  repertoire is one third vintage music of old  cowboy trail songs, one third western swing  from the 30s, 40s & 50s, and one third originals.  Syd's timeless melody "Under New Mexico  Skies" was given the honorable title of "Official  Cowboy Song of the State of New Mexico" by  former Governor Bill Richardson.         The New Mexico Music Industry has  presented Syd with awards for "Country Song of  the Year," "Best Vocal Performance," and "Most  Humorous Song."  His 2007 NMMI award for  "Vocalist of the Year" made him the only person  to ever win it twice. Syd has been seen on  television commercials and billboards  throughout the west as spokesman for the  Powerball Lottery Campaign. Listen to his  music on www.sydmasters.com.

We are experiencing one of the worst droughts  in New Mexico history and our treasured  wildlife is in peril. Each of us can help by being  responsible and vigilant in following the Do’s  and Don’ts listed in the article.    Black Bear   Mammals Field Guide to the Sandias  Permission granted by Robert Julyan and Mary  Stuever         Actually, in the Sandia Mountains, as in other  areas in New Mexico, black bears are not often  black. Their color ranges from blond and  cinnamon to brown, dark-chocolate, and liver- colored, depending on the effects of molting,  sun-bleaching, and ambient lighting. Unlike the  grizzly bear, which has been extirpated from  New Mexico, the black bear has a Roman nose,  rounded back, and shorter claws rather than a  dished face, humped back, and long claws    Continued on page 3      Officers  President – Ann Zimmerman  Vice President – Joe Pappe  Secretary – George Connor  Treasurer – Ann Marie  Caffrey  Board Members  Bob Bower  Sharon Evanich  Sarah Holt  Anderson Kressy  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Emily Rudin  Ed Stretanski  Dick Wavrik    Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator &  Publications &  Communications Editor    SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org    GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit  any submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.

This problem has  increased dramatically the last few years because of the prolonged  drought.   Most of us have not remembered to do deep root  watering of our plants on a frequent basis, year round to keep them  from dying.         So what should we do now?  First, start deep root watering any  and all of you living plants.  And second, consider removing any  dead trees and shrubs because they are potential fire hazard.   Articles about recent New Mexico and Colorado wildfires indicate  that removing dead trees and shrubs around residences is very  important in preventing wild fires. If you cannot cut and remove  your dead trees and shrubs, stop by the SHHA office and look at  our references book for landscape contractors & trash haulers.   SHHA residents have had experience with and “evaluated” many  such contractors.  If the dead plants are on County right-of-ways  adjacent to your property, call the County at 848-1503 and put in a  work order to have them removed.       Taking care of your living and dead landscaping this summer  will help maintain your property values and make Sandia Heights  a nicer place in which to live.  2   The GRIT – August 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 8                                                                                                    Continued from front page         Imagine a football lineman sleeping for  five months and then trying to make up for the  rest of the year by eating for seven months,  and one can get a sense of what a bear’s life is  like. A mature boar, or male bear, can tip the  scale at 500 pounds, while a sow, or female  bear, can weigh 400 pounds. A bear’s “diet”,  if you can call it that, is legendary for this  mostly vegetarian member of the order  Carnivora. It starts off in the spring grazing on  grass, then switches to insects when the  anthills, termite mounds, wasp hives, and  rotten logs infested with beetle grubs warm  with the longer day length. With summer, the  bear begins to feed on ripening fruit; look for  various native plant seeds in their scat,  including prickly-bear cactus fruit or tunas,  bear-corn, New Mexico elderberry,  chokecherry, and wild plum. As the summer  passes into fall, look in bear scat for pieces of  acorns from the Gambel, gray, and shrub live  oaks, as well as pinõn fragments. These two  food sources are high in lipids and help bears  store fat to overwinter. Good reproduction the  following year is dependent on the oak or  pinõn crop. The “berries” of the one-seed,  Rocky Mountain, alligator, and common  juniper are an annual staple in their diet since  they produce every year, unlike oaks and  pinõns. When there is a normal or a wet El  Nino year then everything is fine because  bears eat the wild foods.  When there is a dry  La Nina winter and spring, the bears travel  down the mountain and forage in humans’ rich  garbage dumpsters and watered gardens and  orchards. Here they scarf down plums,  peaches, pears, apples, and even pumpkins, as  well as refuse. If they come across a beehive  that is not encircled by a hot wire they might  rip it apart for the honeycomb. Pet food  carelessly left outside also is fair game.  Unclean barbecue grills, birdseed,  hummingbird feeders, and compost piles with  melon rinds and fruit peelings are all too  enticing for bears. The habituated bears learn  to associate food with people and lose their  fear and respect of people. With more and  more housing developments around the  mountains, bear-human encounters have  become so frequent in the Sandia Mountains  that concerned citizens and legislators have  made it a state law to “bear-proof” garbage  containers.          Wildlife officers, mandated to look after  public safety, are forced to trap “offending”  bears and release them in remote wild  locations. One “two strikes and you’re out”  bear was exiled to Mount Taylor, only to  return to the Sandias-a straight-line distance of  sixty-eight miles! Wildlife officials and citizen  groups alike try to educate people regarding  responsible human behavior in bear country.  You can help too by paying attention to the  following:  1. Never feed bears or wildlife either  purposefully or accidentally.  2. Pick apples, other fruit, and berries,  especially those on the ground. Do not  plant fruit trees near homes if you live in  the mountains.  3. Keep garbage in a locked garage or shed  and take it out the morning of pickup.  Put mothballs (poison) in a sock and  hang it near the garbage to disguise the  smell and ward off bears.  4. Don’t feed pets outdoors. Don’t leave  food dishes outside or store pet food  near doorways leading outside.  5. Hang bird feeders between trees or poles  at a height of seven feet off the ground.  6. Bring in hummingbird feeders at night  or hang then high from a wire.  7. Don’t feed suet in spring, summer, or  fall.  8. Store birdseed in a closed container  indoors.  9. Clean barbeque grills after use and store  indoors.  10. Don’t place melon rinds or fruit in a  compost pile except in winter.  11. Don’t leave groceries in your car  overnight.  12. Keep poisons and garbage bags locked  inside a shed.  13. Keep woodpiles away from your house.  “Remember: a fed bear is a dead bear.”   Protect humans and Sandia black bears!  3   The GRIT – August 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 8                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

Please be vigilant concerning our two main problems during the  summer season:     First, be aware of someone knocking on your door or ringing your doorbell  during the day.  Chances are it could be a burglar checking to see if you are home or not.  Always  acknowledge the knock or ring.  You can yell through the door letting them know you are home.   Try to get a description and call 242-2677(COPS) with it so a unit can check the area. NEVER  ignore it! If they think no one is at home, they will break in and now you will be confronting  burglars with you still at home.     Second, please remember to lock your car if it sits outside. Believe it or not, most of our auto  burglaries are done by the thief simply opening the car door. That’s why they troll the  neighborhoods trying door handles looking for the ones left unlocked. Don’t leave the garage remote  in the car either. If they get it, they can get inside your home through the garage door. Finally,  remember this little saying; “If you want to find something of value in your car in the morning, don’t  leave it in the car overnight!”      Remember and practice the above and you will have a much happier summer.

The  verbal report given to us was that the water  level in the two older wells was still at  approximately the same level as in previous  years and the water level of the new  auxiliary well drilled and brought on line in  2012 was NOT dropping appreciably.  Overall we have an excellent water supply  for Sandia Heights, both in quantity and  quality of water.          THANKS to Sandia Heights Services for  anticipating our water needs and potential  supply issues caused by prolonged drought.                 From the Parks & Safety  Committee: County  Homeowners to Receive  Discounts on Flood Insurance  Premiums - Premiums will be  discounted 5 to 10 percent       Bernalillo County – The Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  has upgraded Bernalillo County’s  Community Rating System (CRS)  classification.

It’s hot, and there’s no rain in  sight.  With the current state of drought, it’s  a great time to think about updating your  landscape to be more water wise.  “Water  wise” also translates into less maintenance,  less water and money, and more time for  you!  Here are some basic ideas to  consider….       Xeric plants, including most native and  adapted plants recommended for our area,  prefer gravel mulch to conserve moisture.   Consider the use of bark mulch in areas next  to your home or walls for water-loving  plants.    Shredded cedar bark mulch repels  pests and holds in moisture, which means  less maintenance, water, and cost for you.   The shredded mulch won’t blow or float  away, and it forms a nice mat over the  ground, which helps keep out weeds.         Reduce sod areas where you can.  The  Landscape Guidelines (see  Sandiahomeowners. org) state that lawn  areas must be less than 500 square feet.   To  reduce the amount of sod, consider adding  flagstone paths through the sod or expanding  existing shrub beds, which you can then fill  with xeric plants.  You can also over seed  bluegrass areas with a more drought-tolerant  type of grass, such as buffalo grass.    Avoid raking up dormant/dead native grass.   The root and leaf systems hold the soil  together and prevent erosion.  If you’re  concerned about fire danger, trim grasses to  less than 12” tall, but leave the remainder of  the plant.  Think Dust Bowl….       Embrace container gardening.  With  large pots, you can control the water and the  sun exposure, and your plants will be very  happy.  We dug up an ailing rose bush from  the garden, popped her in a big pot, and this  year, we have many magnificent blooms.   As the sun changes angles, just move the pot  to accommodate.    Pots are a great way to have that pop of  color or accent, and they are really easy to  manage.

Decide what plants  are going to be watered and which ones are  going to fend for themselves.  Plants in low  spots and native species will be best able to  survive without supplemental watering.       Get to know cactus and succulents.  These  are wholly unique plants that are wonderfully  adapted to our climate.  Many have wonderful  shapes and textures and amazing flowers.  You  can’t get lower maintenance than a cactus!       Be Fire Wise (see Firewise.org for more  information) and be sure to remove any trees or  large shrubs that are right up against the house  or under a deck or overhang.  Make sure that  any dead vegetation is removed from your  property to reduce fuel loads, and keep grasses  trimmed low.  The Black Forest Structure  Protection video on vimeo.com, created by my  colleagues and friends at Colorado Springs Fire  Department, shows how Fire Wise techniques  can make a huge difference for your property.       Remember that most landscape changes do  require approval by the Architectural Control  Committee, and many projects can be approved  administratively, which means in just a couple  of days.  Also, remember that your ACC is a  resource for you to use:  we have experts that  will help with information and ideas, a small  library of books available at the SHHA office,  and general encouragement.

Covenant Support Committee             Your Covenant Support Committee (CSC) would like to pass along a friendly reminder  regarding the long-term parking of recreational vehicles (RVs), travel trailers and boats in the  Sandia Heights neighborhood.  This is not a new issue within our community, and at times  becomes a major irritant for other residents.  Although the published covenants for the earliest  developed units do not specifically spell out RVs, the Second Judicial Court in the late 1990s  determined long-term parking of RVs, camper trailers and boats on all residential lots in Sandia  Heights is prohibited.  The court allowed parking of such vehicles for a period of no more than  48 hours for maintenance and provisioning.        The CSC does not police the neighborhood for violations; however, if a complaint is received,  your homeowners association and the CSC will act upon it with the full authority and backing of  the judicial system.  We would ask all residents with RVs, travel trailers and boats to be good  neighbors and respect the rights of other residents and adhere to the covenants.  Please keep in  mind that the covenants are here to ensure we can continue to live in a pristine community and  maintain the value in our homes.      Notice: Any corrections to anything found in the printed   version of this GRIT can be found on the website.
