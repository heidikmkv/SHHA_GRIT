Ralph Waldo Emerson         I have stood on this bridge on a clear, cool  day and turned slowly in a circle trying to grasp  the emotions that came with so much feeling as  tears gently rolled down my face. I think of the  fear that those good men and boys must have felt  as they prepared to face the most feared  professional army in the world. All were  farmers, craftsmen, shopkeepers, family men all.  They did not know that their brief stand would  never die and its philosophical importance  would ignite a nation. Less than one month  earlier Patrick Henry of Virginia had delivered  his moving speech to the Second Virginia  Convention when speaking of the buildup of the  British navy and army units in the American  Colonies. Henry had almost predicted the battle  at Lexington and Concord. Perhaps the  Minutemen had Henry’s speech on their minds  as they formed up on that April day in 1775.  The last paragraph of Patrick Henry’s speech,  March 1775:  “It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, ‘Peace, Peace’ but there is  no peace. The way is actually begun! The next  gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our  ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren  are already in the field! Why stand we here idle?  What is it that gentlemen wish? What would  they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as  to be purchased at the price of chains and  slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not  what course others may take; but as for me, give  me liberty or give me death!       At Concord that day, they would have heard  the drums and fifes of the British as they came  out of the woods, seen the bright red uniforms as  the British crossed the bridge and with military  precision formed up in front of them about 100  yards away. It must have been terrifying,  knowing with certainty you were going to die.  They had been called out so urgently, no time  for goodbyes. Now, here they stood and there  were not enough of them to make a real  difference. They were afraid of being cowardly;  they were not. Witnessed by their families,  friends, and mates standing in the ranks with  them, they held their positions. Small in number,  they fired their muskets, received vicious volleys  from the British regulars in return, and taking  heavy casualties before they broke. They had  made a statement, not yet known to them, that  rallied a nation yet to be born.       As I stood on the bridge, looking out at the  trees that once had been open farmland, my wife  joined me and we stood there together, thankful  for the bravery exhibited there that day. It is true  what Emerson said: it was ‘the shot heard round  the world.’    By Lawrence Fultz, SHHA member and Sandia  Heights resident    2   The GRIT – July 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 7                                                                                                        Officers  President – Ann Zimmerman  Vice President – Joe Pappe  Secretary – George Connor  Treasurer – Ann Marie  Caffrey  Board Members  Bob Bower  Sharon Evanich  Sarah Holt  Anderson Kressy  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Emily Rudin  Ed Stretanski  Dick Wavrik    Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator &  Publications &  Communications Editor    SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org    GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit  any submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.     Announcements & Notices:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.    Office Closed: Thursday, July 4 and Friday, July 5 for  Independence Day Holiday   SHHA Board Meeting – Wednesday, July 10 at 7pm in the  SHHA Office.   Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes, email alerts and  contractor evaluation binder free to members.   Committee meetings are posted on our website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.   Safety Vests for sale in the SHHA office. $2 per vest for  members.    SHHA membership cards: do not forget to go to the  website to get a full listing of the companies that offer a  discount!       On-line GRIT Newsletter  By Anderson Kressy, Communications & Publications, Chair         The GRIT newsletter is posted on the SHHA website  www.sandiahomeowners.org.

To that end, this last year we  checked on maintenance and other issues in  both Little Cloud & W L Jackson Parks.  We  resolved issues with overgrown or too many  chamisa, weed, and trees along trails and in  road right-of-ways, with the help of BC &  NM road personnel. We implemented an  additional Doggie Pooh collection station in  Domingo Baca Arroyo to make it easier to  pick up after your dogs and help keep the  Rio Grande water shed clean.  We checked  out many residents’ calls and concerns  about Park issues and various Safety issues  in Sandia Heights and resolved or helped  resolve as many as possible.  We wrote and  published more than one article for the  GRIT about:  o Dog leash rules and printed  directions to a DOG off-leash park  north of Paseo Del Norte.  o Vehicle speed & parking, bicycles &  skateboards, pedestrians, emergency  vehicle access, and road signage.  o SHHA still sells bright Orange vests  at a low cost to help walkers &  others be more visible to motorists.       If you have a neighborhood park,  recreation, or safety concern, call or email  the SHHA and your Parks and Safety  committee will take a look at it.  We don’t  promise that we can FIX or REMEDY every  concern - but we will always investigate  your concern and get back to you. Be SAFE  and ENJOY our wonderful neighborhood!    PARKS & SAFETY COMMITTEE      DEAD Trees & Shrubs in Sandia  Heights are unsightly and a serious fire  hazard.  We are seeing many more dead  trees and shrubs in our neighborhood this  year because of the prolonged drought.        PLEASE, if you have DEAD trees or  shrubs on your property, have them cut  down and removed before they accidentally  ignite.  They are a disaster waiting to happen  and a serious danger to you and many of our  neighbors in Sandia Heights!!!  If one of  your neighbors has dead trees or shrubs on  their property, talk to them about THE  NEED to have them removed soon. And if  you notice dead trees or shrubs on County  right-of-ways or County property, call the  BC road department at 848-1503 and request  they remove the dead plants. THANKS to  each and every Sandia Heights resident for  being vigilant and helping eliminate these  unsightly plants and the real danger that  dead trees and shrubs pose to our  community.    4   The GRIT – July 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 7                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:   Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

Position your feeders 10 feet from each end of the  poles/limbs. Stop feeding for a time if seed is accumulating on the ground. If you have high  eaves, or second story eaves, you can hang feeders from them.    Tip Three: Don’t leave pet food outside. Pet food attracts other unwanted critters too.    Tip Four: Feed small amounts of seed that will last only several hours in the morning. This will  work only if you’ve had no bear visitors. If a bear is in your feeders, you will need to stop  feeding for a time.    Tip Five: Stop feeding birds from May 1 thru November 15. In past years, people who called  NMG&F to complain or ask for trapping of bears for being in their bird feeders were told to stop  feeding birds during these recommended dates.  ‘everson orl worsen an enersement by HMA  ‘Sandia Heights Average Sold Prices vs. Other Areas 7 Neighborhod [2006p SSF [2012 Ag SSF [ Cham | jem aecollum 1s Datla rae 321778 | 8171.33] 21.33%] tostee bale race (505) 269-6217 Tana 3172 | $138.30] 19249 (505) 269-3717 SMMiadtQewlcon | Noch ABQ Acs | —si9708_| _s159.22 | 19.19 Janteom High Deca | 234.9 | $193.33 | 186 ‘Sharon and Judon McColl have promoted Sandia Heights property ales for ovr 25 years We maket to support improving home value in Sandia Heights Cll 505) 269-6217 for your FREE Market Analysis today  FORSALET) wsrincrvi sw  (605 Codec HLRANE Onc Swe toe  12007-2013 MARKET ACTIVITY « SANDIA HEIGHTS FORSALY  , 3077-2019 MARKET ACTIVITY = SANDIA HEIGHTS ATTACHED TOWNHOMES  {he FUT 2019-Voen 28-No.7 YOUR HOME SOLD, GUARANTEE!

The  committee attempts to resolve these issues  by interfacing with the complainant as well  as the alleged violator to determine whether  there is a violation. The committee bases its  decision on the specific covenant of the  many different Units within Sandia Heights  and the relationship between the violator and  complainant’s Unit.     Since the 2012 Annual Meeting the CSC has  received 54 complaints. The majority of  these complaints were resolved within a few  weeks through the cooperation of all parties.  The Committee very much appreciates this  cooperation. Four complaints were resolved  after action by the SHHA attorney which  cost the association membership $4254.96.  Two complaints were turned over to the  ACC as they were architectural violations  and four complaints are still in process.      The successful resolution of the above  complaints would not be possible without  the many hours of work on behalf of SHHA  by the dedicated, committed and hard- working members of the CSC.        Covenant Support Committee     Vacation season is rapidly approaching and  your Covenant Support Committee would  like to pass along a friendly reminder  regarding the long-term parking of  Recreational Vehicles (RVs), travel trailers  and boats in the Sandia Heights  neighborhood.  This is not a new issue  within our community, and at times  becomes a major irritant for other residents.   Although the published covenants for the  earliest developed units do not specifically  spell out RVs, the Second Judicial Court in  the late 1990s determined long-term parking  of RVs, camper trailers and boats on all  residential lots in Sandia Heights is  prohibited.  The court allowed parking of  such vehicles for a period of no more than  48 hours for maintenance and provisioning.     The CSC does not police the neighborhood  for violations, however, if a complaint is  received, your homeowners association and  the CSC will act upon it with the full  authority and backing of the judicial system.   We would ask all residents with RVs, travel  trailers and boats to be good neighbors and  respect the rights of other residents and  adhere to the covenants.  Please keep in  mind that the covenants are here to ensure  we can continue to live in a pristine  community and maintain the value of our  homes.       8   The GRIT – July 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 7                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   5 Juniper Hill Road – Replace Window and  Gate  33 Juniper Hill Road – Deck  52 Cedar Hill Road – Driveway Extension  179 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Fence  Replacement  358 Big Horn Ridge Road - Driveway  422 Live Oak Court – Stucco/Canale Repair  505 Black Bear Loop – Stucco Repair  524 Live Oak Place – Repaint Soffit & Fascia  882 Tramway Lane - Landscaping  883 Tramway Lane - Landscaping  901 Tramway Lane – HVAC Installation  913 Tramway Lane – Patio Floor Replacement  1101 San Rafael – Resurface Driveway  1105 San Rafael - Pergola  1176 Laurel Place – Replace Swamp Cooler  1241 Rockrose Road – Replace Swamp Cooler  1708 Quail Run Court – Reseal Driveway  1802 Tramway Terrace Loop – HVAC  Replacement  1822 Tramway Terrace Loop – Shed  1850 Tramway Terrace Loop – Recoat  Driveway  1851 Tramway Terrace Loop – Window/Door  Replacement  1868 Tramway Terrace Loop – PV Panels  1911 Quail Run Road – Window Replacement  1928 Quail Run Drive – Landscaping  2021 Quail Run Drive – Swamp Cooler and  Window/Door Replacement  2828 Tramway Circle – Landscaping  2829 Tramway Circle – Reroof  2308 Calle de Rafael - PV Panels  2533 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence  2727 Tramway Circle – Fence Replacement  2740 Tramway Circle – Furnace Replacement  2774 Tramway Place – Reroof, Re-stucco and  Window Replacement  2817 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  and Repaint Garage Door/Trim  2828 Tramway Place- Landscaping  12625 Carmel Court – Garage Door  Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       SUMMARY OF ACC ACTIVITIES  FOR 2012 ~ Bob Bower, Chairman    Just as a reminder, your ACC is chartered by  all SHHA Unit covenants and manages the  architectural review process for SHHA.   Specifically, the ACC reviews all external  construction efforts to ensure that these projects  are in harmony with the natural surroundings  and with nearby residences. The ACC may  conduct neighborhood reviews of major  projects and strives to make a final approval  decision within 30 days from the submission of  the project application.    The year 2012 was similar to the past few years  in terms of the number of applications reviewed  and approved. A total of 326 projects were  approved (there were 303 approvals in 2011).   The Committee is staffed with nine dedicated  volunteers and continues to meet on the first  and third Wednesdays of the month.

We are in our eighth year of our  Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” couples dining activity. We meet bimonthly in small groups in  the homes of our members. Each small group consists, typically, of three couples plus a host  couple, with each couple contributing to some part of the dinner menu. By “couple”, we mean  any twosome that makes sense.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance.  Our 2012-2013 season is in full swing.  The schedule for the second half of the season is March  9 and May11 in small groups, then a whole group activity in July as a culminating event for the  season.  We’re always looking for new couples to join us, so if this sounds like an activity that  might appeal to you, please call or e-mail Paula Knarr for more information- 821-3444 or  kpknarr@comcast.net    Sandia Heights Artists: Sandia Heights Studio Art tour is September 7-8.
