His enduring themes, articulate  and amusing stories, and populist ideals  make him one of those rare young artists  who is carrying the torch of Woody Guthrie  and Ramblin' Jack Elliott. He rolls in off the  road, pulls out a guitar, and proceeds to take  us back to the basics: family, love, gratitude,  laughter. It's the timeless art of the true  troubadour, keeping alive the American folk  tradition.    A prolific songwriter, multi-instrumentalist  and true entertainer, Klyma brings to every  show a deep catalog of material that  assumes audiences are both smart and able  to laugh. Laughing is guaranteed! Check out  his music at www.klyma.com.    This will be an all-ages, alcohol-free event,  presented by the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association  (www.sandiahomeowners.org). General  admission is $15/adults, $10/teens and  seniors 60+, $5/12 & under, under 5 free.  Admission for SHHA members & their  overnight houseguests is FREE.

Viewing the  online version is free. The printed mailed  GRIT costs SHHA members over $15,000  per year and lots of trees! You can sign up to  receive email alerts and you will receive a  notification, including the link, when the  online version of the GRIT is available for  viewing. The aim is to have members  consider receiving the GRIT electronically  instead of the printed version. The  advantages, besides saving trees and  reducing mailing and printing costs, are  quite attractive: the electronic version is in  color and has useful internet links to passive  and dynamic internet pages. For example,  we can, in the future, include video and  PowerPoint presentations of events of  interest to SH residents. Also, the on-line  version is higher resolution.     Email Alerts: If you do decide to sign up  for the online GRIT you will also receive  email alerts regarding any activity in the  Sandia Heights area that might affect you,  such as an SHHA event, a wildlife alert or a  security issue.

Here are some tips from the Sandia  Heights Security Patrol:     If you display your Christmas tree in a window, don’t put your presents under the tree  where they can be easily seen from the road.  This is an open invitation for a thief.   When you return home from holiday shopping, pull your car into the garage and close the  garage door before unloading your gifts from the trunk.  If it is not possible to do this, take  a look around before you unload the vehicle.   Never leave gifts in the trunk or back of your vehicle outside overnight.  If someone will go  to the trouble to steal your stereo or other valuables, they will certainly try to take what is  out of the trunk or backseat as well.   If you must leave a vehicle parked in a driveway or on the street, remove the garage door  opener.     Contact the Sandia Heights Security Patrol for a special security watch if you are going to  be away from your home.  This service is available to security subscribers, so if you are not  a subscriber contact our office at 505-856-6419 to sign up today!!    Have a safe and happy holiday season!!!!!!!!  | Moving.

It is difficult for drivers  to see walkers and joggers. Please consider  the safety tips below:    Pedestrian Safety Tips   Walk Facing Traffic; make eye  contact with drivers approaching you.   Wear reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening. SHHA members can purchase  theirs in the office for only $2!    If you are walking a dog, keep the dog  to your left.   Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single file.   If you expect to be out before sunrise  or after sunset, please carry a light.       Trash and Recycle Bins   By Joe Pappe, Chairman, Covenant Support  Committee    With the change to large rolling bins for  both trash and recyclables came some  unintended consequences. It seems that  many residents are now leaving their bins  either on the roadside or next to their homes  where they are visible to neighbors and  passersby. We would like to remind  everyone that improper storage of trash cans  is a violation of all our Sandia Heights  Covenants which state in general:     “Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed  from public view . . . “   Please, when your  trash and recyclables have been collected,  return your bins to storage out of public  view. Thanks for helping keep Sandia  Heights a beautiful place for all of us to live.          A Short Reminder on  Submitting ACC Project  Applications   By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC    Let’s discuss emergency situations at your  home that may require your immediate  attention.  If your roof or some windows  suddenly develop leaks, go ahead and get  these items repaired to prevent further  damage to your home. When finished with  these repairs, it is requested that you submit  an after-the-fact application to the ACC and  it will be approved immediately.  If you  eventually want to replace your windows or  the entire roof, you will need to submit  additional applications for these projects and  obtain ACC approval prior to the start of  these non-emergency upgrades.    In other emergency situations such as the  repair of broken or clogged water or sewer  lines, repair or replacement of a septic  system or of some of its components, or  other situations where the urgency of the  situation requires quick action in order to  minimize property damage and  inconvenience to you as the homeowner, the  ACC does not want to stand in your way.                                          Continued on page 8     8   The GRIT – December 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 12                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    If a situation like this arises, just let the SHHA  office know (call 797-7793) that you will be  tending to an emergency situation and, if  applicable,  that  heavy  equipment  for  excavations may be required.  This information  will help the office answer questions from your  neighbors who may be inquiring about what is  going on at your residence.    Just as a reminder, you are required by your  Unit covenants to submit an application to the  ACC for any project that changes the external  appearance of your residence.  Some examples  are the addition of a new room or garage bay,  installation  of  solar  panels,  restuccoing,  replacement of doors or windows, and  landscaping (walls, fences, patios, plants, etc.).   Correcting after-the-fact changes to your  property causes aggravation and can be  expensive if the ACC does not give its approval  of some or all of your project. Save yourself the  hassle of this kind of situation by applying to  the ACC for approval before you undertake a  project!  The ACC handles about 30 projects a  month but even with this heavy workload, the  ACC tries to approve all projects within no  more than 30 days depending on the  complexity of the project, and in many cases  within just a few days.  The ACC is here to  help you so please take advantage of our  expertise—we are absolutely willing to work  with you to make your remodeling experiences  as pleasant as possible.       ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   16 Juniper Hill Road – Re-stucco and Re-roof  112 White Oaks Drive – Window Replacement  184 Big Horn Ridge – Roof Repair  234 Spring Creek Lane – Re-roof  370 Big Horn Ridge – Re-stucco and Repaint  Garage Door  625 Black Hawk Drive – Driveway and Patio  Slab Replacement  641 Cougar Loop – Stucco Repair  678 Black Hawk Drive – Deck Extension and  Photovoltaic Panels  726-30 Tramway Vista Drive – Re-roof  749 Tramway Lane – Replace Garage Doors   753 Tramway Lane – Stone Fascia Trim  902 Tramway Lane – Roof Repair  940 Bobcat Blvd. – Step Replacement  951 Deer Drive – Roof Repair  1129 Marigold Drive – Re-roof  1161 Laurel Loop – Photovoltaic Panels  1176 Laurel Place – Replace A/C Screen  1424 San Rafael Ave. – Landscaping  1439 Honeysuckle Drive - Fence  1504 Eagle Ridge Road – Shade Structure   1701 Quail Run Court – Landscaping  2405 Tramway Terrace Court – Window  Replacement  2747 Tramway Circle – Re-roof   7724 Cedar Canyon Court – Landscaping  11107 Bobcat Place – Re-roof  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.         What to do with that Christmas  tree?
