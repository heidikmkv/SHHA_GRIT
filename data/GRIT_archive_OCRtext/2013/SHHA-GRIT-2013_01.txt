I grew up in Raton, NM,  and  according to my Dad, we had nine months of  winter, and three months of (d---)  bad weather.   One day, in December, my Dad brought home a  bobsled, with a plate screwed on  its hood  "made in Italy". Dad had found this sled in an  old run- down and falling  down shed in Las  Vegas, NM, with the very old owners, anxious  to sell. Dad's job, on the Santa Fe Railroad, was  Raton to Las Vegas. After bargaining with the  owners, Dad put his prize on the train that  snowy night, and brought it home, 709 Moulton  Avenue, fondly referred to as the Old Pass  Road.

It  was Saturday, and I was also up early,  checking the snow level, hoping there was  enough snow to sled. There it was, “Dad's  prize". A sled, a very long sled, with a blue  hood, a steering wheel, and even a rear  brake! Now you can bet that not one kid in  Raton, even me, had ever seen a bobsled  except in a picture book or at the movies.     "Oh, Dad, where did you get it? Is it for  me?" I was six years old, and this was  absolutely the best surprise ever. A bobsled  with a steering wheel just for me. I started to  run outside in my pj's, but Dad stopped me.     "Blitz, get your snow clothes on, wake up  your sister, and we will give it a try."      "Dad, Norma doesn't like to sled, she is  always cold, and it will take forever for her  to get up, and get dressed." "Ann, we'll wait  for her." From Dad's response, even at six, I  knew that this wasn't just for me. I would  have to share Dad's prize!    Before we could get it to the street, Dad and  I walked carefully around it, like he did  when he was buying a new car. I saw the  plaque on the hood, and at six years old  knew the words made and in, but had to ask  Dad what was the third word. Dad replied  "Italy, Ann; made in Italy."     "What's Italy?" Dad answered      "Italy is a country in Europe, like New  Mexico is a state in the United States of  America."      "Can we go there?"     "No Blitz, a nickname Dad coined for me,  there is a War going on, but someday I’ll bet  you get to Italy." After the walk around, Dad  indicated that it needed some repair, but  nothing major. The steering needed to be  tightened, and the runners needed cleaning  and waxing. I was not worried, K.P.  Zimmerman could fix anything.    Two runs down Moulton Avenue, on our  demon sled, with Norma driving, Dad  braking, and me in the middle, the  neighborhood began to awake. Kids burst  out of  their doors, running with excitement,  and shouting "Can I have a turn?" Dad  would not let me steer the sled. We would  have to practice together, and he promised  someday soon, I would be able to steer. Roy,  Bob, Jerry, Norma, Mary Ann, Mary Lynn,  and Geraldine took turns at steering that  morning, and Pat, Jimmy, and I rode in the  middle and waited to get older.     The bobsled would hold eight kids, all  squeezed together. We used the big boys  and a few brave girls to steer, and the  strongest, we put on the brake. I can still see  us whizzing down Moulton Avenue with  eight on the sled, me driving, Bobby on the   brake and Sandy Pittman (who was five) in  a wash tub we tied on the back with a long  rope.     Dad and the Italian bobsled he had bought  for ALL the kids in the neighborhood were  infamous in Raton. When I returned to the  25th and 50th year High School reunions,  the conversations, laughs, and fond  memories of Dad's "prize" were at the top of  the list.        4   The GRIT – January 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 1                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

Install  secondary thumbscrew locks on guide rails.  Place them in a location that  prohibits the window from being opened more than a few inches.  Also, make  sure screens are in place and secure.  (Note:  Windows and pet doors are  common illegal entry points)          If it snows while you’re out of town, get a neighbor to drive into your driveway (SHS will do this,  time and terrain permitting) and walk up to your door. Drifts of snow are a dead giveaway no one is  home. Burglars don’t take days off due to bad weather.      2013 Resident Directory and  Guide – here is the winning photo by Marie  Wise that is featured on the cover of the  directory.

Most of these occurred in the spring and fall.  In each complaint case, the homeowners  were not in covenant compliance and were  asked by the CSC to remove the house  trailers, trailers, and recreational vehicles  from their property by a specific number of  days.  SHHA members who own house  trailers, trailers, camper trailers, boats,  mobile homes, and recreational vehicles  should check their Unit Covenants regarding  the parking or storing restrictions on those  items.   All of the SHHA covenants have some form  of parking or storing restriction on house  trailers, trailers, camper trailers, boats,  mobile homes, and recreational vehicles.  Unit covenants can be found on the SHHA  website or by calling the SHHA office.         The Empty Nest - Rooms for  Rent  Now that the house is "too big" for you it is  tempting to make extra money by renting a  spare bedroom or offer bed and breakfast  (B&B) accommodations. We have received  complaints of homeowners listing their  homes on B&B websites for room rental by  the day, week, or month.  However, Sandia  Heights is zoned Residential (single family)  and therefore renting rooms is a Bernalillo  County zoning violation. The Unit  Covenants also prohibit renting rooms.    The CSC therefore asks that homeowners  comply with both the Covenants and the  zoning regulations and not rent out rooms. If  you have already posted your house on a  B&B web site please remove it. If you  suspect that a neighbor is renting out space  in their home please contact the SHHA and  they will help you fill out a complaint. We  will immediately investigate and seek  compliance either voluntarily or with the  help of the County Zoning Department, or  other legal channels. Aside from the code  and covenant violations it is also a safety  concern for the neighborhood. Sandia  Heights Security monitors unfamiliar cars  and activities in order to preserve the safety  of the residents. Remember, this is a Single  Family Residential Area.  Please help keep it  that way.   Trash and Recycle Bins   Last summer brought a change in trash  pickup in our Sandia Heights neighborhood.     With the change to large rolling bins for  both trash and recyclables came some  unintended consequences.      It seems that many residents are now leaving  their bins either on the roadside or next to  their homes where they are visible to  neighbors and passersby.   We would like to  remind everyone that improper storage of  trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants which state in general:     “Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed  from public view . . . “   Please, when your  trash and recyclables have been collected,  return your bins to storage out of public  view.     Thanks for helping keep Sandia Heights a  beautiful place for all of us to live.       8   The GRIT – January 2013 – Volume 29 – No. 1                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   1 Juniper Hill Road – Remodel & Landscaping  30 Juniper Hill Loop – Landscaping after  construction  51 Rock Ridge Drive – Fence Repair  85 Juniper Hill Place – Garage Door  Replacement  140 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Landscaping  158 Juniper Hill Road – Remodel/Addition  560 Black Bear Place – Recoat Stucco  631 Cougar Loop – Patio & Portal  726-5 Tramway Vista Place - Patio  760-11 Tramway Lane – Re-stucco & Reroof  760-12 Tramway Lane – Parapet Repair & Re- stucco  925 Tramway Lane – Stucco Repair  965 Antelope Ave – Garage Addition  998 Lynx Loop – Deck  1059 Red Oaks Loop – Landscaping  1170 Laurel Loop – Replace Patio Cover  1601 Quailwood – Reroof & Re-stucco  1835 Tramway Terrace Loop – Reseal  Driveway  1840 Tramway Terrace Loop – Garage Reroof  2320 Calle de Gabriel – Repaint Walls  2876 Brushwood – Landscaping & Patio  8229 Raintree Drive – Repaint Walls  11106 Bobcat Blvd. - Reroof  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.         Summary of ACC Articles  Published in 2012 by Bob Bower,  Chairman, ACC    Following my usual custom for the January  GRIT, articles published during the prior year  are shown below for your reference.
