    Back-to-School Safety Checklist  By Parks and Safety Committee  Some things to consider as children head back to school:  Walking to School  • Review your family’s walking safety rules.   • Walk on the sidewalk, when available. If no sidewalk, walk on the left side of the  road facing oncoming traffic.   • Before crossing the street, stop, look left, look right, look left again for cars.   • Never dart out from in front of a parked car.   • Practice walking to school with your child. Cross streets at crosswalks when  available.  Riding a Bicycle to School   • Make sure your child always wears a helmet.   • Make sure the helmet fits correctly and is secured.   • Teach your child the rules of the road.   • Ride single file on the right side of the road with traffic.   • Come to a complete stop before crossing a street. Walk bike across street.   Taking the Bus to School  • Go to the bus stop with your child to teach the proper way to get on and off.   • Make sure your child stands six feet away (3 giant steps) from the curb.   • If you and your child need to cross the street in front of the bus, walk on the side of  the road until you are 10 feet ahead of the bus. You should always be able to see  the bus driver—and the bus driver should always be able to see you.  Many injuries at school are completely preventable. Follow these steps to  ensure your child is safe at school:  Preventing Backpack-Related Injuries  • Chose backpacks carefully. Look for ergonomic features for safety and comfort.   • Don’t overstuff a backpack! It should weigh no more than 20% of your child’s body  weight. For example, a child weighing 60 pounds should carry a backpack no  heavier than 12 pounds.   • Have your child use both straps to evenly distribute weight on their shoulders.  Preventing Playground Injuries  • Encourage your child to use playgrounds with soft surfaces. Avoid playgrounds with  concrete surfaces as they are too hard if your child falls.   • Children under the age of four should use climbing equipment with assistance and  adult supervision. And watch older children when they’re climbing, especially on  monkey bars.

This  article addresses how to prepare your property to max- imize your ability to escape with minimal damage.  There  are several good articles that give detailed descriptions  of how to create defense barriers around your house.   See the SHHA website Wildfire Preparedness tab for the  article “Ready, Set, Go.” Even more detail can be found  at www.livingwithfire.info.  Fire can cause damage to your house in three ways:   1. Contact with flames causes direct combustion of veg- etation and of the flammable materials of your house.    2. Radiant heat produced by the flames can cause dam- age without actual contact. The radiant heat can  cause materials to combust and windows to break al- lowing embers to enter the house.    3. However, most houses catch fire due to flying embers  which, depending on the wind, can travel more than  a mile from the original wildfire.  So what pre-fire activities can reduce your risk? The  most obvious is to create defensible zones around your  house. The “Ready, Set, Go” article describes three such  zones:    1. Zone 1: 0 to 30 feet from the house. Have a minimal  amount of woody vegetation and no trees that hang  over or come in contact with the house. Firewood and  other flammable materials should be stored outside  this zone.    2. Zone 2: 30 to 100 feet. In this zone there should be  clear separations between vegetation groups. Re- move any dead trees or dry vegetation.  3. Zone 3: 100 to 200 feet. In this area, thin the trees (at  least 10 feet between trees) and remove low  branches so that fire cannot climb from ground-level  vegetation to the lowest tree branches.  Another important zone to have is an “access zone.”   This could be a driveway with at least 12 feet of clearance  to allow easy access for emergency vehicles. Make note  of your nearest fire hydrant; if it is on your property,  clear the surrounding brush so it can be easily found and  used. Street signs and your home address should be  clearly visible. Bridges or culverts on your property  should be strong enough to allow access by heavy vehi- cles such as fire trucks.  Finally, the “interior zone”— your house itself—is  critical. Have you minimized highly flammable materials  such as cedar shakes? Exterior wood siding is quite com- bustible. Stucco, brick, stone, and cement board are bet- ter choices for houses and walls. Vents, gutters, and  chimneys should have screening to prevent embers  from getting into your home.  As a fire approaches, you will want to have hoses and  ladders available to wet down the house. And always be  aware that most people in a fire succumb to the smoke  and fumes, rather than to the fire itself. So, once you  have done all you can, be prepared to organize the fam- ily and evacuate (later articles).    Third Nearby Wildfire of the Summer    The photo below shows the burn from a fire on July 3  caused by a flaming pigeon. (The pigeon managed to  link two high-tension lines.) The wall at the back had al- ready been repainted before the photo was snapped. It  had been quite scarred. This fire was on the east side of  Tramway between San Bernardino and Paseo.                3   The GRIT – August 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 8   Sign of the Times  In anticipation of Fourth of July festivities, your  Homeowners Association purchased “sandwich  board” signs like the one below to place at every en- trance into Sandia Heights.                  Very few fireworks were seen or heard originating in  our community on or around Independence Day.    Think Snow!                              Now, don’t you feel just a little cooler?

That  issue is not covered in the various covenants of Sandia  Heights, but it is covered by County ordinance. Please see  below.  Bernalillo County Ordinance regarding animals:  Bernalillo County Ordinance No. 88-16 Section VI. A. states:  “It is unlawful for any person to allow or permit any animal  to run at large in or on any street, alley, sidewalk, vacant  lot, public property, other unenclosed place in the County;  or private property without the permission of the owner  thereof. Any animal permitted to run at large in violation  of this section is declared to be a nuisance, a menace to the  public health and safety, and shall be taken up and im- pounded. A working dog performing such acts as herding  or search and rescue under the control and supervision of  owner/handler shall not be considered as unleashed while  performing these duties. A hunting, obedience, tracking or  show dog shall not be considered unleashed while per- forming in the above capacities.”   Bernalillo County Ordinance No. 88-16 Section VI. E.  states: “Animal Nuisances on Sidewalks, Public Parks, Al- leys, and Other Places Open to the Public. It is unlawful for  the owner of any animal to permit, either willfully or  through failure to exercise due care of control, any such  animal to commit any nuisance upon the sidewalk or public  park; or upon the floor or wall of any common hall in any  multiple dwelling; or upon any entrance way, stairway or  wall immediately abutting on a public sidewalk, or upon  the floor or wall of any theater, shop, store, office building  or other building used in common by the public; or upon  any private property other than the owners of the animal.”   To see the full Bernalillo County Ordinance No. 88-16, go to  http://www.apnm.org/publications/animal_law/coun- ties/Bernalillo%20Co.pdf.  Sec. 6-47. – Animals disturbing the peace.  (a) It is unlawful for a person to allow an animal to persis- tently or continuously bark, howl or make noise common  to their species or otherwise disturb the peace and quiet  of inhabitants of the county.  (b) It is unlawful to keep or maintain an animal in such an  unclean or unsanitary manner that it disturbs others by  noxious or offensive odors. (Ord. of 2-26-13)  State Law reference — Noise by animals and fowl, §30- 20-1; offenses against public peace and order.  Sec. 6-51. – Animals running at large.  (a) It is unlawful for a person to allow or permit any ani- mal to run at large in or on any alley, street, sidewalk, va- cant lot, public property, other unenclosed place in the  county, or private property without the permission of the  property owner.  (b) An animal permitted to run at large in violation of this  section is declared to be a nuisance and a menace to the  public health and safety. Such animal may be taken up and  impounded. An animal care services officer may go upon  private property in pursuit of an animal which is running at  large unless permission to make such pursuit is explicitly  refused by the occupant. An officer may not enter a pri- vate building or residence in pursuit of an animal.  (c) A working dog performing such acts as herding or  search and rescue that is under the control and supervision  of the owner or handler shall not be considered as un- leashed while performing its duties. A hunting, obedience,  tracking or show dog that is under the control and super- vision of the owner or handler shall not be considered as  unleashed while performing in those capacities.  (d) It is unlawful for an owner, manager, agent, or govern- ing board of any multiple dwelling unit, including mobile  home parks and gated communities, to permit any ani- mal to run at large upon the common areas of the multiple  dwelling unit. (Ord. of 2-26-13)  Sec. 6-54. – Animal waste.  It is unlawful to permit a companion animal to defecate on  public or private property other than the property of the  owner of the animal unless such animal waste is immedi- ately removed and properly disposed of by the person hav- ing custody of the animal.      In summary, be a good neighbor. Keep your dog on a  leash away from your yard, reasonably quiet when at  home, and pick up waste. Leaving your pet’s mess is un- sightly and inconsiderate.   8   The GRIT – August 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 8                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  37 Sandia Heights Drive – Resurface Driveway  44 Rock Ridge Court – Wall Extension and Spa  150 Whitetail Road – Paint Stucco  151j Whitetail Drive – Deck Replacement  241 Spring Creek Place – Re-stain Wood Trim  513 Roadrunner Lane – Trash Bin Enclosure  655 Roadrunner Lane – Parapet Repair  727-4 Cedar Hill Lane – Reroof and Replace Skylights  795-L Tramway Lane – Repair and Refinish Restucco  795-M Tramway Lane – Restucco   1033 Tramway Lane – Restucco   1037 Red Oaks Loop – AC Replacement  1176 Laurel Place – Reroof  1202 Marigold Drive - Reroof  1454 Honeysuckle Drive – Remodel  1457 Bluebell Drive – Replace Windows and Doors  1536 Eagle Ridge Drive – Reroof   1701 Quail Run Court – Photovoltaic Panel Intallation  1852 Tramway Terrace Loop – Reroof and Restucco  1913 Quail Run Drive – Flag Pole Installation  2454 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Windows and  Fireplace  2736 Tramway Circle – Replace Pergola  2806 Tramway Circle – Restucco and Fence  Replacement  2874 Brushwood Street – Restucco   8218 Raintree Drive – Reroof  12618 Carmel Court – Patio Cover  12701 Colony Place – Paint Stucco and Trim    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org  to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.          COMMUNITY SURVEY   IS VERY POSITIVE!!  By Stephen S. Baca, Community Service &   Membership Committee Member  As members of Sandia Heights Board of Directors  (BOD), we thought that we were the cheerleaders  for Sandia Heights! Based on the results of our recent  survey, our community is every bit as enthusiastic  about living in Sandia Heights as your BOD is.    There will be more detailed results published in  The GRIT in the future and the entire survey will be  available on the SHHA website.  But here are a few of  the exciting things we learned from the survey:  The number of responses (712) was about double  what is normally expected. As a consequence, we  have a confidence level of over 95% and a margin of  error of less than 5%. So, this is great. The results are  even better. Two are especially important: 87% of you  are proud or extremely proud to live in Sandia  Heights; 89% of you feel safe walking alone in Sandia  Heights. And 58% of you strongly recommend Sandia  Heights as a place to live.    We received hundreds of ideas for making Sandia  Heights even better. And we got great feedback  validating the key themes from the Annual Meeting.   The BOD now has quantitative reasons for action.  Clearly, we are really enthusiastic about Sandia  Heights!     USE CARE CHOOSING LOCKSMITHS  By Bob Bower, Architectural Control Committee  I’d like to pass along some information from an  article  by  Amanda  Horowitz  in  “Consumer  Connection” that opened my eyes.  Apparently, there is a problem with scam artists  posing as on-line locksmiths, which is hurting not  only consumers, but legitimate locksmiths as well.  Here’s the general idea. The scammer creates a  phony on-line locksmith ad to attract real calls. Ads  may tout low prices, like $15 or $20 to come to your  home. The address may be fake or belong to a  different business. Your call goes to a call center that  dispatches an unqualified worker. Once at your  location, the worker says the job will cost much more  than the estimate and you must pay cash. Some  people have paid $1,200 for $100 worth of locks.  To avoid a problem, find a locksmith you trust  before you need one. And if you lock yourself out of  your vehicle, use your roadside assistance plan.  9 The GRIT - August 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 8 10 The GRIT - August 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 8 11   The GRIT – August 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 8                                                                                                     Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
