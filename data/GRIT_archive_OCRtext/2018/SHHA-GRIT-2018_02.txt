Instead written 2017 reports will be  provided on the SHHA website, sent by email to those on the email  distribution list, and copies will be in your Annual Association meeting  attendance packet.   You are being asked to review the reports prior to the meeting and  prepare any questions on the reports which will be answered at the Annual  Association meeting, or deferred as necessary. Report question forms will be  a part of the report package. At the Annual Association meeting you will be  given 15 minutes to review all reports, write your questions and turn them in  to the Secretary. Question forms must be submitted at the Annual Meeting.  Each report will be addressed in sequence and any questions presented will be  answered at that time, or deferred if necessary.  Reviewing the reports ahead of time and preparing any questions you  might have will facilitate us moving quickly through the business part of the  meeting thus providing us with more time for the SHHA Strategic planning  portion of the Annual Association meeting.

We need all of our residents’ help in keeping our  community looking its best! Please do your part by  remembering to:   Pick up and dispose of pet waste properly.   Pick up litter you notice in the community and dispose of it.    Remove trash and recycling bins from the curb as soon  as possible after collection. They must be stored out of  sight. Place them at the curb after 5 pm the day before  collection or before 7 am on collection day. During April  through November, when bears are active, wait until  the day of collection.   Keep trash secured from any wildlife looking for a snack.   Exterior lights must be shielded and shine on your property  only, never into your neighbor’s windows. Bernalillo County  also has enforceable lighting ordinances; call the County at  314-0350.    All external home and landscape changes must be approved  in advance by SHHA’s Architectural Control Committee. See  the website or Office for guidelines and applications.    Sound from construction, dogs barking, music, or  simply a friendly gathering carries far and can disturb  others.    RVs, camper trailers, and boats can be parked for up to  48 hours to load or unload them unless a method of  storage has been approved by the Architectural Control  Committee for your unit. Your covenants might require  that inoperable vehicles must be moved after 30 days.   Remove all dead or dying trees, shrubs, and brush.  Particularly if you own a patio home, remove weeds  and leaf litter frequently.              History of Sweethearts  From the NECCO® Candy Website    Sweethearts® share a storied history with our legendary  NECCO® Wafers, which isn’t surprising since their  inventors share a bloodline. Daniel Chase created the  first conversation hearts in 1866 by devising a machine  that would press food dye letters onto the candy  lozenges made famous by his brother and NECCO®  founder Oliver Chase.  Through the years, Sweethearts® sayings have  reflected how our country and culture has changed.  We’ve added Sweethearts® En Español, rolled out new  Dazzled varieties, even added and dropped sayings  based on how people communicate. From mid-February  to January we produce about 100,000 pounds of the  iconic candy hearts each day, which adds up to billions  of candy hearts—more than enough for everyone in the  world to have one.  Legend has it that Oliver’s NECCO wafers were  carried by Civil War soldiers, and some speculate that  the tradition of sending loving greetings to the troops  morphed into the conversation heart, but those claims  are hard to verify.   People loved  conversation candies  (they weren’t  available in heart  shapes until 1902)  and their witty  messages which could  stoke the flames of love or  warn off flaky suitors.       The GRIT Needs More Community  Specific Information    Between our Board of Directors, Committee  Chairs, and Office Staff we try to include items in our  monthly newsletter that inform homeowner members  of important business regarding the association, and in  addition, provide awareness of community  opportunities and issues. Putting together a newsletter  for our community can be quite challenging. Many of  our residents have interesting news and views, as well  as issues of community interest.   Articles from the Covenant Support Committee  and Architectural Control Committee are submitted  monthly to help remind homeowners of why the Board  must make decisions that it does and can help make  living in a common interest development more  comfortable for all. Another benefit of increasing the  awareness of association issues is to help motivate  members to take an active role in our community.   The GRIT editorial policy is available on our  website at:  http://sandiahomeowners.org/images/downloads/GRIT_ Editoral_Policy_Website.pdf. All articles are due to the  SHHA office on or before the 10th of the month prior. For  example, an article to be run in the March GRIT issue is  due no later than February 10th. You may send articles to  the SHHA Office staff at sandiaheights@comcast.net.    3   The GRIT – February 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 2                                                                                                    CSC Active Violations Log  January 2018    Unit No.  Type of Suspected  Violation  SHHA Court Action  S8  Accumulation of  Trash/Debris      4 Files Closed Since the Last GRIT    CSC Covenant Reminder  By Ruth Haas, CSC Member    When we bought our houses in Sandia Heights, we  all got a package at closing that included an  explanation of what the homeowner’s association  does and the covenants that governed use of our  property. However, for most of us all that legal- looking stuff was too much to deal with, so it was  filed along with all the other documents.  And with the passage of time, we didn't get  around to reading the covenants. Until  one day we got a letter from the SHHA office  saying we were in violation of the  covenants.  To help avoid such unpleasant surprises,  the Covenant Support Committee has prepared  a one-page summary of requirements that apply  to all units even though particular covenants will  differ across units. It takes less than a minute to  read and is a handy reference if you are thinking  about installing new lights, buying an RV, or  considering home or landscape improvements.    Sandia Peak Tramway Pass  Procedure for SHHA Homeowner  Members    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA)  offers discounted Tramway Passes as a benefit to  homeowner members. SHHA has purchased eight  (8) Tram passes per day for 2018. Since we only  have a limited amount of passes to give out each  day, you should plan ahead. We cannot take  reservations over the phone; Tram passes are sold  on an in person, first come first served basis,  although, you may call the office or login to the  SHHA website to find out if the day you want is  available. The office will issue you an authorization  letter which may not be exchanged for another  day or returned to the office for a refund. If the  Tram closes on the day you purchased passes for,  the cashier at the Tramway will stamp the tickets  for a 30-day raincheck, or SHHA will issue you a  refund.    Here is how it works:    Pick a date you want to ride the Tram. The  SHHA office will issue you an authorization  letter for that particular date to be used for that  date only. Your $6.00 per pass will only be  reimbursed if the Tram is closed.    NOTE: Only 1 date may be reserved at a time per  residence. You may buy as many passes as  available on the 1 day you choose. However, you  have to use the tickets bought before you may  purchase passes for another date.   Come in to the SHHA Office and pay $6.00 per  person (check or cash only). Children under 5  years old ride the Tram for FREE and do not  need a pass!   On the day of your reservation, you will take  this authorization letter to the cashier at the  Tram and they will give you the actual Tram  pass(es.)   Passes are available only during days and  hours that the Tram is available to the public.  Hours can be found on their website at:  http://sandiapeak.com/index.php?page=san dia-peak-tramway.  4   The GRIT – February 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 2                                                                                                     WE ARE ACCEPTING ENTRIES FOR OUR ANNUAL  PHOTO CONTEST FOR THE 2019 SANDIA HEIGHTS  RESIDENT GUIDE AND DIRECTORY.

These types of situations have been an  on-going issue here in our community and are expensive to remedy. The following is the text of a letter that  the ACC will be sending to 50 of the local roofing contractors to try to educate these contractors regarding our  covenants.    To Whom It May Concern:    This letter is sent to you since our records indicate that you have previously had contracts to install residential roofs  here in the Sandia Heights Community. As you may know, Sandia Heights is a covenant-controlled community of  approximately 2200 residential properties and our covenants have specific criteria related to roofing materials. The  Architectural Control Committee (ACC) is responsible for enforcement of the covenants related to architectural  standards throughout the community. All property owners in the community must obtain the approval of the ACC  prior to the start of any construction efforts that directly affect alterations to the external appearance of the  property. The approval of roofing material prior to its installation falls within the ACC’s responsibilities. When  negotiating a contract with a resident living within the Sandia Heights Community, please make sure that the  property owner fully understands that the ACC must approve the roofing material prior to its installation.    Within the Sandia Heights Community, there are about 40 different subdivisions that have been incorporated into  the community since development first commenced in the late 1960s. The majority of these covenants specifically  prohibit the installation of white roofing material. Since the community generally slopes downwards from its  eastern boundaries towards the west, the early developers prohibited the use of white roofing material since it was  considered to be a “visual nuisance” to those residents living upslope from residences to the west of their  properties. For this reason, the ACC developed a guideline to ensure that roofs are in compliance with the  covenants and do not reflect nuisance levels of light onto nearby properties. This guideline, entitled “ACC Design  Guideline for Roofing”, is available to you and a copy can be obtained from the Association office located at 12760  San Rafael Avenue, suite 2B. This address is about one block east of Tramway Boulevard on the south side of San  Rafael Avenue. The Guideline can also be downloaded from our website at www.sandiahomeowners.org. Just click  on the “Committees” displayed on the site’s header page, select the “Architectural Control Committee” listing and  access the “ACC Design Guidelines” from the dropdown menu. The “ACC Design Guideline for Roofing” is one of six  guidelines available from that menu.    In summary, the ACC Design Guideline for Roofing states the following:    •  Roofs that are exposed to view from nearby properties shall have a Light Reflectance Value of 65 or less  (indicative of a tan or darker color) and a specular gloss value of 20 or less (indicative of a flat, matte, velvet,  eggshell, or suede finish). Please refer to the guideline for more details related to these specifications.    I hope that this information is useful. Occasionally, the ACC will encounter a situation where a resident failed to  obtain ACC approval prior to the installation of a new roof or for the modification of a major portion of an existing  roof and use a roofing material that the ACC would not approve. These situations are difficult for both the property  owner and the ACC. Again, as a reminder, please make sure that the property owner has obtained ACC approval  prior to the installation of any roofing material. Feel free to contact the Association office if you have any questions  regarding the contents of this letter or if you need assistance with your interpretation of the Guideline.    Sincerely,    Bob Bower, ACC Chairman  8   The GRIT – February 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 2                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:  645 Cougar Loop – Reroof and Restucco  867-F Tramway Lane Court – Reroof and Replace  Skylights  1024 Tramway Lane – Reroof and Stucco Repair  1025 Tramway Lane – Install Stuccoed Block Wall  1169 Laurel Place – Garage Addition  1199 Bobcat Blvd – Install Security Bars and Doors  2005 Quail Run Drive – Landscaping  2014 Quail Run Drive – Window Replacement  2318 Calle de Gabriel – Exterior Lighting and  Parapet Repair  2758 Cliffrose Drive – Reroof  2805 Tramway Circle – Reroof  2866 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  2892 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  8213 Indigo Court – Replace Concrete Driveway  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.
