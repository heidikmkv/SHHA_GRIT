In 1964, Dr.  King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.    The civil rights leader was born Michael King Jr.  on January 15, 1929. In 1934, however, his father, a  pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church,  traveled to Germany and became inspired by the  Protestant Reformation leader Martin Luther. As  a result, King Sr. changed his own name as well as  that of his 5-year-old son.    The holiday, first commemorated in 1986, is  celebrated on the third Monday in January, close  to the civil rights leader’s January 15 birthday.         3   The GRIT – January 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 1                                                                                                    CSC Active Violations Log  December 2017    Unit No.  Type of Suspected  Violation  S19  Yard Maintenance  SHHA Court Action  S8  Accumulation of  Trash/Debris      No Files Closed Since the Last GRIT    CSC Legal Action  By Judy Chreist, CSC Member    Recently the CSC took the rare step of pursuing  resolution of a covenant violation complaint  through the court system. This occurs only after all  attempts to persuade the violator to come into  compliance have failed.    The Court action involves considerable time and  legal expense for SHHA. Is it worth it? On the  neighborhood/CSC side, it is important to enforce  our covenants for the enjoyment of all. Trash,  dead trees, or bright night lighting, to use specific  examples, do not contribute positively to our  unique neighborhood.    A new precedent in the pursuit of bringing  violators into compliance was set by our latest  court case. Not only was it ruled that the violator  must comply with the covenants within 30 days,  but the CSC was also awarded a judgment against  the violator to require reimbursement of CSC legal  fees because the violator acted in bad faith by  ignoring the CSC’s requests to comply and forcing  CSC to incur legal fees.     Bringing a property into compliance upon the  initial complaint is not just part of being a good  neighbor, but could be the more prudent course  financially for the property owner.  Trash Cans    This is the time of year when we generate lots of  trash and recyclables. If there is too much for your  recycle bin, paper and boxes can be taken to the  Eagle Rock transfer station (no charge for the  outside bin use) or places like the Sonic/Lowes on  Juan Tabo. You can also call Sandia Heights Services  at 856-6419, and ask what other options, like special  pickups, might be arranged. Remember that your  trash bins need to be out of sight except on pick-up  day. Trash bins should be placed behind a fence or  screen, or put in the garage.

Start the New Year with a New Mexico  Recipe Tradition    As of 1989, the New Mexico official state cookie is  Biscochitos. These Biscochitos, which are like  butter cookies or shortbread with a pleasant anise  and cinnamon flavor, are an especially popular  tradition during the holiday season here in the  Southwest.     Biscochitos: Traditional New Mexican Cookies    Prep time: 40 mins  Total time: 40 mins          Author: Some the Wiser  Serves: 3 dozen    Ingredients  •  3 cups all-purpose flour  •  1½ teaspoons baking powder  •  ½ teaspoon salt  •  3 teaspoons crushed anise seed  •  zest of one orange  •  1¼ cups lard  •  ¾ cup sugar  •  1 large egg  •  1 teaspoon pure  vanilla extract  For the Topping  •  ½ cup sugar  •  1 teaspoon ground  cinnamon  Instructions    1. In a large bowl, sift  together flour, baking  powder, and salt. Whisk in the anise and  orange zest.  2. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar and  lard. Using an electric mixer, beat the lard and  sugar until light and fluffy - about 3 minutes.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat to combine.  Gradually beat in the flour mixture and stop  as soon as mixture is combined. Dough should  be thick and similar in consistency to pie crust  dough. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.  3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking  sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl,  combine the sugar and cinnamon for topping.  4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to  ¼ inch thickness. Cut out cookies. Place  cookies on lined baking sheet and bake until  just barely golden and set, about 10 to 12  minutes. Let cookies cool for 1 minute, then  carefully dunk them into the sugar mixture.  Place on cookie rack until completely cooled.    Note:  Traditional Biscochitos use lard and taste better  because of it, but you can substitute vegetable  shortening or unsalted butter.    8   The GRIT – January 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 1                                                                                                   ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:  176 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Retaining Wall  184 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Roof Repair  357 Juniper Hill Road – Replace Front Entrance  Walkway and Install Retaining Wall  451 Live Oak Lane – Reroof  550 Black Bear Road – Wooden Bear Sculpture  948 Deer Drive – Landscaping   1430 Honeysuckle Drive – Addition  1503 Eagle Ridge Road – Replace Gates  1860 Tramway Terrace Court – Paint House  1860 Tramway Terrace Court – Landscaping  2157 Black Willow Drive – Window Replacement  2885 Tramway Place – Replace Fence  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.          Are you Prepared for an Emergency?    An emergency isn’t necessarily a disaster, but is  defined as ǲan unforeseen combination of  circumstances or the resulting state that calls for  immediate action.ǳ Do you have important  documents and paperwork ready in case of such  emergency? If you don’t already have important  documents and papers together in a secured place,  it may be time to consider buying a fireproof safe  or file cabinet or even investing in a safe deposit  box. Documents to keep protected and have ready  in case of an emergency may include, but not  limited to:     Wills, social security cards, passports, birth  certificates, divorce and custody decrees,  immigration documents, death certificates     Property deed, plat plans, mortgage  company address and phone number and  signed agreements, homeowners and life  insurance policies and phone numbers,  copies of health insurance cards and phone  numbers     Health records, doctors and dentists names,  addresses and phone numbers     Auto ownership papers, auto insurance  policies and phone numbers, drivers and  auto license numbers     Credit card numbers, addresses and phone  numbers for outstanding loans     Stock and securities certificates, address  and phone number of broker, bank account  numbers, addresses and dates of residence     An extra copy of your address book,  complete with phone numbers and  addresses of friends, relatives and  professional resources.
