The major differences between  budgeted and actual amounts were in legal  expenses.    2018 Budget   After reviewing the proposed 2018 budget at its  January 10, 2018 meeting, the Board approved the  budget as proposed by the Finance Committee.   The Finance Committee developed the budget  based on the current and projected reserves and  the revenues needed to cover the services needed  by the property owners.   This allows for a reasonable targeted Net Income  of approximately -$1,500.00. Each year the income  and expenses will be reviewed to establish the  best course of action for the following years.   Budgets are projections which may change as the  year progresses, so please go to the Finance tab  on the Board section of the SHHA website for  current details.    Internal Review   Each year members of the Finance Committee  review the major financial procedures to ensure  they are being followed.   This past year members reviewed payroll,  QuickBooks, dues, petty cash, advertising, tram  passes, health insurance and security.   While there were no major issues noted, several  improvements were identified, especially in the  area of security.   Based on the reviews, the required annual report  was prepared and submitted to the Executive  Committee for review and acceptance by the  President.        3   The GRIT – March 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 3                                                                                                  Annual Report from the Secretary, Bob  Bower    Performed the following functions in accordance  with the Bylaws:   Oversaw the preparation and approval of the  monthly Board meeting minutes.

The CSC meets the first Tuesday of every month at  7:00 pm. Homeowners can attend, for the meeting  duration or any part thereof, but please notify the  SHHA Office beforehand.    Report:  There are many constraints as to what the CSC can  do. The covenants were written in the 1960-1970  timeframes and did not specifically address some of  the issues we face today. We are bound by what  your covenants permit.    There were 47 complaints handled by the CSC in  2017, including 5 carried over from 2016. All were  investigated by CSC members and recommendations  were made as to the validity of the complaints with  regard to the covenants relevant to their units. Of  these, 46 were closed in 2017.    Most were resolved between SHHA and the  homeowners. However, four were sent to the SHHA  attorney for further action, two carried over from  2016 and two from 2017. In one court case SHHA was  awarded attorney fees. SHHA has not recovered any  fees to date. However, a Claim of Lien was filed with  the County Clerk's office. This award establishes an  important precedent for future court actions.  The CSC published the following articles in The GRIT:  Jan. - Light Reminder; Trash Cans; Parking  Feb. - Covenants and Emerging Technologies  Mar. - Annual Report; Procedures to Amend Unit  Covenants  Apr. - Lighting; RV, Camper, and Boat Storage;  Procedures to Amend Unit Covenants  May. - Light Pollution   Jun. - Room Rentals; RV, Camper, and Boat  Storage  Jul. - Joint SHHA/SHS Statement on Outdoor  Lighting; Weeds and RV’s; Enforcement of  Covenants  Aug. - Room Rentals  Sep. - Q&A about Covenants  Oct. - What is a Single Family; Drones  Nov. - RV’s, Campers, and Boats; Weeds and  Landscaping; SHHA Is Not a Property Manager   Dec. - Trailers, Boats, RV’s and Commercial  Trucks; Parked Vehicles; Trash Cans    The CSC currently has nine members. They represent  a broad range of experience and are passionate  about enforcing the covenants and maintaining our  Sandia Heights values. We feel we can adequately  handle the workload with reasonable turnaround  times.
