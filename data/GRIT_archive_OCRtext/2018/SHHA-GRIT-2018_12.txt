One of the first responses to that signal was reactivation of the Community Services and Membership Committee  (CS&M)—a committee chartered in part to “improve the quality of life…for Sandia Heights residents.”  Sandia Heights Artists (SHA) represents a number of very talented artists who reside in our community, many  of whom are members of SHHA. One of their major events is an Annual Art Tour, which in September of this year  featured over 30 artists with a great variety of art displayed and for sale at the residences of several of the artists.  The public schools are a direct beneficiary of the work of this talented group, by way of a generous donation of a  portion of sales proceeds from the Annual Art Tour to Art in the School. One of the artists’ challenges is where to  store all the promotional materials related to the tour since the group does not have a permanent office. Lots of  scattered Sandia Heights artists’ garages and spare rooms have been serving that storage need.  Recently, thanks to some hard work by members of the SHHA Board, a secure off-site storage unit was  obtained for a large number of important but infrequently used materials being stored in the SHHA office. The  CS&M Committee saw the opportunity to create a win-win partnership and reached out to SHA to see if some of  their storage issues could be resolved through a collaborative arrangement. A memorandum of understanding  was created so that some of the artists’ storage concerns could be addressed through the newly acquired SHHA  offsite storage space. A small win, but a big improvement.  SHA President, Kathleen McCaughey, expressed appreciation on the artists’ behalf and noted that the  cooperative arrangement between SHA and SHHA was a great example of how, by working together, everyone  benefits.      Holiday Lighting & Parking Reminder  By Covenant Support Committee    The holiday season is here, and it is easy to get caught up in the festivities while you’re busy decorating the house  and baking goodies. Safety may be one of the last things on your mind. Please keep the following in mind:     Check your light sets for cracked insulation, frayed wires or damaged sockets. Any of these could cause short circuits.   Keep space heaters and candles away from trees (real or fake), wrapping paper, and curtains.   Avoid overloading circuits. Most home circuits can take 15 amps, or 1,800 watts.   Cover each outdoor plug and connector joint with plastic wrap to protect it from rain and seal it with electrical tape.  Some neighbors like to display outdoor lighting, big blow up snowmen, etc. If you live near such a person,  please be understanding that “this too shall pass.”  If you do put up lights, be considerate of your neighbors and  turn off the lights at an early hour, unplug blowup decorations’ blowers, and refrain from outside holiday music.  As fun and festive as holiday decorations are, please remember to take down outdoor decorations immediately  following the holiday.  If you plan on having a holiday party, think ahead about guest parking. Tell your guests not to park in or block  your neighbors’ driveways, not to park on their lawn, and not to block the road, as emergency vehicles may have  to get through. Consider inviting your neighbors to the party.   No matter what holiday you’re celebrating, the SHHA CSC is wishing a happy and safe holiday season to all.      3   The GRIT – December 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 12   Don’t Let Your Water Pipes Freeze  By Bob Bower, Architectural Control Committee Chair    It’s helpful this time of the year to remember ways to  protect your water pipes from the effects of very cold  weather. Most experts agree that steps need to be tak- en to protect water pipes if temperatures are expected  to drop below 21°F. A broken water pipe inside your  home can cause extensive and expensive damage!  Let’s start with the outside of your home. Disconnect  hoses and protect outdoor water faucets. Water that  freezes in hoses connected to faucets causes buildup  of pressure on interior plumbing that can result in a  rupture. Damage to interior pipes near an outdoor fau- cet is often difficult to repair due to their inaccessibility.  Disconnecting hoses from outdoor faucets and protect- ing faucets with hard foam insulating cups are good  ways to reduce the chances of damage to these water  pipes that extend through your walls. The inexpensive  foam cups are available at home improvement or  hardware stores and are easy to install. I’ve also found  it is wise to wrap outdoor faucets with some insulation  prior to placing the foam cup over the faucets, particu- larly if any of the faucets are on the north side of your  home or are in an area that does not receive winter  sun. Also, if you have any exterior water pipes exposed  to outside temperatures, you should consider using in- sulating tubes or heat tape around the exposed pipes.  Now, let’s consider the inside of your home. If Albu- querque experiences a spell of extremely cold weather  where temperatures, particularly at night, drop below  the 21°F “benchmark,” leave the water supply line on at  a very slow drip somewhere inside your home. Water  in slow motion is less likely to freeze than water that is  motionless. A faucet located far away from where the  water enters your home is the one you should use for  this purpose. The cost of water used is insignificant  compared to the cost of repairing damage caused by a  broken water line inside your home. Normally, these  very cold spells don’t last long so leaving an indoor  faucet dripping for a few days and nights should get  you through until warmer temperatures return. If you  are away from your home during the cold season,  make sure that there is adequate heat inside your  home to prevent internal pipes from freezing. Even  when trying to save energy costs, don’t turn the heat  too far down (experts recommend no lower than 55°F)  and don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you have  drained all of the water lines. I have seen the damage  caused by pipes not properly drained that have burst  inside a home where the heat has been turned off!    One final note for those with swamp coolers. If you  have not already done so, be sure to drain the water  reservoir and disconnect and drain the water supply  line. It doesn’t take much of a freeze to damage these  cooler components. Have a great winter!!  Living with Our Arroyos  By Bob Bower, Architectural Control Committee Chair    The 2,200 or so properties in our community cover  about 1,600 acres in the Sandia foothills, including  many arroyos, which were formed by the natural flow of  water due to significant elevation changes. Sandia  Heights’ developers elected to incorporate the arroyos  into the residential lots, so most of the arroyos became  part of the private property of our homeowners.  For many of the properties containing arroyos,  easements are clearly designated on the original plat  maps and on individual property surveys. These ease- ments were established by AMAFCA (Albuquerque  Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority) to guaran- tee the free and natural flow of water through the ar- royo system and to prevent unnecessary downstream  flooding from unregulated alteration of the arroyos.  AMAFCA owns and maintains the largest arroyos in  our community, namely, the concrete-channel arroyos  designated North and South Domingo Baca Arroyos.  So how do individual property owners manage their  property that includes arroyos designated as AMAFCA  easements? Both AMAFCA rules and SHHA unit cove- nants prohibit fencing or structures within the ease- ments, as those could impede flow. Also, AMAFCA  does not permit owners to build dams or other struc- tures within the arroyos that would alter the natural wa- ter flow.  The bottom line is that the arroyo portions of our  properties, though owned by the property owners, are  subject to easement restrictions, unit covenants, and  all County ordinances and laws related to trespassing  and other violations. You are free to clean the arroyo  portion of your property of dead brush and trash. If you  feel that heavy vegetation in the arroyo on your proper- ty poses a wildfire risk, then you should consider clear- ing or thinning it at your own effort and/or expense, suf- ficient to allay your fears of a wildfire in the arroyo.  GRIT and SHHA-website articles over the last few  months described our community as a classic wildland- urban interface based on its fire-favorable topography,  geography, biology, meteorology, and demography.  Note that there is no historical data to support the oc- currence of large wildfires affecting our arroyos or any  of the rest of our community. Significant alteration or  outright elimination of vegetation in the arroyos will like- ly have a detrimental impact on the natural flow chan- nels and on wildlife habitat and movement corridors.  Clear-cutting or excessive thinning of vegetation will  also cause erosion and the loss of the arroyos’ beauty.  Please make sensible decisions regarding how you  treat the arroyo portions of your property and keep in  mind that those arroyos and the wildlife and vegetation  that they support were there long before you built your  residence, and that their sustainability is critically im- portant to our foothill’s environment.  4   The GRIT – December 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 12                                                                                                     OCTOBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Photo by Ann Marie Allen    Free Vivaldi Concert  A free concert featuring the Vivaldi choral work, “Glo- ria,” is scheduled for Sunday December 23 at 11 AM at  The Church of the Good Shepherd, 7834 Tennyson NE.   The work features two soprano soloists, Ashley Dai- gle and Lydia Neal, accompanied by string quartet,  oboe, trumpet and organ. “It’s a beloved work,” said  Linda Gilmour, music director at the church. Composed  about 1715, “Gloria” breaks the liturgical text of the  Mass into 12 short movements. Vivaldi is well-known for  his concertos, but there was no evidence of his choral  works until manuscripts were discovered in the 1920s in  the National Library of Turin, Italy. Vivaldi wrote most  of his works for a Venice orphanage where he spent  many years as the master of violin.  In addition, Dorenda Morse (piano) and Patricia Oak- ley (organ) will play Advent and Christmas songs. “We  perform a cantata every December in late Advent,”  Gilmour said, “and each time the program takes on a  celebrative and meditative feel.”  Some Ways to Give Back  Looking for a way to serve you community during the  season of giving thanks and sharing?  You don’t have to  be a church member to help with the Justice and  Community Ministry at Church of the Good Shepherd,  United Church of Christ. The church, at 7834 Tennyson  Street NE, is raising money for food boxes for the East  Mountain Food Pantry in Tijeras. Jenny Sanchez leads  the Justice and Community Ministry. She says the pan- try provides food for around 130 families throughout  the year. A donation of $35 provides a meal for a family  of four. Checks can be made out to the East Mountain  Food Pantry and brought to the church, or donations  can be made on the pantry’s web site at  http://www.eastmountainfoodpantry.org.  Anyone who wants to help distribute food boxes on  every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday can call the  church at 505-856-1004.  The East Mountain Food Pantry is one of several pro- jects the Justice and Community Ministry at the Church  of the Good Shepherd supports.  Last September on the fifth Sunday of the month,  the church prepared and served meals to 225 individu- als at St. Martin’s Day Shelter. The next fifth Sunday is  December 30. Volunteers are always needed to help  prepare the meals at the church, transport them to the  shelter at 1201 Third St. NW, and serve the meals.  The church also participates in Albuquerque’s Family  Promise program by providing food and shelter at the  church for homeless families Friday through Sunday  twice a year. The next Family Promise weekend is in  February. Volunteers are needed to prepare and serve  meals and provide games for children.  Other opportunities involve providing groceries for  Casa Q, a shelter for young people who identify as  LGBTQ and have been forced out of their parents’  home. Volunteers buy and deliver groceries to Casa Q  weekly. The shelter teaches life skills and offers coun- seling to children and parents.   “We do a lot of feeding at Church of the Good  Shepherd,” Sanchez says. “This is just who we are.”        QR Code for social media  survey  8   The GRIT – December 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 12                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:  85 Juniper Hill Place – Remove and Replace Windows  147 Whitetail Road – Landscaping   171 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Driveway  204 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Windows and  Doors  241 Spring Creek Place – Roof and Stucco Repair  355 Live Oak Loop – Landscaping   448 Live Oak Loop – Garage Door Replacement  511 Roadrunner Lane – Restucco  646 Cougar Loop – Evaporative Cooler Replacement  633 Cougar Loop – Refinish Parapets  795-B Tramway Lane – Restucco   795-C Tramway Lane – HVAC Unit Replacement  795-M Tramway Lane – Refinish Exterior  1027 Tramway Lane – HVAC Unit Replacement  1062 Red Oaks Loop – Storage Facility   1188 Laurel Loop – Reroof   1571 Eagle Ridge Court – Landscaping   1710 Quail Run Court – Photovoltaic Panel Installation  2019 Quail Run Drive – Refinish Exterior  2146 Black Willow Drive – Restucco   2307 Calle de Rafael – Reroof  2324 Calle de Gabriel – Reroof   2829 Tramway Circle – Fence and Gate Replacement  2876 Brushwood Street – Replace Windows and Doors  9113 Lynx Loop – Photovoltaic Panel Installation  12713 Carmel Court – Landscaping  Visit the website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org to  read about all projects currently  under ACC management.             Tramway in Days Gone By  By Susan McCasland, Communications &  Publications Committee Chair    I was looking at Facebook posts and came across  this photo. It was taken in 1972 of northbound  Tramway. I think the photographer was a bit south  of Montgomery. The road is clearly mud. There are a  few homes visible—part of Glenwood Hills if my  placement of the photographer is correct. Our  foothills neighborhoods have changed a bit in the  last 46 years!    Derik Lattig / Albuquerque Memories          Trash Cans  This is the time of year when we  generate lots of trash. If there is too  much for your recycling bin, paper and  boxes can be taken to the Eagle Rock  transfer station (no charge for the  outside bin use) or places like the  Sonic/Lowes on Juan Tabo. Remember  that your trash bins need to be out of  sight except on the pick-up day.  9 The GRIT - December 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 12 10 The GRIT - December 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 12 11   The GRIT – December 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 12    Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
