Message from the President  By Woody Farber  As SHHA’s new team of Officers begins its term, we are focused on  expanding on the many accomplishments of the prior team of Officers, with  a much-expanded Board of Directors. The tremendous efforts of Joe Pappe  and his group of Officers are greatly appreciated, and we will continue to  strive to serve the needs of all Sandia Heights residents.  In order to serve the needs of all residents, we must identify what those  needs are, and who our residents are. The make-up of Sandia Heights has  changed over the years and our challenge is to serve the needs of a  changing population while not straying far from our Charter. The Strategic  Planning process at the Annual Meeting in February was the first step in a  long process necessary to accomplish this important goal.  The comments made by the participants during the numerous break-out  sessions are being gathered by the reconstituted Community Service &  Membership Committee under Hugh Prather as Chair. These ideas will be  analyzed and researched, and recommendations brought back to the Board  for appropriate action. As part of this process, a resident survey is being  developed, which will provide the Board with information as to the current  resident mixture and the important issues you wish the Association to  address.  The Board looks forward to serving all Sandia Heights residents over the  next year and encourages each of you to submit comments/concerns to us  through the office staff.

By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    In last month’s edition of The GRIT, I wrote an article  summarizing some useful information for Sandia  Heights residents to consider regarding methods to  protect their properties in the event of the occurrence  of a wildfire in or near our community.  I got this infor- mation at a meeting I attended in Tijeras in late Febru- ary on the subject of wildfire preparedness.  One of the  topics discussed at that meeting that I did not include  in my GRIT article was evacuation plans. As far as I  know, our community has never had any sort of evacu- ation plan for emergencies such as wildfires even  though it is considered to be a classic wildland-urban  interface.  Our community is comprised of about 2200  properties with fire-favorable topography, geography,  biology, meteorology, and demography.  To compli- cate matters, we have limited emergency egress with  choke-point entrances.  At its March meeting, the  Board approved the formation of a special committee  to develop an evacuation plan based on a presentation  on this issue by one of our residents.  The objective of  this committee is to create a SHHA-sponsored wildfire  preparation and response plan with the following spe- cific responsibilities:    • Task 1:  Create awareness of the problem and es- tablish a need for action by property owners.  • Task 2:  Develop a community notification and  evacuation plan  • Task 3:   Inform and support individual prepara- tion actions by community residents  • Task 4:  Obtain commitment of government re- sources and agencies    The committee will consist of members of the Board  and interested residents from the community. If you  have expertise and/or interest in any of the listed com- mittee tasks, please notify the SHHA office staff and  they will put you in touch with the appropriate point of  contact.  We estimate that the committee should com- plete the tasks within a few months of formal approval.      SPEEDING IN SANDIA HEIGHTS—AN  OBJECT LESSON  By Susan McCasland    Photo by Toni Schackel    On the morning of Thursday, March 29, a driver travel- ing west on San Rafael Ave., at a speed significantly  over the 20-mph limit, hit a speed bump on a curve and  lost control. The vehicle careened through a resident’s  front yard, snapped a tree off at ground level and  flipped against the garage, caving in the garage door  and front of the structure. There was property dam- age, but no one, including the driver, was injured. It  could easily have ended otherwise. Please think about  the speed you drive on our streets. Could this have hap- pened to you? Obey the posted limits and encourage  your neighbors and visitors to as well. Watch for walk- ers, cyclists, joggers, dog walkers, pram pushers, wild- life and the myriad other soft pink bodies that share  our roads with our hard metal cars and trucks.    3   The GRIT – May 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 5                                                                                                  AN ADDITIONAL CALL FOR  VOLUNTEERS  By Susan McCasland, C&P Committee Chair    The Publications and Communications Committee is  responsible for The GRIT, the annual Residents’  Guide and Directory, the SHHA website, the SHHA of- fice infrastructure, and any future methods for com- municating with our members and residents. It had  been without a chairperson for 11 months. I have vol- unteered for the chair position and was approved at  the April Board meeting. As of this writing, we have  three people interested in serving on this committee,  including myself. We probably need a couple more. If  you have an interest in writing, editing, layout,  webpage design, or directions SHHA could go with  social media, think about serving on this committee  then let the office know of your interest (san- diaheights@comcast.net).

Sandia Heights is a part of the unin- corporated area of Bernalillo County. Bernalillo  County Fire Marshal Keith Clark says, “This ban is nec- essary to reduce the risk of wildland fires, which pose  a threat to life, property, vegetation, and timber. The  county may issue additional resolutions if extreme or  severe drought conditions warrant those revisions.”  Other counties in New Mexico that have already lev- ied burn bans this fire season include Colfax County,  Lincoln County, and Curry County.  Stage 1 restrictions have been placed on the  Southwest Area (AZ, NM, OK, TX) by the U.S. Forest  Service. Baseline restrictions include:   Fireworks and incendiary devices are never allowed  on federal public lands.   National Parks, Monuments, and Wildlife Refuges  host year-round fire restrictions. Contact the Na- tional Park you plan to visit for specific restrictions.  More information on fire restriction stages can be found  at https://firerestrictions.us/stage/sw/stage-i/.     Campfires and recreational fires are prohibited. Heat- ing and cooking fires are banned except when using  UL listed appliances, cooking or heating devices  which use kerosene, white gas, or propane as a fuel  and only in an improved camping area that is cleared  of flammable vegetation for at least 30 feet and has  a water source.    Plan to celebrate this Memorial Day weekend?  Please keep the following in mind:   The use of fireworks is always prohibited in wildland  areas of Bernalillo County. Those areas include East  of Tramway Blvd. to the west face of the Sandia  Mountains and from San Antonio north to the Sandia  Indian Reservation.   The use of fireworks is always prohibited in Albuquer- que Open Space. This includes Elena Gallegos Open  Space and Picnic Area and Embudito Open Space.   To report someone using illegal fireworks, call 798- 7000 or to report a fire call 9-1-1.  4   The GRIT – May 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 5                                                                                                     WE ARE ACCEPTING ENTRIES FOR OUR  ANNUAL PHOTO CONTEST FOR THE 2019  SANDIA HEIGHTS RESIDENT GUIDE AND  DIRECTORY.

SHHA Needs Volunteers to Prepare for   Imminent Wildfire Threat  By Keith Julian and Bill Wiley, WPPC Co-chairs    As most of us are aware, New Mexico is facing what  could become the most devastating wildfire season in  recent history as a result of extreme drought, unusually  strong wind conditions, and abundant fire-fuels. Unfor- tunately, Sandia Heights is particularly vulnerable be- cause of our location in the “urban-wildland interface”  at the base of the Sandia Mountains, surrounded by  heavily-wooded Sandia Wilderness on one side and tin- der-dry grasslands of Sandia Pueblo on the other. As we  saw in the tragic wildfires that swept California a few  months ago (especially the urban-wildland communi- ties of Santa Rosa, Ventura, and Montecito), wildfire  can sweep rapidly down-canyon  and engulf entire neighbor- hoods in a matter of minutes  when driven by dry-wind condi- tions and “ember-leap.”     What can we do to prepare, pro- tect, and preserve ourselves,  our pets, our property, and the  special landscape of Sandia  Heights from this danger? Last  month the SHHA Board author- ized formation of a special (tem- porary) committee, the Wildfire  Preparedness Planning Commit- tee (WPPC), which has been given responsibility to de- velop a community preparedness strategy, with spe- cific plans to minimize the threat and potential damage  of wildfire in our neighborhoods (since we probably  cannot prevent a natural event like wildland fires from  occurring) and to facilitate the orderly and safe evacu- ation of residents and pets from the complicated net- work of roads in Sandia Heights, which have only five  escape outlets to safety on Tramway Blvd. The goal is  to have a series of emergency plans and resources de- veloped within the next few months which will mitigate  and respond to the threat of wildfire.    The WPPC needs interested and committed community  volunteers to serve on five designated task groups  which will develop the strategy and plans, with particu- lar need for dedicated Task Leaders; so far, we have the  following:      Co-Chairperson – Liaison and Communication  with Board and SHHA staff (Bill Wiley)   Co-Chairperson – Coordination of Task Leaders  and with External Resources (Keith Julian)   Task Group and Task Leader – Government  Agency Liaison (Charlie Bergman)   Task Group and Task Leader – Traffic and Evac- uation Plan (to be designated)   Task Group and Task Leader – Emergency Noti- fication/Warning Plan (to be designated)   Task Group and Task Leader – Individual Resi- dent and Community Preparation/Mitigation  Plan   Task Group and Task Leader – Post-fire Recov- ery and Environmental Restoration Plan    If you are concerned about the issue of wildfire prepar- edness for Sandia Heights or any of the topics being un- dertaken by these WPPC Task Groups,  please contact either of the co-chairs  (Keith  Julian  at  rkeithjul- ian@gmail.com  or  Bill  Wiley  at  nmtriman@aol.com) or SHHA office  staff at 797-7793.  The time commit- ment for volunteers would be limited  to a few hours over the next two  months; dedicated concern is the only  qualification needed to serve, either as  a Task Group Leader or member. Please  join us in this important endeavor for  our community’s safety and well-being.          Website Update in Progress  By the SHHA Office Staff    Have you been on our website lately? Notice anything  new? If you haven’t, head over to www.sandiahome- owners.org and check out the latest menu tab, Maps.  As it states, it is a work in progress; however, we have  already added a moderate amount of links to maps  that may be of interest to Sandia Heights residents  and their guests. We will continue to add these new  links to the SHHA website.  8   The GRIT – May 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 5                                                                                                       ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  20 Eagle Nest Court – Reroof  57 Spring Creek Drive – New Construction  100 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof, Restucco and Paint Ex- terior and Wrought Iron Railings  110 White Oaks Drive – Restucco  138 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Fence Installation  212 Spring Creek Place – Window Replacement  417 Live Oak Court – Reroof  449 Live Oak Loop – Photovoltaic Panel Installation  524 Live Oak Place – Reroof  542 Black Bear Loop – Restucco   552 Black Bear Road – Reroof   554 Black Bear Place – Window Replacement  577 Black Bear Road – Replace Evaporative Coolers  with A/C Units  1002 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  1027 Tramway Lane – Coyote Fence  1049 Red Oaks Loop – Gazebo Installation  1059 Red Oaks Loop – Landscaping  1715 Quail Run Court – Fence Installation  1805 Tramway Terrace Loop – Coyote Fence Repair  2005 Quail Run Drive – Stucco Repair and Install New  AC Unit  2024 Quail Run Drive – Windows and Door Replace- ment  2418 Tramway Terrace Court – Stucco Repair and Re- paint  2805 Tramway Circle – Fence Replacement  2865 Tramway Circle – Photovoltaic Panel Installation  8204 Indigo Court – Replace Evaporative Cooler with  A/C Unit  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.
