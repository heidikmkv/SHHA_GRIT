Credit for this article goes to JADE Enterprises, Inc., a lo- cal contractor with many years of experience in the de- sign and construction business here in the Albuquerque  area. It is well worth  reading. Know who you  are dealing with when  hiring a contractor—the  wrong one can cost you  lots of headaches and  money.  Many  homeowners  are choosing to remodel  their current homes ra- ther than purchase a new  one. But in order to cut  costs, some homeown- ers are hiring unlicensed  and uninsured contractors. These contractors can be- come a sizeable liability to the homeowner through  shoddy workmanship or even by failing to complete the  remodeling task. Keep in mind that contracting without  a license is illegal in New Mexico and hiring unlicensed  and uninsured contractors has had a strong negative im- pact on the local home remodeling industry.  There has been a recent rise of unlicensed individuals  entering the home remodeling market equipped with a  set of tools, a truck, and minor remodeling skills. They  deliver bids to the homeowner at prices too good to be  true! Unfortunately, many of these individuals end up  getting hired for the remodeling job. Remember the old  adage: “You get what you pay for.” This is very true for  the home remodeling industry. The use of low quality  materials and shoddy workmanship can go unnoticed  for months or years. The cost of redoing poor work can  be avoided by using some “up-front smarts” when  choosing the contractor in the first place.  The lack of proper insurance is one of the most obvi- ous and devastating ways construction costs are cut. If  a contractor should fall off the homeowner’s roof, use  faulty materials and methods, or damage the home- owner’s home or belongings, there is no coverage to  protect the homeowner. In these circumstances, the un- insured contractor cannot afford to pay for personal  injuries and other damages, leaving the homeowner  with an uncompleted project and significant costs to  settle claims against the homeowner’s insurance poli- cies.  If you have been the victim of unlicensed contracting  or would like more information on the topic, you can  visit the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Depart- ment’s Construction Industries Division website at  www.rld.state.nm.us/construction. Homeowners can  check an individual or company contractor’s license at  https://public.psiexams.com/search.jsp. Note: When hir- ing a general contractor, look for license number, liabil- ity coverage, and workers’ compensation. Also, the po- tential need for a builders’ risk policy should also be con- sidered. Don’t be afraid to ask for copies of these docu- ments to make sure they are up to date. In addition, ask  the contractor for a list of references from past projects.  Good luck with your home improvement projects.

If you do not wish your name and/or phone  number to be printed in the Directory you will be listed  as “Resident” and your phone number will not be dis- played. All changes must be received on or before Fri- day, October 26th, 2018, in order to be included in the  2019 Resident Guide and Directory.      2019 SHHA Resident Guide & Directory  Photo Contest    We are accepting entries for our annual photo contest  for the 2019 Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Direc- tory. Submissions are due to the SHHA office by Friday,  November 2, 2018. If you are the lucky winner, your  photo will be featured on the cover of the 2019 Resident  Guide and Directory and you will be acknowledged as  the photographer.      3   The GRIT – September 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 9  Bernalillo County Code   for Prohibited Uses in a   Single-Family Residential Zone  By the Covenant Support Committee    Bernalillo County Codes and Ordinances are often  more up-to-date and more restrictive than the Sandia  Heights Covenants, which in some instances were  written over 50 years ago. SHHA covenant com- plaints filed in our office cannot be acted upon by the  Covenant Support Committee (CSC) if there is not  specific language in that particular unit’s covenants  which prohibits the alleged violation. SHHA does not  own the covenants and cannot change them—only  the residents of a particular unit can change that  unit's covenants.  In such instances where Bernalillo County Codes  and Ordinances may apply, the CSC will refer the  homeowner to check the County for use restrictions.   For example, a few of the early covenants do cover  open storage on residential lots. The following is cop- ied from the Bernalillo County Code, Appendix A– Zoning, Section 9-R-1 Single Family Residential:  1. The following uses are prohibited in this zone:  a. The open storage of inoperable vehicles or  auto parts;  b. The open storage of trash or junk;  c. The open storage of large appliances;  d. Any use not designated a permissive use or  conditional use in this zone, unless otherwise  authorized by this Code; or  e. Any use not recognized as customarily inci- dental to a permitted use in the zone.  For more information  on County Codes and Ordi- nances, visit  www.bernco.gov and nav- igate to Codes and Ordi- nances, or to view the  most current version of  Code of Ordinances go to  https://library.municode.com/nm/berna- lillo_county/codes/code_of_ordinances.

The Wildfire Preparedness Planning Committee is  offering homeowner wildfire hazard assessments.  Wildfire Network, a 501(c)(3) organization, comes  to your street/neighborhood and walks a group of  neighbors around 5–10 properties, pointing out  risks and discussing ways to mitigate them for each  of the homes. Wildfire Network accepts tax-deduct- ible donations for this service. Check them out at                   www.wildfirenetwork.org.  Get to know your neighbors and protect your home  at the same time. Call SHHA Board member Judy  Durzo to help you arrange a neighborhood assess- ment: 797-8540.   5 The GRIT - September 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 9 6 The GRIT - September 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 9 7   The GRIT – September 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 9    Please Do Not Feed Wildlife    The Sandia Heights Homeowners office has received infor- mation that some residents are putting out table scraps,  corn and other food for our wildlife neighbors. Please  don’t. They are not pets. They are wild animals and should  forage like wild animals. Feeding them makes them look  for more food in our yards and trashcans. As Jan Randall  mentioned in a GRIT article last  October, feeding wild animals  creates a nuisance and a very  real danger. We have deer,  bobcats, coyotes and bears.  We are all safer and have an  easier time maintaining our  landscaping if these animals  are not counting on us for their  next meal. Deer may only eat  your garden. But bobcats and  coyotes have been known to  eat pets. And if you inadvert- ently get between a mama bear and her cub, you’ll quickly  learn why we don’t want bears cruising the roads during  the day looking for trashcans to plunder.  Also, you may think you are just feeding quail or rabbits,  but the larger animals are happy eating the corn and seeds  as well.   And if you need one more reason to refrain from feed- ing the wildlife, it is against New Mexico State law. For a  first offense, a game warden will issue a warning; if you  continue to feed, you will be issued a citation. The result is  a court hearing, with consequences of a $500 fine and/or  jail time.    The Shadow Knows  It may have been useful for  the crime-fighting hero  known as The Shadow to  lurk in the dark but wear- ing dark clothes and walk- ing at night on our dark  streets is an invitation to  disaster. Unless you are  tracking an archvillain, it is  much wiser to wear light  colors and carry a flashlight. Even better, for the grand sum  of $2 for SHHA members and $4 for non-members, you can  get a reflective vest at the SHHA office. Perhaps Lamont  Cranston wears one under his cape.    Keep Sandia Heights Looking Good    We need all of our residents’ help in keeping our commu- nity looking its best. Please do your part and remember to  • Pick up after you pet and dispose of the waste properly  • Pick up litter you notice in the community and dispose  of it. (And join our litter brigade beautifying Tramway on  September 29—see p. 3.)  • Make sure household trash is secured and disposed of  properly, including not putting trashcans out until the  day of pick up (see the article to the left).  Thank you for taking pride in the appearance of our com- munity. Your cooperation is appreciated!!    Herbs—Fragrant, Tasty & Beautiful    Patches of garden that seem to sprout nothing except  weeds should not be written off. “If you can’t grow any- thing else,” says gardening and food writer Sally Freeman,  “herbs are the answer.”   Ideally, there are three essentials for an herb garden:  good drainage, plenty of sunlight, and light soil enriched  with compost. Try to keep the garden away from trees as  the roots rob soil of moisture and nutrients.  You can also grow herbs in- doors. If your windows face  south, you should have ade- quate light for sun-loving herbs  such as dill, coriander/cilantro,  oregano, thyme and marjoram.  If your windows face other di- rections, you should be able to grow rosemary, sweet  woodruff or bay laurel in natural light. Place herb contain- ers far from radiators and other heat sources, preferably in  a room that is cool, moist and well ventilated.  Most herbs grow easily from seed, germinating in five  to seven days. There are exceptions. Lavender can take up  to a month to germinate. Rosemary is best propagated by  cuttings. French tarragon must be propagated by root di- vision. Parsley can be difficult to germinate, but Italian  parsley is easier to grow.  Compost is the fertilizer of choice because it won’t  burn tender roots. Enrich the compost pile by including  some weeds, especially dandelion, whose long roots bring  up minerals from deep in the soil. A layer of mulch con- serves moisture and suppresses weeds in summer.  Water herbs as soon as the soil feels dry. Rosemary, es- pecially, should never be allowed to dry out. You may need  to water every day. Your herbs will also appreciate a daily  misting.         8   The GRIT – September 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 9                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  96 Juniper Hill Road – Replace Door  119 Whitetail Drive – Replace Mailbox  216 Spring Creek Place – Shade Structure  309 Big Horn Ridge Road – Replace Garage Door  375 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Reroof   448 Live Oak Loop – Reroof  576 Black Bear Road – Refinish Exterior and Repave  Driveway  725-15 Tramway Vista Drive – Restucco  1114 San Rafael Avenue – Retaining Wall  1161 Laurel Loop – Window Replacement  1176 Laurel Place – Landscaping  1405 San Rafael Place – Shade Portal   1532 Eagle Ridge Drive – Fence Installation  1533 Eagle Ridge Drive – Sunroom Remodel  1861 Tramway Terrace Loop – Install 3 Pergolas  1919 Quail Run Drive – Seal Coat Driveway  2030 Quail Run Drive – Replace Portion of Block Wall  with a Wooden Fence and Deck Installation  2126 Globe Willow Avenue – Replace Windows  2135 Coyote Willow Avenue – Patio Cover  2317 Calle de Rafael – Seal Coat Driveway  2701 Tramway Circle – Cedar Fence Replacement  2876 Brushwood Street – Landscaping  7739 Cedar Canyon Road – Reroof   7740 Cedar Canyon Road – Reroof    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.                Stables Changing a Lot More   Than It’s [sic] Name  Historical item from Sept 6, 1979, SANDIA GRIT    Tramway Stables, formerly Sandia Peak Stables, is  undergoing a change in ownership, management,  and the name. The new operation embraces a  totally new philosophy. The new owners are  dedicated to creating an atmosphere at the stable  which is a wholesome and fun place for the entire  family as well as providing many new party and  entertaining ideas for residents. Well planned  breakfast rides, hamburger rides and cookouts, and  fall hay rides will provide residents with unique  entertaining opportunities appropriate to the  uniqueness of Sandia Heights.  The stable provides horse rental and excellent  informal riding lessons. Much effort is being  expended to upgrade and improve the quality of  the boarding facilities available for horse owners.  The new owners are very eager to provide  satisfactory services to residents and urge residents  to try out the new services and party opportunities  during the upcoming beautiful fall season. With  State Fair approaching, why not try out those new  western outfits on a real live horse!
