    Pay It Forward  By Hugh Prather, Nominating Committee Chair    In 2019, starting with the SHHA Annual Meeting, several Board of Director  terms will expire. Those positions need to be filled by new members who  share the same dedication and commitment to the Sandia Heights  community as those completing their service.   The perspectives new Board members bring to Board service is an  energizing and vital component of helping to keep the SHHA focused on  serving its members and its mission of maintaining the quality of life for all  residents in our community. Service as a member of the Board of Directors  “pays it forward” and helps assure that Sandia Heights ten years from now  will still retain the luster it holds today.  Board members must be property owners in Sandia Heights and belong  to the SHHA. The shifting demographics of our community with more  younger families with children becoming residents suggests the need for  more representation from that segment of our community on the Board.  However, anyone interested in “paying it forward” is welcome to apply.  Board service requires attending the monthly Board of Directors  meeting and service on one standing committee. In aggregate, serving on  the Board of Directors requires a commitment of 3–5 hours a month. The  process for having your name placed in nomination for a term on the  Board is very simple. Inquiries about nomination to the Board, submission  of Statements of Interest, and related matters should be submitted to the  Office.

Each year the drought continues makes such a fire more likely. Just this summer, we have had three electrical  fires along Tramway and a large construction-related fire in High Desert. We are told that should a fire get started  in the arroyos, the fire could travel more than a mile in less than 15 minutes, in part because our arroyos are so  choked with vegetation, both dead and alive. This lower-growing fuel provides a “ladder” to the taller trees and to  your rooftops.    In October, SHHA is planning a trial run to reduce the fuel load in the arroyos using a technique called  “goatscaping” in a limited area of Domingo Baca Arroyo as a possible method of accomplishing the goal of  protecting homeowners from a catastrophic fire. We are inviting a few homeowners whose property abuts or  includes the arroyo to participate in this trial.  It will not cost you any money, it will help to reduce wildfire risk to  your property, and it could be a lot of fun.  (You might find yourself humming “The Lonely Goatherd” from Sound  of Music.)  Specifically, homeowners whose property abuts or includes either Piño Arroyo or Domingo Baca Channel are  encouraged to contact Judy Durzo at jdurzo@mac.com to discuss and express your opinion. (Judy’s cell is 350-6271)    GOATSCAPING    Goats can be used to effectively reduce fire fuel by providing bio remediation and general land improvement and  maintenance! A herd of 60 goats can clear about an acre of land per day. This natural clean-up crew can help prepare  for next spring’s growing season by reducing this summer’s growth. Goats love to eat chamisa, cholla, grasses,  dried gourds, elms, tamarisk and just about everything we have in the arroyos. They do not enjoy wildflowers or  sacred datura. In colder weather, they will prune low-growing juniper, which also provides a ladder to taller trees.  Material not consumed and composted by the goats is broken up and pressed into the ground, creating a natural  transition to a balanced environment. Hungry goats are a low-tech, but effective approach to weed abatement, fire  prevention and allergy management!  Portable solar electric fencing, a horseback handler and herd dogs are used to keep the goats within a particular  area and out of other trouble. This targeted approach allows landscaping and other plantings to be trimmed a little,  or not at all. The goats and their handler camp on site until the project is completed. Protector dogs (like Great  Pyrenees) or llamas keep the goats safe from predators.  We have chosen Horned Locust Goatscaping out of Cerrillos, New Mexico, to do the trial. This group has worked  extensively at El Dorado and in the Santa Fe area generally and they have travelled the state using their goats as  groundskeepers at solar arrays and other sites. And they are nice people who enjoy their work and don't mind  observers who also like to pet dogs and goats.

They tend to the landscape and  reduce fire hazards through the consumption of weeds, shrubs, invasive and problematic overgrowth. While  they do not eat dead bushes, the goats break them down to get to live plants.        Daylight Saving Time ends on Sunday,  November 4, 2018 at 2:00 AM.  “Fall back” by  setting your clocks back one hour.                Have you voted yet?    In-person early voting began on October 20th and con- tinues until November 3rd. Election Day is Tuesday, No- vember 6th. In New Mexico, all polls are open on Elec- tion Day from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM Mountain Time. An  individual who is in line at the time polls close must be  allowed to vote. New Mexico law allows employees  whose workday begins within two (2) hours of the polls  opening and ends less than (3) hours before polls close  are entitled to up to two (2) paid hours of leave to vote.  The employer can set the time for leave to vote.  4   The GRIT – November 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 11                                                                                                     SEPTEMBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Residents  are advised to  take your out- going mail to the Post Office. If the option is available it  might be best to have sensitive information like checks,  insurance and mortgage papers sent to your bank  branch and you can pick them up from there, rather  than having them sent to your house. Likewise, consid- er opening a post office box and have your mail sent  there. Otherwise, keep your eye out for the postman  and get your mail out of your box quickly.     Would you like to see your mail before it arrives? In- formed Delivery by USPS will email you greyscale pic- tures of the exterior of letter-size mail pieces scheduled  to arrive soon. Best of all, it’s FREE! For more infor- mation visit  https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/star t.action.    Another alternative is to replace your mailbox with  either a heavy-duty locking type or totally enclose the  box with acceptable construction and a lock to impede  vandals as well as thieves. Just remember to submit an  ACC application to SHHA before beginning work, as well  as checking mailbox guidelines at  https://www.usps.com/manage/mailboxes.htm    If you experience mail theft, notify the BCSO (798- 7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876-2455), and Sandia  Heights Security (856-6347 or mobile number 263- 4654). If you witness a crime in progress, notify BCSO.   Sandia Heights Reminiscences  By Robert Trucksa, SHHA member   and long-time resident    In 1970, only Tramway Boulevard north of Montgom- ery and Tramway Road were paved. Paseo del Norte  was a dirt road called Los Angeles. Likewise, Tramway  south of Montgomery to I-40 was dirt.  While stationed at what was then Sandia Base (now  Kirtland Air Force Base), I had a small motorcycle. I  would take it to where we now live and “dirt bike.”  Then, Sandia Heights only had houses on what are  now Units 1, 6, and 7, and almost all had been sold.  When I asked a realtor if there was any property I  could buy south of there, he told me that all of that  land was Indian reservation. Hence, I bought a lot to  build on. Two weeks later, as I rode my bike, bulldozers  were cutting roads into the “Indian reservation.”  When I then inquired with a different realtor, I was told  that all of the lots in what are now Units 2 and 5 had  been bought by developers. One developer planned to  put in a row of town houses. The other developers  complained and a lot came available. I bought it!  I grew up on the south side of Chicago. I found San- dia Heights to be heaven. No street lights—at night I  could see the stars. No lawn to mow—just what  Mother Nature grew.   As other houses sprang up near mine, I got to know  my neighbors. The cartoonist of “Bloom County,”  Berkeley Breathed, once lived next door.  My wife and I could walk the streets for an evening  stroll. There were no “blocks” as in town—just crazy  groups. Each house being different is a rare thing.  Throughout my life I have lived in so many places. I  have never regretted wanting to live here in Sandia  Heights.      8   The GRIT – November 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 11                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:  40 Cedar Hill Place – Deck Replacement  58 Juniper Hill Court – Deck Replacement  69 Pinon Hill Place – Restucco  76 Pinon Hill Place – Reroof   85 Juniper Hill Place – Restucco  163 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  203 Big Horn Ridge Road – New Construction  344 White Oaks Drive – Hot Tub Installation  378 Juniper Hill Road – New Construction  379 Juniper Hill Road – Restucco  422 Live Oak Court – Photovoltaic Panel Installation  619 Cedar Hill Road – Reroof  668 Blackhawk Drive – Reroof  697 Bluebird Lane – Replace Windows/Doors and  Landscaping  726-32 Tramway Vista Loop – Window Installation,  Replace Windows, Reroof Garage, Paint Garage Doors  and Trim and Landscaping  785-1 Tramway Lane – Door Replacement  808 Tramway Lane – Refinish Exterior Trim  938 Bobcat Blvd. – Hot Tub Installation  969 Antelope Avenue – Fence Enclosure  1052 Red Oaks Loop – Reroof  1101 San Rafael Avenue – Replace Window  1228 Rockrose Road – Restucco   1412 Bluebell Place – Bedroom Remodel  1529 Eagle Ridge Drive – Remodel Pool Area, Gazebo  Installation and Landscaping  1542 Eagle Ridge Place – Backyard Wall Extension  1838 Tramway Terrace Loop – Repaint Stucco  1911 Quail Run Road – Reroof  1929 Quail Run Drive – Install Ductless Heating System  2182 Cattail Willow Avenue – Reroof  2301 Calle de Rafael – Repair and Repaint Stucco  2303 Calle de Rafael – Repaint Stucco  2833 Tramway Circle – Restucco  2893 Tramway Place – Photovoltaic Panel Installation  7732 Cedar Canyon Road – Replace Window and Doors  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.    Our Backyard Antenna Farm  By Susan McCasland, Communications &  Publications Committee Chair    Ever wonder about all those antennas on Sandia  Crest? Turns out it is one of the most crowded  electronic sites in the world! It is home to the  broadcast antennas for numerous Albuquerque- area television and AM/FM radio stations, many  commercial two-way radio repeaters, weather  radars, electric utility radio systems, Forest Service  radios, military base services, other long-distance  carriers, and several local governments’ networks,  including public safety and emergency medical  services. Whew!  The antennas extend for roughly a half mile.  Because they are on a natural 4,500 foot “mast,”  the towers are not particularly tall.  The first towers went up in 1953 and belonged to  KOB-TV (Channel 4) and KGGM-TV (Channel 13).  Take a drive up Sandia Crest Road on the east  side to see the antenna farm up close and maybe  do a bit of hiking while there.    9 The GRIT - November 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 11 10 The GRIT - November 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 11 11   The GRIT – November 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 11     Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
