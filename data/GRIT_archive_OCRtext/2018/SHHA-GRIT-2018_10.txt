    Service to Members Just Keeps Getting Better—  Voter Registration  Hugh Prather, Community Services & Membership Committee Chair    The member survey SHHA conducted earlier this year indicated a desire for  a more effective homeowners association. Bringing new services to  members is one way to make the association more effective.   As an outcome of that analysis, SHHA is now proud to announce a new  service to all members: Voter Registration at the SHHA office on San Rafael.  Both SHHA staff members, Betsy Rodriguez and Jessica Seeley, have  received voter registrar training at the Bernalillo County Clerk’s office and  are now official third-party voter registration agents. This service is  nonpartisan and is available to any member of the SHHA. By using our third- party registration agents you do not have to make the trip to the county  clerk’s office to register; you can do it right here in your neighborhood.  The last date to register and be eligible to vote in the November 2018  election is October 9. If you have not registered and wish to do so, please  stop by and see either Jessica or Betsy on or before October 9th so you can  cast your ballot in the 2018 general election!

This  is not a new issue within our community, and at times  becomes a major irritant for other residents.  Although  the published covenants for the earliest developed units  do not specifically spell out RVs, the Second Judicial  Court in the late 1990s determined long-term parking of  RVs, camper trailers and boats on all residential lots in  Sandia Heights is prohibited. The court allowed parking  of such vehicles for a period of no more than 48 hours  for maintenance and provisioning.        The CSC does not police the neighborhood for vio- lations; however, if a complaint is received, your home- owners association and the CSC will act upon it with the  full authority and backing of the judicial system. We ask  all residents with RVs, travel trailers and boats to be  good neighbors, respect the rights of other residents  and adhere to the covenants. Please keep in mind that  the covenants are here to ensure we can continue to live  in a pleasant community and maintain the value in our  homes.                      2019 SHHA Resident Guide & Directory  Deadline is Quickly Approaching    Please check your alphabetical listing as well as your nu- merical listing in the 2018 Resident Guide and Directory  and let the SHHA office know if you have any changes or  additions. If you do not wish your name and/or phone  number to be printed in the Directory, you will be listed  as “Resident” and your phone number will not be dis- played. All changes must be received on or before Fri- day, October 26th, 2018, in order to be included in the  2019 Resident Guide and Directory.    KUDOS and THANKS!!!  By Jan Randall, SHHA Member    Have you noticed the difference in the amounts of litter  along the shoulders of Tramway from Montgomery  through the 3-way stop near County Line?  From Mont- gomery to the southern border of High Desert, the litter  is considerable and tacky.  From High Desert to the  southern border of Sandia Heights, there is less lit- ter.  And from Simms Park to beyond the 3-way stop,  there is still less litter.  The reason that our shoulders  along Tramway and the eastern part of Paseo del Norte  are tidy is because there is one neighbor who makes the  effort to pick up trash along our roadways every  week.  He obviously cares about the appearance of the  neighborhood, which indirectly affects our property val- ues and sales.  While I know that one of the Association’s  committees has recently accepted the responsibility of  a semi-annual litter cleaning of a mile from the southern  Sandia Heights boundary to Paseo, I have yet to see any  other person picking up trash.  Bob Bower is our good  neighbor.  Should you see him or know him, please  thank him.  Bucket and grabber in hand, Bob has for  many, many months been along Tramway and eastern  Paseo removing trash.                    Sandia Heights Resident  Found in a bedroom. Photographed in a jar.

Please don’t kill  them.    3   The GRIT – October 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 10   Wildfire Preparedness:  The “Go Bag”  By the Wildfire Preparedness Planning Committee    You are lying in bed asleep when suddenly your phone  sounds. It is the Nixel alert system or the Bernalillo  County Emergency Alert System (that you signed up  for using info on the SHHA web page). A brush fire has  broken out in the open space behind Sandia Heights,  and you are advised to evacuate. Smoke is already fill- ing the air and outside you see flames in the distance.  What critical items can you grab in the 5–10 minutes  before you evacuate?  To prepare for such a situation, many emergency  agencies recommend each household prepare a “go  bag.” Again, refer to the SHHA web page for two arti- cles that suggest items to include in one or more back- packs. One article is entitled “Creating a Go Bag.” A  Bernalillo County handout entitled “How to be Pre- pared for an Emergency” also contains a section on  what to include in a “home readiness kit.”  However, some of these items may be used fre- quently and would be inconvenient to store in your to- go backpack. In this case, a written list of these items to  collect would help ensure nothing is left behind. This list  can be kept in the backpack for easy, and easily found,  reference.  How often have you gone on a trip and halfway  there discovered you forgot to pack something im- portant like your reading glasses or a critical medica- tion? In a wildfire evacuation, when you are not think- ing clearly, you may not be able to recover forgotten  items—such as insurance documents, a Rolodex with  critical phone numbers, your pet’s meds and vaccina- tion records. This is in addition to the standard recom- mendations such as clothing, food for three days, a  first aid kit, an emergency radio, and flashlight. Each  household’s go bag would be specific for its members.  Therefore, a useful exercise would be to sit down as a  family and prepare the list. Teenagers may consider  things critical that parents would omit and vice versa.  All family members should be familiar with where all  items are stored.  The creation of family and even individual go bags  is an easy way to reduce somewhat the stress of what  is sure to be a very bad day.                     .FREE SHREDDING  1st Monday of each month  9:00 AM – 3:30 PM  @  Unicor, LLC.  1615 Broadway Blvd. NE  Albuquerque, NM 87121  505-843-7283  505-843-7600  info@unicorllc.com  (No limit on size or amount)        New Neighbors Soon  By the Communications & Publications Committee    There are two new developments being built in our  neighborhood at the moment. Many of you have no- ticed the construction and asked what is coming in.  The larger one is Hawks Landing on the east side of  Tramway across from the end of Paseo del Norte. It  will comprise 33±2 single-family homes. It is not part  of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, at  this time.    The smaller one is called Las Pradas. It is on the  northeast corner of Tramway and San Rafael. Las Pra- das will consist of eight single-family homes. It will be  part of SHHA’s South Unit 16. If you want to see a plat  of the developments, stop by the SHHA Office and  pick up one of each.  We might wish for the empty lots to be open space  forever, but the owners of those lots want to see a re- turn on their investment. So now we’ll have new  neighbors to welcome into the community.  4   The GRIT – October 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 10                                                                                                     AUGUST CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Sandia Heights’ Beautiful, Dark Skies  By Susan McCasland, C&P Committee Chair    The absence of street lights and the restrictions on  lighting for individual properties leads to one  particularly beautiful result—dark skies. The ability to  see the Milky Way has become a rarity in our  illuminated world. Here are a few words from the  International Dark Sky Association:  The nighttime environment is a precious natural  resource for all life on Earth, but the glow of  uncontrolled outdoor lighting has hidden the stars  and changed our perception of the night.  The natural night sky inspires. Until recently, for all  of human history, our ancestors experienced a sky  brimming with stars—a night sky that inspired  science, religion, philosophy, art and literature,  including some of Shakespeare’s most famous  sonnets.  The natural night sky is our common and universal  heritage, yet it’s rapidly becoming unknown to the  newest generations.  Van Gogh painted his famous “Starry Night” in  Saint Rémy, France, in 1889. Now, the Milky Way can  no longer be seen from there. If he were alive today,  would he still be inspired to paint “Starry Night”?  Experiencing the night sky provides perspective,  inspiration, and leads us to reflect on our humanity  and place in the universe. The history of scientific  discovery and even human curiosity itself is indebted  to the natural night sky.    Without the natural night sky, we could not have:  •  Navigated the globe  •  Walked on the Moon  •  Learned of our expanding universe  •  Discovered that humans are made of stardust    We should be thankful our community is doing its  part to protect our dark night skies.      9 The GRIT - October 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 10 10 The GRIT - October 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 10 11   The GRIT – October 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 10     Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    Community Event Bulletin Board   None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
