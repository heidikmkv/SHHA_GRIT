WATER CONSERVATION AND RESTRICTIONS  Bernalillo County Water Restrictions  Bernalillo County Ordinance Article VII Water Conservation Requirements  Section 30-247 Outdoor Watering Restrictions states the following:  …Beginning April 1, 2018 through October 31, 2018 spray/sprinkler irrigation is not allowed between the hours of 11 am and 7 pm. This  restriction shall not apply to drip irrigation and low precipitation  bubblers, hand watering, or watering of containerized plants and plant  stock.  To read the ordinance in its entirety, please visit:  https://library.municode.com/nm/bernalillo_county/codes/code_of_ordinances ?nodeId=BECOCO_CH30EN_ARTVIIWACORE_S30-247OUWARE  Runoff onto adjacent properties or public  rights-of-way is considered to be water  waste. To report time-of-day and water waste  violations, please contact the Bernalillo  County Water Waste Hotline at 224-2100.   Tips to help conserve water within your home:  • Turn the water off while shaving or brushing your teeth and when washing your hands while you lather. • Take short showers that use less water instead of tub baths. • Instead of using water to defrost frozen foods, thaw foods in the refrigerator overnight. • Compost food waste instead of using the garbage disposal. • Purchase a timer for sprinklers or hose to avoid over watering. • Sweep to clean driveways and entryways rather than hosing them off. • Collect rainwater to use on landscaping. The County offers a free rain barrel incentive program for residents in the  unincorporated areas of Bernalillo County. The application is available at  https://www.bernco.gov/water or by clicking here. Some restrictions do  apply. Also offered is the High-Efficiency Toilet Retrofit Incentive Program  that offers Bernalillo County residents up to two free high-efficiency toilets  (1.28 gallons-per-flush), installed by a licensed plumber. The application is  available at https://www.bernco.gov/water or by clicking here.  Some  restrictions do apply.

Those areas  include East of Tramway Blvd. to  the west face of the Sandia  Mountains and from San Antonio north to the Sandia In- dian Reservation.  The use of fireworks is always prohibited in Albu- querque Open Space. This includes but is not limited to  Elena Gallegos Open Space and Picnic Area and Embudito  Open Space.  Fireworks and incendiary devices are never allowed  on federal public lands.  The sale, use, and possession of aerial type fireworks,  missile-type rockets, helicopters, aerial spinners, stick- type rockets, and ground audible devices are still illegal  within the unincorporated areas of Bernalillo County. Un- incorporated Bernalillo County is the geographic area  outside the city limits of Albuquerque.  To report use of illegal fireworks, call Bernalillo  County Sherriff at 798-7000. To report a fire call 9-1-1.  Violators who are cited for open burning restrictions  could face fines up to $300 and/or 90 days in jail. For fire- works violators, fines are up to $1,000 and/or one year in  jail. If it is determined that the use of fireworks was the  cause of a fire that damaged property, the responsible in- dividual may be held liable for those damages. The Berna- lillo County Fire-Protection Ordinance will be strictly en- forced by BernCo Sheriff's Office, Fire Department, and  SHS Security Services. DEAD TREE CUTTING & REMOVAL By Parks & Safety Committee (updated from a July  2013 article by Suzanne Schneider)  Do you or a nearby neighbor have a DEAD TREE or  SHRUB in your yard(s) or on nearby County right-of-way?  The problem has increased dramatically this last year  because of the prolonged drought and bark beetles at- tacking live and/or dying conifer trees. Many of us have  not remembered to do regular DEEP ROOT watering of  our plants on a frequent basis, year-round to keep  them from dying or attracting bark-beetles.  So, what should we do now in 2018?  First, go back to or  continue to do deep root watering all of your plants. And,  second, consider removing any dead trees and shrubs be- cause they are potential FIRE HAZARDS and/or lability  concerns!!  Articles over the past year or two about NM  fires indicate that removing trees and shrubs around resi- dences is very important in preventing wild fires.  If you  cannot cut and remove your dead trees and shrubs your- self, look at the following list of Contractors that have  agreed to give Sandia Heights residents a discount to  cut and remove trees & shrubs this summer. If the  dead or dying plants are on County rights-of-way adja- cent to your property, call the County Hotline at 848- 1503 and put in a work request with them to remove  trees, shrubs, and/or Chamisa on the road rights-of-way  adjacent to your property.  Taking care of your dead and/or living landscaping  this summer & fall will help maintain our property val- ues and make Sandia Heights a nicer place in which to  live.  Remember also that SOME Sandia Heights Unit  Covenants require prompt removal of DEAD trees and  shrubs. You might just save yourself some Covenant Vio- lation headaches or liability issues if you contact any of  these contractors now and get your dead or dying trees  & large shrubs removed in the next few months.  As dry  as it is, you might also have liability in a case where a fire  starts on or crosses your property and spreads to your  neighbor’s property. This is the first of many communica- tions you will see from SHHA about clearing dead brush  and cutting dead trees to prevent SERIOUS fires in our  area this year.  Contractors contacted and agreeing to  discounts are listed below:  • Kiki Tree Service- 10% disc. 505- 385-6926 • Rick's Tree Trimming & removal- 15% disc. 505-480-4200 rickp505@msn.com • Robert's Tree Service-15% disc. 505-489-5169 • NM Landscaping-15% disc.

YES, IT’S DRY!! By Susan McCasland, C&P Committee  This small brush fire occurred at Tramway and San Rafael  around sunset on Cinco de Mayo.    3   The GRIT – June 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 6                                                                                                  SUMMER IS HERE  By the Covenant Support Committee (CSC)      Summer is here. Unfortunately, also returning are  the boats and RVs.  When you bought or rented in  Sandia Heights you agreed to follow your Unit cov- enants which have restrictions on parking your rec- reational vehicles on your lot.  SHHA does not look  for violations, but rather investigates complaints  submitted by your neighbors whose names are not  divulged.  After investigation, if there is a violation,  you will receive a letter asking you to correct the  problem. Below is a list of local storage facilities that  will store RVs, boats, campers, and trailers:    A Class RV Storage (2 locations)  7950 Jacs Lane NE   505-400-7260            &  900 Osuna NE  505-453-9778    Coronado Plus Storage  9320 San Pedro Dr. NE   505-821-0442    Far North Storage  5604 Carnuel Ave. NE.  505-821- 4402                        SANDIA HEIGHTS LIGHTING  By the Covenant Support Committee (CSC)    Among the many pleasures of residing in Sandia  Heights are the dark skies which allow stargazing,  watching the moon rise over the mountains and en- joying the distant sparkling night lights of Albuquer- que. These activities are possible in large part be- cause of the light regulations of both Bernalillo  County and our Sandia Heights Unit Covenants.    Per the North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia  Heights Light Pollution Ordinance of the Bernalillo  County Code, all exterior light fixtures shall be  aimable, shielded fixtures so that excessive light  does not cross into adjacent properties, equipped  with motion sensors or automatic timing devices,  and remain off between 11:00 p.m. and sunrise ex- cept for illuminating walkways or driveways. More  detailed information can be found at:   https://library.municode.com/nm/bernalillo_county/ codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=BECOCO_CH30E N_ARTVILIPO_DIV2OULIFINOALACSAHEAR  The various Unit Covenants may have different  wording, but all are trying to accomplish the same  purpose: minimizing the effects of outdoor lighting  on one’s neighbors. Covenant documents for each  Unit may be found at:   http://sandiahomeowners.com/unit-covenants.    When planning new or assessing your current out- door lighting, in addition to consulting the above  regulations, think about what impact your lighting  will have upon your neighbors. Will it shine into their  windows or onto their patio? A little consideration  can avoid a complaint to the Covenant Support  Committee and/or to Bernalillo County. We have a  wonderful, unique neighborhood—let’s keep it that  way!

One of the first orders of business is follow-up  on all the great ideas generated at the February SHHA  Annual Meeting. With over 100 Sandia Heights resi- dents participating in February, 6 different small  groups generated ideas about ways to improve our  community. Those ideas were recorded and are being  studied.  The CS&M has reviewed all those ideas and is put- ting together a survey incorporating the suggestions  from the Annual Meeting. The intent of the survey will  be to share those ideas with the entire Sandia Heights  community so the SHHA can develop plans to better  serve the needs of the entire community. The survey  will be sent out by email to all SHHA members with an  email account at our office and there will be opportuni- ties for all members who don’t have email to take the  survey at the SHHA office. Look for this opportunity to  express your personal opinion about our community  needs sometime in early June.    THE GRIT IN LIVING COLOR  By Susan McCasland, C&PC Chair    Did you know that you can read The GRIT in glori- ous full color? It is always available at the SHHA web- site, including a few years of archives. But you don’t  have to remember when the new GRIT is due out. Give  the office staff your email address and they’ll send you  a link every month when the new GRIT is ready.  In addition, you will receive occasional email alerts  about items of community interest. Call or email the  office now and let your inner peacock delight!

They didn’t eat all winter, and they  are hungry! We want to keep our dwindling population  of bears in the Sandias wild, and the only way to ensure  that they stay wild is by not having anything on our  property that would attract them. This means:  •  Keeping garbage containers in a sturdy building  or in an approved bear-resistant trash receptacle  and not putting it out until the morning of trash  pickup  •  Bringing bird feeders inside at night (or stop  feeding the birds during the time bears are active,  usually April through mid-November)  •  Feeding pets indoors, as well as storing pet food  and extra bird seed inside the house or garage  •  Picking up fallen fruits from trees and plants  •  Keeping doors and windows closed and locked af- ter sunset.  •  Keep barbeques clean and grease free  “People who live in  bear habitat have a  responsibility to the  wildlife whose hab- itat they are shar- ing. Feeding bears,  whether intentional  or not, can amount  to a death sentence  for the animal.” -Sandia Mountain Bear Watch  When NM Game and Fish removes bears from the  Sandias, the majority of those are usually killed. These  bears’ only crime was taking advantage of food left  easily available by humans. Trapping and relocation  sounds like it would work, but it doesn’t. Ultimately, if  the relocated bear isn’t killed by a dominant bear in the  new territory, they use their unerring homing sense to  try to come back to the home territory and often these  bears are killed by cars as they try to make their way  home. The problem doesn’t stop with one relocation if  people persist in feeding bears with garbage and bird  feeders, whether intentional or not. Another bear or  other wildlife will continue to return to where there is  food. Please do your part to co-exist with our wildlife.  Remember, this was their home long before it was de- veloped for our homes.      8   The GRIT – June 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 6                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  50 Rock Ridge Drive – Reroof  216 Spring Creek Place – Landscaping  226 Spring Creek Lane – New Construction  547 Black Bear Loop – Landscaping  650 Cougar Loop – Backyard Enclosure and Landscap- ing  682 Blackhawk Drive – Re-stucco  711-23 Tramway Place – Window Replacement  711-36 Tramway Place – Exterior Light Fixture Re- placement  727-5 Cedar Hill Lane – Re-stucco  750 Tramway Lane – Wall and Fence Installation  795-O Tramway Lane – Reroof  801 Tramway Lane – Tree Replacement  950 Deer Drive – Reroof  985 Lynx Loop – Landscaping and Window and Door  Replacement  1108 San Rafael Avenue – Raised Garden Beds  1429 San Rafael Avenue – Landscaping  1563 Eagle Ridge Court – Exterior Refinishing  1699 Quail Run Court – Exterior Refinishing  1701 Quail Run Court – Mailbox Replacement  1875 San Bernardino Avenue – Reroof  2019 Quail Run Drive – Mailbox Replacement  2026 Quail Run Drive – Window Replacement and Re- stucco  2443 Tramway Terrace Court – Exterior Refinishing and   Replace Windows/Doors   2883 Tramway Place – Reroof  9105 Lynx Loop – Deck Installation  12617 Colony Place – Landscaping and Exterior Refin- ishing  12617 Colony Place – Replace Evaporative Cooler and  Furnace  12625 Carmel Court – Replace or Resurface Concrete  Driveway  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC manage- ment.    TIPS ON DRAINING SWIMMING  POOLS, ETC.  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    If you have a swimming pool, a large outdoor pond  or fountain, or a hot tub that needs to be periodical- ly drained, the following tips may be useful:  If you have a septic system, you should not put  any of the wastewater from your water features  directly into the septic tank. A large discharge of  water into your septic tank may overload it and  cause a partial or total failure of the septic system.   You should also avoid discharging wastewater near  any part of the septic system’s drain field since the  discharge, particularly a very large one, may satu- rate the field and reduce its ability to handle the  normal septic tank discharge into the field.  The County has no specific ordinances that ad- dress the discharge of water from a pool or other  large water features. It is recommended that the  water be discharged in a place that will not affect  neighboring properties, not cause erosion, or not  cause any structure to be flooded or damaged by  the discharge.  Ideally, wastewater should be evenly dispersed  across a large area if one is available. This is easily  done on large lots but more difficult on small lots.  You should consider a combination of slow and  even dispersal of the wastewater across an area of  your property that is away from a septic system  drain field. If this is not practical for your property,  you should consider collection of the wastewater  by a pumper truck for discharge at a wastewater  treatment facility or other suitable location depend- ing on the quality of the wastewater. Heavily chlo- rinated wastewater may cause permanent damage  to native and non-native landscaping and it is best  that this type of wastewater be transported to a  wastewater treatment facility.  9 The GRIT - June 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 6 10 The GRIT - June 2018 - Volume 34 - No. 6 11   The GRIT – June 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 6                                                                                                     Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
