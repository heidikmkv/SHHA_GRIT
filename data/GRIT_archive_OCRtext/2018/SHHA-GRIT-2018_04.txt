You Can Increase Security in Your Neighborhood by  Forming a Neighborhood Watch Neighborhood Watch programs are generally formed on a block-by-block  basis; however, they can be made to work in any kind of geographically  structured neighborhood, for example, a single Unit within Sandia Heights.  In association with Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office, this program will help  you and your neighbors organize to reduce and hopefully eradicate crime.  So how does a neighborhood watch organization form? The following  information is from BernCo Neighborhood Coordination Specialist, Darrell  Dady.   You, or a neighbor, decide to host an initial Neighborhood Watch meeting. The meeting’s host calls the Neighborhood Coordination Specialist at 468-7364 to provide his or her name, address and phone number to receive a “starter packet” that will include, among other items, a form to collect demographic information from your neighbors. Collect names, addresses and phone numbers on the form. The host then sends the completed list back to the Neighborhood Coordination Specialist. The Neighborhood Coordination Specialist will contact the host to set up a date and time for the meeting and then mail out invitations to each name on the list. The Sheriff’s Department deputy will assist with conducting the meeting and provide community resource information for all attendees. To qualify for sign placement, 50% of the homes on the block must be represented at the Neighborhood Watch meeting. The block is now organized and may collectively purchase Neighborhoods Organized Against Crime (NOAC) street signs. The first sign is free, but subsequent signage will be payed for by your neighborhood watch group. If you or your neighbors witness a crime in  progress or suspicious activity, call 911  (emergency) or 798-7000 (BernCo Sherriff non-emergency). Darrell Dady  can be reached at 468-7364 or at ddady@bernco.gov.

Commercially, this new technology offers the  potential for improvements in safety and security for  all of us as well as many other applications including  agricultural production, wildlife management, and  package delivery to your doorstep. It’s also a great  recreational tool to get that aerial photo you only saw  before in National Geographic or Google Maps. But, as  with any new technology, along with the beneficial  uses, there are always those who bend or break the  rules for personal gain or for criminal activity.    It needs to be noted that there are no current Sandia  Heights covenants concerning the use of drones.  What follows is some information on practices and  potential future actions regarding the use of drones  at the federal, state, and local levels which can impact  their usage in Sandia Heights.    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has set the  federal rules for drones. The FAA clearly distinguishes  between drones for commercial purposes and those  for the hobbyist. Commercial drones must be  registered, an FAA Remote Pilot’s Certificate is  required for the drone operator, and if the drone will  be flying in controlled airspace, prior approval from  FAA’s air traffic control system is required.  Recreational drones are covered under the Small UAS  (Unmanned Aircraft System) Rule, effective Aug 29,  2016, which places drones under the same rules and  guidelines as those for model aircraft. Specifically,  operators must (taken from the Special Rule for  Model Aircraft, Public Law 112-95 Section 336):  a. Register the UAS with the FAA.  b. Fly for hobby or recreational purposes only.  c. Follow a community-based set of safety  guidelines.  d. Fly the UAS within visual line-of-sight.  e. Give way to manned aircraft.  f. Provide prior notification to nearby airport and  air traffic control tower, if one is present, when  flying within 5 miles of an airport.  g. Fly UAS that weigh no more than 55 lbs. unless  certified by a community-based organization.  Neither the State of New Mexico nor Bernalillo  County has rules in place for drones. A bill was  introduced last year at the NM legislative session  (Senate Bill 556) to prohibit lawful surveillance  without a warrant, but it did not make it to the floor  for a vote. Some states have adopted such a law. An  aide to Lonnie Talbert, our District 4 County  Commissioner, said that the County has plans to take  up the issue of drones sometime in the future.   It’s interesting to see how our Sandia Heights  neighbors are approaching the subject of drones.  There is a sign at the entrance to the Elena Gallegos  Open Space that drones are not permitted in the area.  Although the city has no ordinance restricting the use  of drones in public places, the rangers at Elena  Gallegos cited proximity to a National Wilderness  Area, and public safety. Also, there are similar “No  Drones Allowed” signs at both the bottom and top of  the Sandia Peak Tram. The top is clearly encircled by  the Sandia Mountain Wilderness Area. At the bottom  Tram terminal, although it is private property, the  guards cite public safety concerns and will/have  kicked out violators. The High Desert Community to  our south has no rules or regulations for drones.   Rules and guidelines for outdoor hobbyists who want  to employ drones for that big photo shot can be  found at www.jmpeltier.com/2017/05/14/rules-flying- drone-backpacking-hiking/.  Specifically, the article  says drones are prohibited:  a. Within all national parks.  b. Within all federally-designated wilderness areas.  Continued from page 2    3   The GRIT – April 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 4                                                                                                  c. In general, not prohibited in state parks, but  rules vary from state-to-state and park-to-park.  Drones may be prohibited, so look for signs.  d. From flying within five miles of an airport,  hospital or heliport.  e. Within Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR),  such as over a fire or a crime scene.   f. From operating less than 100 meters from  wildlife.  The Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) is  providing some guidance for homeowners with  drone problems. Although there are currently no  county or state laws concerning drones, the  operation of a drone for recreational purposes in a  manner which constitutes an unlawful action, a  law already on the books, will elicit an officer’s  response and could result in criminal charges. For  example, flying a drone in a manner to look over a  neighbor’s fence will be addressed under peeping- tom laws. Continual photographing of children  getting on/off a school bus or walking down the  street can be treated under child pornography  laws. But please, do not grab the 12-gauge and  shoot down the drone. That is also a criminal  offense.  Sandia Heights Security has a similar approach  when receiving drone complaints. They will first  attempt to seek out the pilot in order to resolve  the problem amiably. However, should evidence  of criminal activity be identified, Sandia Heights  Security will contact BCSO.  There are assertions from some Bernalillo County  officials that Kirtland Air Force Base is looking into  creating a drone-free corridor along the entire  west side of the Sandia Mountains. Although the  north-south runway at the Sunport has been  closed for some time now, the Air Force does  regularly fly helicopter missions in a north-south  direction, seemingly along Tramway Blvd.   In conclusion, it needs to be noted that there has  not been an avalanche of drone complaints to  date. SHHA has received two calls in the past year  but, as noted above, the covenants do not cover  drones. Both an assistant to Lonnie Talbert and a  lieutenant at BCSO report that they have received  just a few calls in the last year. Sandia Heights  Security reports four drone complaints in the  same period. Taking an optimistic view, it appears  so far that recreational drone pilots in our  community are operating in a responsible manner  and we should feel good about that. For now.

There were presentations from the  National Weather Service (NWS), US Forest Service  (USFS), Albuquerque and Bernalillo County Fire  Departments (AFD & BCFD) and several others.   Although the briefings were geared towards  residents living in rural environments with their  associated forests and  grasslands, some of the  information is useful for  protecting our residential  properties here in Sandia  Heights in the event of a  wildfire in or near our  community.    The NWS briefer stated  that last November through  January saw record low moisture levels with warm  and dry conditions state wide. This situation has  created a significant amount of fine ground fuels  that can carry fire due to poor snow pack levels. As  such, this year’s fire season may be a very active  one. The USFS, AFD, and BCFD briefers presented  information on how best to protect yourself, your  properties, and your pets and livestock. They  stressed the concept of creating defensible spaces  (or “zones”) around your properties. These zones  are defined by distances outwards from your  property. Descriptions of these zones and how to  create them are included in an AFD brochure which  is posted on our website  (www.sandiahomeowners.org).    While the zone concept in the AFD brochure  makes sense in areas that are heavily wooded and  subject to constant threat of devastating wild-fires,  “defensible space” should not be interpreted to  mean removing trees or completely clearing all  vegetation in a 30-foot radius around your home.  Sandia Heights has not experienced a wildfire (other  than occasional small brush fires) for many years, if  ever. Coupled with the fact that the vegetation in  Sandia Heights is less dense than, for example, the  East Mountains, this means that the threat of  property damage or loss is considerably less in  Sandia Heights.    As I have indicated in articles published during  the last several years on this subject, most of our  covenants state that “natural vegetation is to be left  undisturbed where practical on all lots except for  access to the property, clearing of building sites,  and establishment of lawns and flower beds  adjacent to buildings”. The  ACC has published a Design  Guideline for Landscaping,  which makes the following  points:  1.  Sandia Heights is  based on an open space  concept where natural  vegetation is of great  importance. Deed  restrictions require that  natural vegetation be left undisturbed where  possible and replenished after construction is  finished.  2.  Residents are asked to keep their  properties clear of dead trees and other vegetation  since this material is easily combustible.    The use of the terms “where practical” and  “where possible” gives you the ability to make wise  decisions based on your perception of the damage  to your property that could occur as a result of a  local wildfire. Although SHHA discourages a “bare  earth” policy as it pertains to vegetation on your  property, reducing the amount of combustible  materials and clearing dead vegetation make good  sense.            8   The GRIT – April 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 4                                                                                                 ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  159 Whitetail Drive – Garage Addition  215 Spring Creek Place – Re-gravel Driveway  421 Live Oak Court – Reroof  540 Black Bear Loop – New Construction, Single Story  Residence  542 Black Bear Loop – Reroof  680 Blackhawk Drive – Deck Replacement  727-8 Cedar Hill Lane – Reroof  991 Lynx Loop – Shade Structure  1056 Red Oaks Loop – Re-stucco and Paint Trim  1121 Marigold Drive – Install Wooden Fence and Install  New Door  1121 Marigold Drive – Change Trim, Garage Door,  Stucco, and Door Colors  1143 Marigold Drive – Landscaping and Fence  Installation  1144 Marigold Drive – Retaining Wall  1181 Laurel Loop – Re-stucco Patio, Fence, and Mailbox  1532 Eagle Ridge Drive – In Ground Swimming Pool  Installation  1560 Eagle Ridge Road – Landscaping and Replace  Entry Gate  1802 Tramway Terrace Loop – Re-gravel Yard and Patio  1872 San Bernardino Avenue - Reroof  1929 Quail Run Drive – Evaporative Cooler  Replacement  2315 Calle de Rafael – Replace All Existing Windows  and Doors  2416 Tramway Terrace Ct. – Re-stucco South Wall  2735 Tramway Circle – Reroof  2805 Tramway Circle – Re-stucco  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.
