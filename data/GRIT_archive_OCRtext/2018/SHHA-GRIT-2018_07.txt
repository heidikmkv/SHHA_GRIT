Desiccated vegetation. An extreme wildfire  season is here. On May 15 we came close to having a dam- aging wildfire. It burned a few hundred yards from Sandia  Heights in Desert Highlands subdivision of High Desert. It  burned 7 acres of open space and caused damage to 3  homes, but no injuries or loss of structures.   When the fire started, winds were 15–20 mph from the  west, up a dry, sparsely vegetated drainage with grass, low  shrubs, cactus, desert willow, and juniper trees. Within 5  minutes the fire spread hundreds of yards toward many  single-family homes in northeast High Desert—and close  to Simms Open Space, Elena Gallegos Picnic Area, and San- dia Wilderness.  The High Desert fire was a wake-up call—wildfire can  strike any time, anywhere. It also provided valuable les- sons for Sandia Heights. Among those lessons are:  • Be Aware of Weather Conditions. Mid-day weather on  May 15 was warm, dry, and windy—normal for this time  of year and ideal for rapid wildfire growth. Under windy  conditions, the fire can move faster than you, with “em- ber skip” carrying blazing brands up to half a mile in less  than a minute.  • Look for Smoke and Flames. High Desert residents had  only minutes of warning. The first wildfire signs you  might notice are an acrid smell and thick smoke: whitish  for burning grass, gray-brown for brush or trees, black- brown for structures. Use your senses to warn you of  danger. Immediately find where smoke is coming from.  If the fire is nearby or upwind—and especially if you  sense heat or flames—make a snap decision: fight or  flee. Evacuate now with family and pets. Alert neigh- bors to the danger. If the fire is more distant, down- wind, or crosswind, notify 911, make a quick evacuation  plan, and await instructions from first responders or, if  you’ve signed up for it, Bernalillo County’s “reverse 911  system.”   • Impact of Residential Construction and Landscaping.  Flames in the High Desert wildfire shot up 15–20 feet.  Most homes’ exposure was along the back with 4- to 8- foot walls offering protection. Homes had stucco or  brick siding, fire-resistant roofing, and minimal exterior  woodwork. Non-flammable and xeric landscaping  helped. Of the 30–40 homes exposed to flames, only 3  suffered substantive fire damage and none was de- stroyed. Smoke damage affected over a dozen homes.  • Don’t Count on Communications or Utilities. In High De- sert, like Sandia Heights, utility lines are underground.  But they emerge near meters or house access points. In  the High Desert fire, most cable, phone, and electric  boxes were melted and inoperative within minutes of  exposure to flames—meaning residents had no electric- ity or landline communication. Cell service was initially  available but was soon overwhelmed by the volume of  calls—and especially from residents sending photos  and videos of the fire. Major lesson here: you may have  no communication or power if wildfire sweeps through  your neighborhood, whether your home is threatened  or not. Have a contingency plan for contacting family  and friends if normal means of communication fail and  you must evacuate.  • Notification. The High Desert wildfire spread rapidly,  burning several hundred yards in less than 15 minutes.  Most residents became aware of the fire when they  smelled smoke or were notified by neighbors. It took  nearly 20 minutes for fire fighters and first responders  to arrive from the nearest Albuquerque FD station more  than five miles away. No notification or evacuation or- der came from ABQ Police or Fire Departments. Resi- dents had to decide to stay or leave. (Note: evacuation  notices in Sandia Heights would come from the Bernco  Sheriff’s Office or Fire/Rescue Department.)   • Plan for Evacuating and Reuniting. The burned area of  High Desert, like Sandia Heights, has winding roads with  many cul-de-sacs and few egress points, making evacu- ation difficult and entry by first responders compli- cated, especially with flames and smoke sweeping over  roadways. Major lessons learned are:   o Sign up now for emergency notifications   o Neighbors are a valuable source of help  o Make evacuation and communication plans for all  household members, including pets  o Assemble a “go-bag” with irreplaceable documents  and photos, medications, changes of clothing, valua- bles, portable computers, and cell-phones with  chargers to be available at a moment’s notice  o Pre-plan two or more routes to safety out of your  home and neighborhood regardless of where the fire  is  o Make a contingency plan to reunite elsewhere with  family and friends should you not be able to return  home for hours or days  But perhaps the most important lesson from the High De- sert fire is that wildfires can, do, and will endanger our  community. Fire prevention is important. But when wild- fires occur, advanced planning and preparedness will save  us—our homes, families, pets, and valuables.    3   The GRIT – July 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 7     BERNALILLO COUNTY COMMISSION  FURTHER RESTRICTS FIREWORKS    On June 12, the Bernalillo County Board of Commis- sioners approved a ban, effectively immediately, on  fireworks in the unincorporated areas of the county,  which includes Sandia Heights.    “Bernalillo County is experiencing extreme  drought conditions and the potential risk to life,  property and the environment prompted the ban,”  said Bernalillo County Fire Chief Greg Perez.    Bernalillo County has banned the sale and use of  aerial devices to include aerial shell kit reloadable  tubes, aerial missile-type rockets, helicopters, aerial  spinners, stick-type rockets, and Roman candles.  Also banned are ground  audible devices that in- clude  firecrackers  and  chasers.     If  an  individual  is  caught with prohibited  fireworks, a citation could be issued and the individ- ual may have to appear in court. Violators could be  fined up to $1000 and sentenced to up to one year  in jail. If the use of fireworks caused a fire that dam- aged property, the responsible individual may be  held liable for those damages.    To report someone using illegal fireworks, call the  Bernco Sheriff at (505) 798-7000. To report a fire  call 9-1-1.

Actually, a  wildfire could happen in Sandia Heights, as we were rudely  reminded with the recent High Desert fire.  The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association has estab- lished a Wildfire Preparedness Committee charged with  providing information to residents on what to do before,  during, and after a wildfire. This new column will appear in  the next 4 GRITs to discuss important information regard- ing wildfire preparedness. More specific information can  be found on the SHHA webpage, under the tab “Wildfire  Preparedness.”    This first installment is an overview of important topics  each Sandia Heights resident should consider: how to pre- pare your house and property, how to prepare your family,  the contents of an emergency "go bag" and, lastly, what  to do during an evacuation.  To prepare your house and property, create a defensive  space around your house by removing flammable materi- als—including dead vegetation, firewood, trash—and  move any propane tanks or other explosive materials far  from your house. A complete description of what is meant  by a “defensive space” is in the article “Ready, Set, Go” un- der the Wildfire Preparedness tab on the SHHA website.  Interestingly, the adobe walls in High Desert prevented or  slowed the fire’s advance.  Preparing your family for an emergency includes having  a family evacuation plan and a designated meeting place if  separated; having all family members know how to turn off  the water, gas, and electricity to your house; having cages  needed to remove pets; and preparing a “go bag” with the  important stuff you can grab with only 5 minutes’ warning.  It is a good idea to have a “weather radio.” In the recent  Ute Park Fire, there was a total loss of telephone and inter- net communication in the village of Angel Fire.  You cannot  count on any of the normal means of getting or sending  information during a disaster.  Having a “go bag” and a list of items to take during an  evacuation could prevent later confusion. A description of  what should be included can be found in the article entitled  "How to Create a Go-Bag" on the Wildfire Preparedness  web page.  The last topic is what to do when it is necessary to evac- uate. The Wildfire Preparedness tab lists several emer- gency sign-up sites that can try to contact you (if commu- nication is possible) in an emergency and to advise where  you should go. You must make the decision of when to  evacuate, and you may decide to leave before an emer- gency is declared. Once an emergency is declared and you  leave, you will not be allowed to return until the "all clear"  is issued.    STORM DRAINS ON COUNTY   EASEMENTS AND STREETS  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    Most residences here in Sandia Heights have a utility ease- ment running along the edges of the property that borders  County streets. Known as public utility easements (or  PUEs), they are about 7 feet wide and are inside the prop- erty boundaries. As a property owner, you own the land  within the PUE, but the County has the right to allow utility  companies to install various underground utilities such as  water, gas, cable, and electrical lines within the PUE. For  most properties, these easements are plainly noted on  property surveys. To handle runoff water from neighbor- ing properties that have irrigation systems or from rainfall  during our rainy season [ed., may it be abundant this year!],  many residences have storm drains that were installed ei- ther by the County or by the property owner with County  approval, located within the PUEs or, in some cases, within  the street right-of-way (ROW) areas. The ROW areas in- clude the paved portion of the streets and, in many cases,  the unpaved area between residential property bounda- ries and the edge of  the existing street as- phalt paving.  These  drains are normally  small-diameter  con- crete or corrugated  metal culverts that go  under driveways or  walkways that cross  the street ROW and/or the PUEs. In some cases, these cul- verts continue under the street to allow the runoff water  to empty into an arroyo or into another drainage system to  prevent flooding of our residential properties. The County  is responsible for inspecting, maintaining, and cleaning  these culverts. As a property owner, if you observe that  any of these drains located in or under the ROWs or PUEs,  or under the paved portions of streets near your property,  are clogged or damaged, call the County Road Department  at 848-1500 and they will inspect, repair, and clean out  these drains. Please keep in mind that the County is not re- sponsible for any drains that lie outside the PUEs or street  ROWs.  8   The GRIT – July 2018 – Volume 34 – No. 7    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  2 Juniper Hill Loop – Reroof  11 Juniper Hill Loop – Repair/Reinforce Deck  13 Eagle Nest Drive – Reroof  43 Rock Ridge Drive – HVAC Replacement  201 Juniper Hill Road – Plant Two Trees  432 Live Oak Lane – Restucco  443 Live Oak Loop – Door and Window Installation  451 Live Oak Lane – Reroof  455 Live Oak Road – Restucco   541 Black Bear Loop – Landscaping  548 Black Bear Road – Remodel and Second Story Ad- dition  558 Black Bear Place – Replace Mailbox  733 Tramway Lane – Sunroom Remodel  750 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  755 Tramway Lane – Stucco Repair  760-1 Tramway Lane – Shade Structures  793-P Tramway Lane – Lattice Replacement  803 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   985 Lynx Loop – Reroof  1028 Tramway Lane – Reroof   1052 Red Oaks Loop – Restucco   1156 Laurel Loop – Restucco  1241 Rockrose Road – Install Security Doors  1452 Honeysuckle Drive – Replace Swamp Cooler   1478 Morning Glory Road – Replace Window Panes   1708 Quail Run Court – Replace Retaining Wall  1805 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence Installation  1825 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence Installation  1929 Quail Run Drive – Reroof  1939 Quail Run Loop – Reroof   2026 Quail Run Drive – Reroof  2175 Black Willow Drive – Restucco and Window Re- placement  2301 Calle de Rafael – Repair Block Walls  2321 Calle de Gabriel – Reroof  2732 Tramway Circle – Reroof   2736 Tramway Circle – Stucco Repair  2803 Tramway Circle – Repair/Replace Fence and  Restucco   8240 Raintree Drive – Repaint Stucco  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.    NOTES FROM THE SANDIA HEIGHTS  VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT  Historical item from May 4, 1983, SHHA Newsletter  Now that the wood-heating season is over, the Fire De- partment urges all residents to have their chimneys and  stove pipes cleaned. The accumulation of soot and pitch  not only restricts a proper draft but also presents a seri- ous fire hazard. There have been a number of flue fire  explosions in Sandia Heights this winter during which,  due to the quick response by the Fire Department, very  little damage was sustained. There are a number of  chimney sweep companies listed in the Albuquerque  Yellow Pages.   Another fire hazard which will be present in the sum- mer months will be the improper disposal of barbeque  coals. It is recommended the coals be dumped on the  bare ground and doused with water. Do not put either  stove ashes or barbeque coals into a plastic garbage can.  An incident of this nature last year nearly caused a seri- ous residential fire.  The Sandia Heights Volunteer Fire Department was or- ganized some fifteen years ago by members of the com- munity who were willing to give of their time to attend  training drills and respond to emergency situations. In  the last two years, due to Volunteers being transferred  by their companies, the force has been reduced to one  County paid fireman and nine trained Volunteers. During  the day not all of the trained Volunteers are available,  due to their employment or school hours. The paid Fire- man is only on duty from 7AM to 5PM during the week.  The officers of the Fire Department are making an ur- gent request to the men and women of Sandia Heights  to seriously consider giving of their time to this commu- nity function. All protective clothing, boots, helmet and  other needed items are furnished by the Fire Depart- ment. Training drills are currently held every other Satur- day from 9AM to 12PM. For more information, please call  the Training Officer at 292-3335.  In the event of a fire or medical emergency please do  not delay or hesitate to call 294-4011 for assistance. We  would rather respond to many small situations instead of  one large involvement resulting from a delayed call.   [Ed. Note: So glad we now have professional, 24/7 fire- men just down Paseo.
