Come visit with your neighbors, support the Fire District  and find gifts and ideas for the Holiday Season.  from the HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION  A Board of Directors meeting was held in October.  Among items  discussed were covenant violations.  There are persistent offenders!  It was decided to pursue the violators with one wor~ letter  then turn the violation over to the Association Attorney to bring  suit.  An amount of Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association money  has been allocated for legal fees.  Under discussion also was  the continuation of the GRIT.  The GRIT is the primary source of  communication for the neighborhood but does need to be more than  classified advertisements.  Beginning with the next issue  (deadline February 15th, 1982) there will be included summaries  of covenants for the different units as well as reports of  Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association, Four Seasons and whatever  articles can be obtained.  There has been consideration by the county for additional C-1 zoning  along Tramway Boulevard.  Among other things, there have been two  shopping centers proposed at Tramway and San Antonio, both have been  rejected at least for the present time.  It would behoove residents to  become informed and involved when these issues come up again.  GRIT EDITORIAL  GRIT EDITORIAL  GRIT EDITORIAL  The Homeowners' Association is receiving unwarranted abuse  regarding the water rate increase.  Some homeowners are not  paying dues because "The Homeowners' Association didn't do  anything about the water rates".· 'l'he Tram Company rented a large  room at the Hilton; very few residents appeared.  A member of  the Homeowners Board was to gather information to present to the  Board; he did not but became one of the intervenors.  A presentation  was made to the Board by another intervenor within a week of the  final hearing in Santa Fe; a lengthy and worthwhile discussion  ensued.  One of the board members, who is a president of a  different Utility Company and has had many dealings with the State  Corporation Connnission and direct involvement with the Public  Service"'Commission and rate-making procedures.  After listening to  .,,.,,  both sides of the issue and the expertise of the experienced board  member, it was decided not to challenge the increase.  Pressure  from the Board and the intervenors did bring a three year  moratorium on the next increase; there will not be another  increase before 1984, at which time the Sandia Heights Homeowners'  Association will become involved.  The opinion of the Board was  supportive of the presentation of the Utility Company.  The Company  had said 85% increase was sufficient after having been granted  an even greater percentage but felt the greater increase was  unnecessary; more hearings-would most likely have resulted·  in the greater increase.  In fact the actual average percentage  of increase has been approximately 73%.  The Homeowners' Association  "did nothing about the watelT rate increase" because the Association  Board after becoming educated to the facts involved felt an increase  was both necessary and inevitable.  The neighborhood association needs your support as they continue  to represent you concerning the following:  Cost of snow plowing the roads in the winter  Covenant violations  Involvement in area zoning changes  Last but not least, expansion and maintenance of the  park where five soccer teams, two softball teams and dozens  of neighborhood children play  Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association continues to be active  on your behalf; your continued support is necessary and  appreciated.

This redirection should benefit our efforts by not flooding the grass  and sprinklers!  REMINDERS:  Summer·and recreational vehicle season is coming to an  end.  As a courtesy to your neighbors please store the recreational  vehicles in a storage area rather than the side yard.  Visible  outdoor clotheslines (solar dryers!) are in violation of the  covenants.  The county has received a complaint about dirt bikes.  There is  an ordinance (137) about "operating any motor driven vehicle ...  in such a manner that a person residing in the area is caused  discomfort or annoyance".  A violator found guilty is subject  to a .fine and/or imprisonment (up to 90 days). It is recommended  that bikers use the area known as North Albuquerque Acres west of  Tramway Blvd. and west of houses in that area to within 300  feet of houses or populated area.  A note from the treasurer sends apologies to those who got a  reminder to pay their dues after they had done so.
