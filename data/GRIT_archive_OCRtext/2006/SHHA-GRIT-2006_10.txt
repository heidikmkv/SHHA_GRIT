  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association          October 2006    Unified Covenants  After having held several informational meetings we’ve come to realize that we need to have  more opportunities to present and gather homeowner input. We are re-evaluating the program  schedule. Therefore, there will be no voting in October but will be rescheduled for a future date.    Cell Phone Tower Update  T-Mobile is inviting all interested Sandia Heights Residents to a meeting at the William Sibrava  Sheriff Substation, on Holly Street one block north of Eubank and Paseo on Tuesday, October 17  at 7pm.     Photo Contest   It’s that time of year, again, folks. We’re accepting entries for our annual cover  photo contest for the 2007 Sandia Heights Resident Directory. Submissions are  due to the SHHA office by November 15. It would be wonderful to get a greater  variety of photos to choose from instead of the usual winter season photos that are  submitted in November. If you have some Spring or Fall shots, send them in. If you are the lucky  winner, your photo will be featured on the cover of the 2007   Directory, and you will be acknowledged as the photographer. Submission criteria:  o You must be a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association.  o You must be an amateur photographer.  o Photos must be related to the Sandia Heights area (see the cover on the 2006 Directory).  o Photos must be able to fit reasonably on the cover of the directory without loss of the  composition.  o Photos must be in color, and may be submitted digitally or as a hard copy.  o The resident must submit a statement that the photograph is an original taken by the  homeowner, that he/she is not a professional photographer (in business as a photographer)   and that you grant permission to SHHA to use the photo.      All entries may be picked up at the office once the Directory is published. Be creative and good  luck!    Security Alert!  In September’s Little GRIT we told you about several burglaries in the Sandia  Heights area. The burglar has entered through unlocked doors (sliding glass and garage  side doors) while occupants were sleeping. The burglar is interested in ladies' purses  and men's wallets and personal computers. The Bernalillo County Sheriff informed  us that this burglar is very brazen about entering, seems to be only interested in  cash, leaves your doors propped open so he can easily exit, and seems to only enter  through unlocked doors (not breaking windows or doors down). We are urging  you to lock your doors/windows, even when you are home.

Many nights driving home, I can barely see the people walking  with or without their dogs. And many times their dogs are  unleashed. My concern is that someone or someone’s dog may  be struck inadvertently. I am 25 years old with fairly decent  eyesight. However, I can barely see people walking on our dark  streets. Like most residents, I would like to keep the natural  beauty without street lights. So I am urging those who choose to  walk on our streets past sunset to wear reflective clothing to be  seen. This is very important on streets where the vegetation is  thick and around corners. And, stay to the left side of the roads  facing traffic. Often I am driving down my street and people  can be found in the middle of the road, creating a very  dangerous situation. Please urge your family and neighbors to  wear something reflective, or something that emits light, so that  they can more easily be seen. This is for everyone’s safety.

Siberian Elm – Not  Welcome in Sandia  Heights by Kathy  Granillo, Resident    Hasn’t the rain been  great? We are still in a  long-term drought, but  all of this rain will help  replenish the aquifer and  green up our gardens and open spaces. It  also promotes growth of pesky weeds,  including large numbers of seedlings and  saplings of the invasive Siberian Elm.    Siberian Elm is an exotic tree that was  planted as an ornamental in Albuquerque in  the first half of the 1900s. It is not allowed  by our covenants in Sandia Heights. This  tree is an invasive species, poised to do great  harm to our natural community.    An invasive species is one that displays  rapid growth and spread, establishes over  large areas, and persists. Invasiveness is  characterized by robust vegetative growth,  high reproductive rate, abundant seed  production, high seed germination rate, and  longevity. This definition fits Siberian Elm  perfectly.    Many people fail to realize that this tree will  continue to spread and increase in numbers  and density so long as even one seeding tree  is present.  If nothing is done, large trees  along roads become traffic hazards, roots of  trees near homes can clog septic systems  and damage sewer and water pipes, many  wildlife species will be harmed by intrusion  and takeover from elms, and accompanying  water and native seed sources will be lost.     What can you do? Pull sprouts as soon as  they come up – this tree puts down roots  faster than you will believe possible. The  sooner you pull them up, the easier it will  be.    Removal of Siberian elms larger than  seedlings presents a major challenge, since  incomplete removal will result in sprouting  from the cut stump or root fragments.   Stumps will sprout many stems that can  grow several feet the first year.    The only permanent method of removal, and  the only way to avoid root sprouting, is to  use low-impact herbicide applications in the  right concentrations, timed for particular  seasons when they will be most effective.  Mid to late-summer applications of Garlon  3A® to stumps immediately after cutting  will usually provide good control, as will  late-summer-to-late-fall applications of  Roundup Pro®.  Either of these herbicides  can be used in riparian areas, but care must  be taken not to get any in water.
