          WAITING TOO LONG AT INTERSECTIONS?   by Marsha Thole     After waiting up to 7 or more minutes (my patience goes only so far) on the side street at  some intersections (Eubank & Paseo, Tramway & San Bernardino), I decided to find out  what was happening, and contacted Bobby Baker, Bernalillo County Traffic Engineer.  This is what I learned. One of the reasons may be that the intersection does not have  detection cameras. Also, the sun can affect the detection as well when there are cameras.     When there are no cameras, during the peak times (6-8 am; 11:30-1:30; and 3-8 pm), the  lights run on a 90-second cycle length. It takes 90 seconds to completely cycle around the  entire intersection. If you arrive at the signal right when it turns red, the longest you  should have to wait is 68 seconds during those hours. However, any additional green time  not used on the side streets goes to the main line, which is added to the 68 seconds. So  technically, the absolute longest you could wait would be approximately 78 seconds  during the peak times. If you are waiting any longer than 90 seconds, then you're  probably not getting detected. Do not stop beyond the first white line--that can cause a  longer wait until someone on the opposite side of the street triggers the signal. If you are  experiencing problems, then please contact Bobby Baker at:  rbaker@bernco.gov. He is  very responsive and will go out to check the location where someone is experiencing  problems.

Sandia Heights Homeowners Association              February 2006 The GRIT    Page 2  PRESIDENTS MESSAGE  By Ed Whitten    SHHA needs you.  We are always in need of volunteer help for our  community and the SHHA administrative  activities.  Office Help;  The SHHA office assistants (Lena Martinez and  Sheraz Saint-Lot) could use some help with  WEB site management. We currently pay for  WEB site support and we are satisfied with that  work; however, there are many tasks that the  assistants could handle with a minimal amount  of training or volunteer support. If you or  someone you know could volunteer some help in  this area, please contact the SHHA office.  Legal Help:  The association could use a board member with  legal expertise. We have excellent legal  representation for major efforts, but there are  many issues that require legal advice or  recommendations. It becomes expensive when  we use our attorney for various simple  questions. If you or someone you know can help  our community by providing legal advice, please  contact us.  Committee Help;  We are always in need of more help on our  various committees. So far this SHHA year  (since June of 2005) we have lost four valuable  members of the Board Of Directors (BOD) due  to attrition for personal reasons. This attrition  rate is not unusual, but it always puts a strain on  other directors. The Architectural Control  Committee has been particularly affected. If you  can help and want to serve your community,  please step forward. New director candidates  and committee volunteers are needed. In June  we will have several members ending their 3  year commitment. A nominating committee to  recruit new candidates will be identified and put  in place in a couple of months. Please consider  your availability as a new director and contact  any current BOD member. At present, there is  no representation in North Sandia Heights and  only one member of the BOD North of Live  Oak. The board could also use more female  members and parents with young children, to  help bring more diversity to the needs of our  community.  Update to the Waste Water  Ordinance  The county will have voted on the new  ordinance on January 24, 2006. It is expected to  pass by the time you receive this GRIT. It would  then become effective the end of February. The  following is a summary of the relevant questions  and answers provided by the County  Environmental Health Department:  Why is the County changing the  ordinance?  There are two reasons to change the wastewater  ordinance.  1. We need to update our ordinance to meet  the changes to the State statutes.  2. There are some conflicts in the existing  ordinance that need to be resolved.  What is this lot size requirement?  There are actually two factors that must be  considered. One factor is the total calculated  flow (number of bedrooms). With this and the  lot size, the amount of treatment required is  determined. This is based on the amount of dirt  needed to properly treat the wastewater. The less  dirt available, the more treatment required. This  is regardless of the presence or absence of on- site wells.  Is this lot size requirement part of the  new ordinance?  The lot size requirements have been in place  since December 2000. The State matched the  requirements in the September 2005 revisions.  Can I develop a lot smaller than ¾ of an  acre?  Yes. The total flow (number of bedrooms) will  determine the required amount of treatment.  What is this 2015 requirement?  All wastewater system must meet the existing  ordinance requirements by January 1, 2015.  Systems installed starting in 2001 already meet  these requirements.  Will I need to replace my system by  2015?  It depends. Any system installed under the  current regulations that is not failing already  meets the requirements. Some systems may only  require increased disposal field size and the  addition of an effluent filter. Some systems may  require more modifications.    Continued on page 3  The GRIT                                                                                                                            Page 3  Continued from page 4  Is there a way around these lot size and  upgrading requirements?  Yes. A homeowner may apply for a variance  using their water meter readings. This variance  would be valid until the house is sold, at which  time the system must be upgraded.  Do I need to upgrade my system when I  sell the house?  No. Upgrades need to be performed when there  is a flow addition, the system fails, or 2015. The  system must be inspected, however, by a NAWT  certified inspector and the new homeowner must  apply for a wastewater operator permit using the  inspection record.    PARKS & NEW DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE  - Mark Boslough, Acting Chair    Walking path along San Bernardino    Sandia Heights residents have repeatedly sent  this message to the Board over the years: "We  want walking paths!"  A 1998 survey showed  that homeowners were overwhelmingly in favor  of pathways, with 193 YES votes and 21 NO  votes.  In a 2005 poll, residents where given 10  choices on how to make San Rafael safer.  By  far, the most popular choice was a walking path,  which was preferred by 47 out of 65  respondents.  The Board is finally listening.  We  have allocated funding- a portion which will be  matched by the County—to build a walking path  from Little Cloud Park eastward.  This is  admittedly a modest project, but may be the first  step in a larger network of trails if desired by the  neighborhoods and community.    One thing else we have learned is that nearly  everyone wants trails, but not everyone wants a  trail in front of their house.  We are working on  ways to release homeowners from any  maintenance and liability burden so that  residents will be more accepting of trails in the  right-of-way in front of their own lot.    Capital Improvement Projects    Volunteers are urgently needed to help write  Capital Improvement Project proposals.  This is  your tax money and the Board wants to bring  some back into the community, but we need  your help!   Traffic and Safety projects (road  resurfacing, trails) will be handled by Bill Wiley  (nmtriman@aol.com, 797-4949).  Parks projects  (more grass, trees, playground equipment, etc.)  will be handled by Ed Tull (tulled@unm.edu,  856-1954). Little Cloud Park is in dire need of  re-sodding with more kid-friendly turf.  W.L. Jackson Park (on Cedar Hill) never got  many of the amenities and only about half the  grass area contained in the specifications  because of County budget shortfalls.  This is an  opportunity to upgrade both parks.  For this to  happen we must get community volunteers to  write proposals.  There are not enough Board  members available for this job at this time.    Free money for bus stop improvement    The Board also wants to give money back to our  residents for projects that improve our  neighborhoods.   We allocated $200 to improve  a school bus stop in Sandia Heights, so children  can have a safer and more pleasant wait every  morning.  We will award $200 toward  improving an existing bus stop.  This can be as  simple as a park bench or wildflower garden.  If  you are interested, please contact the SHHA  office.    Parks Committee needs members    The SHHA president, in his message, called for  new Board members.  I would like to make a  special plea for parents of young children to  serve on the Board, and especially on the Parks  Committee.   Sandia Heights demographics are  changing, with many young families moving in.   This demographic has been grossly under- represented on the Board.   As the only Board  member with a child in elementary school, my  primary goal has been to make Sandia Heights a  kid-friendly and kid-safe community.  I will be  stepping off the board after five years this June,  and hope someone else will join to take on that  role.

Residents  had petitioned Bernalillo County for the humps because of a chronic speeding problem on their  street.  Despite several articles in the GRIT and a number of SHHA meetings, a few residents of  other streets have again inquired about the county's process.  The Association has no role in the  process, and takes no official position on whether our streets should or should not have speed  humps.   The decision is entirely up to residents of the street on which speed humps are  proposed.  Bernallilo County has a well-defined process that neighborhoods must follow.  As a  service to our members, SHHA fosters communication and cooperation between residents and  the county, but we do not tell our residents or the county what to do regarding speed humps.  For  more details on how to get speed humps on your street, please refer to the December 2005 Grit.  First Sandia Heights Coffeehouse a Success!    The First Sandia Heights Coffeehouse took place on Saturday, January 14, at Church of the Good  Shepherd. Around 70 people enjoyed listening to music by internationally-known duo Acoustic  Eidolon and chatting with friends and neighbors over coffee/tea/desserts before the show and  between sets.

By the time you receive this, we’ll be well into the  “short” session of the legislature.  This is when we craft the state’s budget, arguably the most  important work we do. Gas and oil revenues have generated unprecedented funds for the state  coffers.  The good news is that New Mexico has critical needs that will likely be addressed the  bad news is that these revenues will not last forever.  It is crucial that we do not create expensive  programs that will face deep cuts in the future.  This will likely be the greatest challenge we face.      In addition to the budget, other issues we’ll likely debate are eminent domain, price gouging,  minimum wage, and possibly a vote on whether to change the State Treasurer’s office from an  elected to an appointed position. As a member of the committee that grappled with the  Treasurer’s possible impeachment, I can only say that I hope it’s a process we never have to  repeat.  Our good state suffered much damage, not only in the investment community, but also in  government confidence. We’ll also be considering proposals to change the way the Treasurer’s  office operates.    And of course we’ll be dealing with trains, planes, and rocket ships we clearly have a governor  who plans on going places—and fast! To say that I’ve been busy this year is an understatement. I  sat on five interim committees that met all over the state. Because urban and rural interests often  collide, balancing the needs of both is often a precarious act. I also traveled to Washington, D.C.  to testify in front of a U.S. Senate committee in support of a nationwide law to add a bittering  agent to antifreeze.  We passed this law in New Mexico, but we are only one of three states to do  so.  For anyone who has ever lost a pet to antifreeze poisoning, my motivation requires no  explanation.    Because of my interest in conservation issues, I was invited to a White House Conference aptly  named “Cooperative Conservation.”  We heard optimistic speeches from top Washington  officials who were advocating more cooperation among stakeholders and less polarization and  litigation.  Many success stories across the country were highlighted—about 20 of which were in  New Mexico.      I was also extremely fortunate to be selected to attend the Council of State Governments  Legislative Academy, which is aimed at newly elected legislators.  Although much of what we  learned was government related, the strongest message was to be honest, fair, and open minded.   These are traits we were taught in third grade and ones that need constant reinforcement— especially in politics. During this interim period, I have also had the opportunity to hear from lots  of you.  Not a day goes by that I don’t get a call for information or help, so I’ve learned much  about your concerns and needs.     Finally, I’d like to extend an invitation to come visit me in Santa Fe—there’s nothing like  firsthand experience to understand how we work in the Capitol.  It’s not always pretty, but the  knowledge you gain will be worth the effort.
