We apologize for any omissions.  The Little GRIT         Page 2  Outdoor Lighting  - Vicki Smidt     Unit covenants in Sandia Heights address the  issue of outdoor lighting, and specifically  restrict “unshaded flood lights.” A few Unit  covenants also restrict “neon arc lamps or  mercury lights.” Lighting restrictions in both  Sandia Heights and they County appear to have  the goal of minimizing light pollution and  protecting the views of the night sky. These  restrictions are enforceable by the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association.     Bernalillo County ordinances, which are not  enforceable by the SHHA, govern this issue as  well and through this code, Sandia Heights,  (together with North Albuquerque Acres) has  further restrictions (sec. 30-181 through 30- 192). Those ordinances cite the goals of  minimizing light pollution created by the  excessive use of outdoor lighting by the  residents of Sandia Heights.     Bernalillo County ordinances state that  “outdoor lighting fixtures: may be used for, but  are not limited to: outdoor lighting of buildings  and structures, including  building overheads  and coping, outdoor lighting of recreation areas  or parking lots, security lighting, on-premises  signs, street lightings, landscape lighting,  building mounted area lighting, and, building  façade lighting.” Strictly prohibited are:  searchlights, spotlights, floodlights or lighting  fixtures used to illuminate off-premises signs.  In addition, “[a]ll outdoor light fixtures…shall  be (1) designed and operated as cutoff or  shielded aimable fixtures, (2) equipped with  and controlled by light and motion sensors or  automatic timing devices, and (3) shall remain  off between 11:00 p.m. and sunrise except for  illuminating walkways or driveways.” A cutoff  lighting fixture is one that is “designed,  installed, and operated so that the light  distribution meets the following criteria: the  candlepower per 1,000 lamp lumens does not  numerically exceed 25 (2.4 percent) at an angle  of 90 degrees above nadir (horizontal) and 100  (10 percent) at an angle of 80 degrees above  nadir. This applies to any lateral angle around  the light fixture. “Shielded aimable means a  technique or method of construction which  causes all the light emitted to be directed to the  surface or to be illuminated, so that the  emanating source of light is not visible from  any angle except those angles that exist  between the fixture and the target to be  illuminated. The emanating source shall not be  visible from any adjacent properties or  roadways to minimize light pollution.” All  provisions of the ordinance are available online  through the Bernalillo County web site at  www.bernco.gov and are entitled “North  Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights Light  Pollution Ordinance, Sec. 30-171 – 30-180  Revised.     In Sandia Heights, we are fortunate to have  beautiful views of the city and the Sandia  Mountains. Keeping light pollution to a  minimal level is the responsibility of all of us.    Community Services &  Membership Committee  PLAYGROUPS: Friday, May 21 at 11 a.m.  we will have our first meeting and get together  at the park at Cedar Hill for those interested in  playgroups or co-op babysitting or just to get to  know other families in the community. If you  have any questions please call Vicki Criel at   615-3333, or email her at vcriel@comcast.net.    Capital Improvement Projects  (CIP)  - Ed Whitten     The CIP requests have been submitted to the  county. The request included: resurfacing of 38  street segments less those covered by the  $450,000 from the state (the specific list of  priorities was agreed to with county Road  Maintenance and may be reviewed in the  SHHA office), improved turf and play area in  both Little Cloud and W.L. Jackson parks,  purchase of forest access property and clean- up/landscaping of the Brushwood common  area.      These requests like the Capital Outlay  request to the state, may or may not be  fulfilled, but at least we have formally  submitted our desires to the county.  This  process is repeated every two years.  The Little GRIT     Page 4  Crime Prevention  Tips from the  Sandia Heights  Security Patrol:  Crime exists. Your  vulnerability should not be ignored. Threat  assessment is a means for you to calmly  evaluate your risks.  ¾ Many burglars will spend more than 60  seconds attempting to break into a  home. Make sure every external door  has sturdy, well-installed dead bolt  locks.  ¾ Prune shrubbery and trees so they do  not obscure windows or doors. Plant  thorny bushes under your windows.

The formal motion to be presented at the  Annual Meeting is a Motion to Amend Something  Previously Adopted (in this case, the Bylaws that  have been in effect since June 4, 2005). If you have  any questions regarding these proposed amendments,  please contact the office.  The amendments will take  effect immediately upon the required vote.      PREAMBLE  CURRENT: The purposes of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA) are to…, and to  administer and enforce covenants, relating to the  architectural appearance of the development, as well  as to perform certain maintenance and care for the  common areas of the development.    PROPOSED: The purposes of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA) are to…, and to  administer and enforce covenants, particularly those  relating to the architectural appearance of the  development, as well as to perform certain  maintenance and care for the common areas of the  development.    RATIONALE: Present wording gives the impression  that it is only those covenants related to architectural  matters that are enforced, when, architectural is just  one of several components in the covenants.  Section 2.4 Rules of Procedures:   CURRENT: The rules of procedure provided in the  latest edition of Webster’s New World Robert’s  RULES OF ORDER, Simplified and Applied, shall  govern meetings of the Association, but may be  suspended at any meeting by Board vote.  PROPOSED: The rules contained in the current  edition of Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised  (RONR) shall govern the proceedings of the  Association.  RATIONALE: The currently identified book is not  widely used at all, however it has been used to teach  high school students basic parliamentary procedure.   RONR (as the proposed edition is called) is the most  popular and most widely used rules of procedures.  Further, there is redundancy in the inclusion of two  sections on the rules of procedures. Also, RONR is  the publication that professional parliamentarians use  as well. By using the word “proceedings” in the  proposed version, it covers all meetings.   Section 3.1 Director Qualifications:  CURRENT: Election/Appointment to the Board  requires having been a home or property owner  within Sandia heights at least one year, having been a  member of the Association for at least one year, and  having paid current dues.  PROPOSED: Election/Appointment to the Board  requires being a property owner within Sandia  Heights and a member of the SHHA.  RATIONALE: The 1-year ownership and 1-year  Association membership requirements are deleted.  This is more in line with other associations, and  allows the Board flexibility to fill vacant positions  immediately with interested people.  Section 3.12 Voting:  CURRENT: Except as may be otherwise provided in  these Bylaws, all matters before the Board shall be  decided by a majority vote of a quorum of those  Directors present.   PROPOSED: Except as may be otherwise provided  in these Bylaws, a majority vote of the quorum  present, including proxies, shall be required for  motions that have been previously publicized to the  Board no later than two days before a board meeting;  otherwise a 2/3 vote shall be required, except for  motions that are simple in nature and do not violate  the 2/3 rule (example: adjournment may be decided  by a majority vote).    RATIONALE: The wording in this section that “all  matters shall be decided by a majority vote” violates  Robert’s Rules. Motions that are previously presented  before the meeting may be decided by a majority vote  at the meeting, assuming they are not motions that  absolutely require a 2/3 vote; otherwise, a 2/3 vote is  required for motions presented without notice at the  meetings. Some motions require a 2/3 vote regardless  of when they are presented. This is done so that  important issues are given due consideration by the  board members, and no one person is allowed to rush  through a motion that, had members been given  sufficient notice and allowed adequate discussion,  may not have passed.  Section 3.13 Rules of Procedure:   CURRENT: The rules of procedure provided in the  most recent edition of Webster’s New World  ROBERT’S RULES OF ORDER, Simplified and  Applied shall govern meetings of the Board.  Page BL-2  PROPOSED: DELETE  RATIONALE: This duplicates Section 2.4.  Section 3.17 Indemnification:   CURRENT: Any person made a party to any action,  suit or proceeding by reason of fact that he is or was  a Director or employee of the Association or of any  corporation for which he served as a Director or  Officer at the request of the Association, shall be  indemnified by the Association against damages and  reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,  actually and necessarily incurred by him in  connection with the defense of such action, suit or  proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein,  except in relation to matters as to which it shall be  adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such  person is liable as a Director or employee of the  Association under the Laws of New Mexico. The  foregoing right of indemnification shall be deemed  exclusive of any other rights to which any such  Director or employee may be entitled as a matter of  law.  PROPOSED: Any person made a party to any action,  suit or proceeding by reason of fact that he or she is  or was an Officer or Director, or who is or was an  SHHA member appointed as an additional non-board  member of any SHHA-appointed committee, or  employee of the Association or of any corporation  who served as an Officer or Director at the request of  the Association, shall be indemnified by the  Association against damages and reasonable  expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually and  necessarily incurred by him or her in connection with  the defense of such action, suit or proceeding, or in  connection with any appeal therein, except in relation  to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such  action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable as  a Director or employee of the Association under the  Laws of New Mexico. The foregoing right of  indemnification shall be deemed exclusive of any  other rights to which any such Director or employee  may be entitled as a matter of law.  RATIONALE: This change protects other volunteers  (members of SHHA) who are assisting the  Board/SHHA.   Section 4.7 Secretary:  CURRENT:  …The Secretary shall perform the  duties normally incident to the office of Secretary  and other duties as may be assigned by the President  or Board.   PROPOSED: …The Secretary shall perform the  duties normally incident to the office of Secretary.  RATIONALE: The change makes the job description  consistent with the other officer position descriptions.  Section 5.1 Standing Committees:   CURRENT: Standing Committees are those  established in Sections 5.3 to 5.10 of these Bylaws.  Standing Committees shall have all the  authority of  the Board within the limits of their written charters,  which must have Board approval, except that the  Board may set spending limits for each committee,  which if about to be exceeded,  require Board  preapproval.  No Director may serve on more than  two (2) Standing Committees without Board  approval. No Officer as defined in Sections 4.4 to  4.7, except for the Treasurer who automatically heads  the Finance Committee and the President who  automatically heads the Executive Committee, may  serve as a Chairman of a Standing Committee. All  other Standing Committees shall elect their own  Chairman, and may appoint additional nonvoting  non-Board members to their committees as they may  desire. Any official actions (those requiring a  Committee vote) by a Standing Committee require a  quorum of voting members of the committee.  Decisions and actions of all Standing Committees  must be reported at each Board meeting and may be  subject to Board review except those of the  Architectural Control Committee. The Chairman of  each Standing Committee shall prepare a report for  presentation at the Annual Meeting.  PROPOSED: Standing Committees are those  established in  Sections 5.3 to 5.10 of these Bylaws.  Standing Committees shall have all the  authority of  the Board within the limits of their written charters,  which must have Board approval, except that the  Board may set spending limits for each committee  which, if about to be exceeded, require Board  preapproval.  No Director may serve on more than  two (2) Standing Committees without Board  approval. No Officer as defined in Sections 4.4 to  4.7, except for the Treasurer, who automatically  heads the Finance Committee, and the President, who  automatically heads the Executive Committee, may  serve as a chairman of a Standing Committee. All  other Standing Committees shall elect their own  chairman, although the Executive Committee may  appoint an interim chairman if necessary. The  chairman of any standing committee must be a Board  member. A Standing Committee may appoint  additional non-Board members to their committees  with full voting status as they may desire, in  accordance with their charter, who are members of  the Association having paid current dues, with full  voting status as they may desire. The exception is the   Page BL-3  Architectural Control Committee, which may need to  acquire outside expertise to conduct business. Any  official actions requiring a committee vote by a  Standing Committee require a quorum of voting  members of the committee. Decisions and actions of  all Standing Committees must be reported at each  Board meeting, with a monthly written report  submitted to the Secretary for the Association files.  Committee actions (excluding those of the  Architectural Control Committee) may be subject to  Board. The Chairman of each Standing Committee  shall prepare a brief year-end summary report for  presentation at the Annual Meeting, highlighting  activities for the period since the last annual meeting.  All Committee chairs must also submit a detailed  written year-end report to be filed with the Annual  Meeting minutes.  RATIONALE: This requires that the chairman of any  standing committee be a Board member to ensure  continuity from a standing committee to the BOD.  This incorporates the “Motion still in affect” 02-09- 05-2 GEN. Also gives a voting right on the  committees to non board members (who must be  Association members). Allows the EC to appoint an  interim chairman to a committee in special cases of  small or inactive committees. Allows committees  (like the ACC) that sometimes need the addition of  voting volunteers to properly perform their duties.  The change brings the section in accordance with the  State requirements for official records for non-profit  corporations.      Section 5.4 Finance Committee:     CURRENT: ...The Finance Committee shall arrange  for an independent annual audit of the books,  financial records and accounts of the Association.  The methodology and results of the audit will be  reported to the Board and to the Members in the  Association's publication.    PROPOSED: ...The Finance Committee shall arrange  for an annual internal financial review of the  Association’s financial records and accounts,  conducted by a committee consisting of at least one  board member and two other members, appointed by  the Board. The Finance Committee shall recommend  and the Board shall approve, the type of internal  review to be conducted. The methodology and results  of the review will be reported to the Board when  completed and to the Members at the Annual  Meeting. The Finance Committee shall comply with  State Statutes regarding official audits.       RATIONALE: The Association’s basic bookkeeping  system is cash flow accounting in Quicken with  accrual accounting for prepaid advertising. Assets are  carried at cost without depreciation. Further, the term  “audit” carries a specific meaning when referring to  the operations of corporations. The present section  also charges the Finance Committee with arranging  for an annual audit, but doesn't say when that should  be. Neither does it say what sort of audit is required-- a full-blown accounting audit by a CPA, a review by  a CPA, or something else. The proposed language  calls it an internal financial review, which is the term  that is now the accepted procedure for organizations  such as ours. The Treasurer needs to research the  state statutes for non-profits vis-à-vis a formal audit  and its timeframe.    Section 5.8 Communications and Publications  Committee:   CURRENT: The Communications and Publications  Committee shall consist of a minimum of five (5)  Board members excluding ex officio members and  shall be responsible for the publication of the  newsletter, the Annual Directory of Residents, and  such other duties and functions as are set forth in its  charter.  PROPOSED: The Communications and Publications  Committee shall consist of a minimum of two (2)  Board members, excluding ex officio members, and  shall be responsible for the publication of the  newsletter, the Annual Directory of Residents, the  website, and such other duties and functions as set  forth in its charter.  RATIONALE: This change reduces the necessary  size of the communications committee since any  major decision made by this committee would  normally involve the complete BOD or the EC. It  also adds responsibility for the website.    Section 5.10 Traffic and Safety:   CURRENT: The Traffic and Safety Committee shall  consist of a minimum of three (3) Board members  excluding ex officio members and shall work with  the Association membership and Bernalillo County  on traffic, road and safety related matters such as  street maintenance, speed controls, walking paths,  cable and utility projects, proper visibility along  roadways, and such other duties and functions as are  set forth in its charter.  PROPOSED: The Traffic and Safety Committee shall  consist of a minimum of five (5) Board members,  excluding ex officio members, and shall work with  the Association membership and Bernalillo County  on traffic, road and safety related matters such as  street maintenance, speed controls, walking paths,   Page BL-4    cable and utility projects, proper visibility along  roadways, and such other duties and functions as are  set forth in its charter.  RATIONALE: With all of the activity and proposals  coming out of this committee, it is recommended that  the minimum number of Board members be raised to  reflect the amount of work and board involvement  that are required from this committee. The rationale  for this increase is to bring more participation and  diversification to the committee and thereby provide  more internal discussion and review before proposals  and plans are presented to the BOD.     Section 7.1 Amendment Procedures:    CURRENT:…Copies of the current and proposed  Bylaws shall be made available to any Association  member requesting them.    PROPOSED: Copies of the current and proposed  Bylaws are available on the website and for reading  in the Association office.     RATIONALE: If everyone wanted hardcopies, the  Association would incur a significant expense. Just  like other organizations and associations, members  need to be directed to the website. Hardcopies could  be available, if necessary, for a small copy fee to  association members (IAW state statutes).    WILDFIRES . . .

Lights & Flu  Greetings to all my neighbors in Sandia Heights.  I am writing about night light and bird flu. We live in a special area of Albuquerque and we can  make it more enjoyable if everyone turns off their outside lights after 10pm. Light pollution is  something we can control if we all turn them off it is in our covenants to turn them off.  Also, bird flu is not here yet. It can be carried by pigeons. Therefore, I am requesting that no one feed  the pigeons and they will leave. Talk to your neighbor if they live on Tramway and have pigeons  coming to their yard. If you have any other concerns please write to us at:    SHHA@sandiahomeowners.org ask the board.  - Bill Wiley           2006   WINE TASTING RESERVATION  Saturday, June 17, 4-7pm.

Stop Home Invasions  - Bob Francis     In the past several months there has been a  rash of magazine sales people ascending on  Sandia Heights. There have been at least 20  reports of thier coming onto homeowner’s  property, and at least 3 attempts of home  invasion.     We understand that the sales people were  dropped off on Tramway Road, Sandia  Heights Rd and Juniper Road. They walk into  the various neighborhoods and approach  homeowners at their front door. This practice  can be stopped. Here is what you need to  know in order to protect your property.      First of all, there is a state of New Mexico  law which allows you to post your property  with “no trespassing” or “private property”  signs or both. This law protects the  homeowner in case the trespasser hurts  themselves while on your property.     Second, there is no Bernalillo County  ordinance which stops magazine sales.  However, if you post your property, they  cannot step foot on your property.     Third, the Sandia Security Service, and the  Bernalillo Sheriff cannot stop the sales people  unless your property is posted.     Fourth, the Bernalillo County Sheriff and  the Sandia Security Service will respond to  your call if your property is posted.  Post your signs at the entrance of your  driveway in a conspicuous place where they  can be seen.    Town Hall Meeting Cancellation     As most of you know by now, the Town  Hall meeting with the county regarding Speed  Humps that was originally scheduled for 28  March was cancelled. The primary reason for  the cancellation was the lack of proper  county/SHHA/residents coordination. The  meeting can be rescheduled if residents desire  and the appropriate county coordination can  be arranged.    HELP (REALLY, REALLY)  WANTED  - Bill Johnson    In the last edition of the Grit, a request went  out asking for individuals to announce their  candidacy for service on the SHHA Board of  Directors.  Unfortunately, we did not have a  single person step forward as a candidate.   Although the board serves many purposes, its  mission can be summed up simply. The  Association and the board help to keep Sandia  Heights a great place to live. But it requires  the effort of willing residents to invest time  and energy to fulfill our goals. The board  committees offer a variety of activities to  satisfy the talent and interests of all who serve  on the board. We need more members on the  board to function successfully and effectively.  You will find it is a rewarding endeavor.  Please call Bill Johnson (821-5696) or email  (wjohnson119@comcast.net) if you wish to  be considered for the board. Thanks, and I  look forward to hearing from you.
