Cell Phone Tower Update  A year ago I was contacted by Futures for Children about a Cell Phone Tower request from T-Mobile.  After several discussions with Futures I was left with the impression that the requested tower would be  approximately slightly higher than the existing cluster of power poles at the North West corner of Futures.  The issue was discussed on several occasions at the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA)  board meetings and at the SHHA Executive Committee meetings. Based upon those discussions, I wrote a  letter to Futures stating that the SHHA board had no objections to the tower if it was appropriately  camouflaged. In hindsight, a poll of the surrounding residents should have been taken.  Now we learn that the requested tower is 65 feet high and disguised to look like a light pole. Many  residents have spoken up and find this proposed tower very objectionable. As a result of these inputs from  residents, I am rescinding my letter of support for the tower. There is a County public hearing scheduled  for September 6 at the Bernalillo County Government Center Office at 5th and Marquette and I would  encourage concerned residents to attend. Information on the specifics of the hearing will be posted on our  web site when available and/or may be obtained from the SHHA office.  Ed Whitten, Past President of SHHA                                                                                                                                                                                               The GRIT                                                                                                                                       Page 4  Comments from the Annual  Meeting:  Dick Cline, President    Community Discussions/Suggestions:   Suggested topics from Sandia Heights  Residents: mandatory membership, barking Dog  nuisance, speed bumps, speed traps on Friday  and Saturday, improve the existing wall,  emergency response, Little Cloud Park, and  covenant enforcement.  Communications & Publications:  •  Communications via e-mail and interactive  website is being working on.  Community Service and Membership:  •  Why don’t we have mandatory SHHA  membership? It was stated that individual  units could pass their own amendments for  mandatory membership; this might be a  faster way to get full membership.  •  “Why can’t we get special pick-ups in our  community, like we do for special trash  pick-ups?” A recycling group is being  formed; watch the GRIT for updates.  Covenant Support Committee:  •  There have been repeated complaints  relating to barking and howling dogs. Noise  nuisances,  particularly  animals,  are  governed by county ordinances. You are  encouraged to, first, talk to your neighbor  with the offending dog. If that doesn’t work,  then you have the right to call the County.  •  The question was raised as to why the name  of the complainant has to be put on a  covenant complaint. Covenant enforcement  is for SHHA members, that’s why a name is  required. Also, the reason for requiring the  name of the complainant is to make sure the  complaints are coming from bona fide  neighbors and not from drive-by residents,  etc.  Parks and New Development:  •  The turf grass request at Little Cloud Park is  not consistent with the original Xeriscape  plans. It was recommended to stay with a  low water usage grass and that the current  buffalo grass was acceptable.   •  Common  areas,  deteriorating  walls,  subdivision signs; The P&ND Committee is  looking into the sign issue. The association’s  attorney is currently researching the matter  of common areas and who owns what. It  was originally intended that the residents in  the various units would take care of their  own common areas.    Traffic and Safety:  •  It  was  suggested  that  surveys  be  geographically oriented. The sound wall was  an example. That is, people on the west side  of Tramway may want a sound abatement  wall, while those east of Tramway may not  want a wall because of view obstruction.   •  Caution should be used when using cell  phones to call 911. It is recommended that a  landline be used for emergencies. GPS  coordinates are provided to the 911 Center  from your cell phone, however, sometimes  the GPS feature does not work indoors.  •  Your property should have reflective house  numbers to help the responders find the  home quickly. , displayed in a prominent  place in front.   •  There is a difference of opinion regarding  speed humps. This points up why a survey  to residents will be useful to the board. The  speed hump issue is a county process and  decision. Speed humps affect response times  of emergency vehicles.  •  Safety - pedestrians are advised to be  responsible and take precautions. An article  for the GRIT was suggested.  •  Why can’t we get some speed traps on  Tramway on the weekend? Residents are  encouraged to call the Sheriff for policing.  Suggestion made for a speed trap on Friday  and Saturday--use the $50,000 (special  funding that State Representative Bill Rehm  obtained) allotted to us for a Sheriff patrol.   •  Noise abatement wall was briefly discussed  and the location issue was mentioned.    •  Front right-of-way pathways need to be  trimmed. Sandia Heights North has boulders  in the right-of-way. The county is trimming  corners for visibility, however homeowners  are also encouraged to do so.

Letter to the Editor  The comments and opinions expressed do not  necessarily represent the views of SHHA.    Dogs Run Amok in Sandia Foothills     On an early morning walk, our stride was  abruptly interrupted a Dalmatian plunged at my  friend and took a bite of flesh out of her thigh.  Wide-eyed, I stood there in disbelief. The owner,  who had the dog on a leash, reined her in and  profusely apologized and exclaimed, “She has  never bitten anyone before…ever.”      I am quite fond of animals. Some people even  think of me as the neighborhood dog “auntie”  since I often walk my neighbors’ dogs. But after  witnessing my friend get bit, and for no apparent  reason, I am more skeptical of unknown animals.      You may think your pet will never harm anyone,  but you do not know for certain. Your “gentle”  dog may feel the need to protect you from  strangers. And the hiker may have a fear of dogs.      I ask all dog owners in the Sandia neighborhood  to be more considerate in sharing the trails. Keep  in mind that not everyone loves dogs. You cannot  know with one-hundred percent certainty that  your pet will always be on its best behavior. If  you wish to let your dog roam free, at least carry a  leash with you, call and control your dog when  you see other people on the trail. And please, pick  up your dog’s messes.     Covenant Support Committee:   - Gene Church     The SHHA office receives numerous calls  regarding barking dogs. This situation does not  constitute a covenant violation except as an  annoyance or nuisance. A much more effective  way to handle this type of complaint is to contact  the Bernalillo County Department of Animal  Control and Protection. They may be reached at  314-0280 or 873-6706. Inform them that you wish  to make a complaint under the Bernalillo code of  Ordinances; Section 6-49, Animals Disturbing the  Peace, and Section 30-120, Animals and Fowl.  My experience has been that they are very  responsive.     Those residents with dogs that bark a lot, in  consideration of your neighbors, might think  about investing in a no-bark device available at  local pet stores.
