  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                    December 2006    HAPPY HOLIDAYS!    President’s Message:       As we work on various projects and issues within Sandia Heights, we are interested in  hearing from our members. Your comments and ideas will help us improve our community.  Contact me via the office or e-mail at shha@sandiahomeowners.org.  Here are some items that the board is working on for the upcoming year. The committees are  finishing up their surveys and we will start with our first survey in the February GRIT. We are  planning on meeting with our state and district representatives to ask for future capital  improvement funds to be used for community projects.   All of our seven standing committees could use more volunteers to help with their projects.  If  you or someone you know could contribute, please contact anyone on the board. These committees  can use people who want to get involved in community activities, or who have construction,  communication, internet, and website experience.  I would encourage anyone with an interest in these  areas to volunteer.     Cell Phone Tower Update  Ed Whitten and Bill McCall  We hosted / facilitated the Town Hall Meeting on October 17, 2006 to discuss the proposed T- Mobile cell tower at Futures for Children. Approximately 25 residents attended, primarily from  the Brushwood and surrounding area. The T-Mobile representative, Rick Ramirez, did not come  prepared with a specific tower design but did show pictures of various other tower designs. He  stated that T-Mobile would provide about any design the community would accept, but he also  made it clear that T-Mobile is not willing to lower the height of any tower below 50 to 55 feet.  The county instructed T-Mobile to submit a design to the County Planning Department by  October 23, 2006 to support the December 6, County Commission Hearing. The SHHA  Executive Committee (EC) recommended, and the SHHA Board of Directors voted unanimously  at the November 8, 2006 meeting, to oppose the building of the T-Mobile cell tower. The letter  from SHHA opposing this project has been hand delivered to the county planning office. The  Executive Committee will attend the December 6, County Commission Meeting to ensure that  the residents’ position is clearly known.    PHOTO CONTEST RESULTS    We had more than 63 photographs to choose from this year! Many thanks to  all of you who participated. All your photos were beautiful. The variety was  amazing and it was difficult to select just one for the cover. Nevertheless,  we did make a selection. Look for it in early 2007.  The GRIT, Dec 2006                                                                                                               Page 2  SHHA Presents – Internationally Acclaimed Walt Michael in Concert!

Lincoln Center    About Walt Michael:  Vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Walt has appeared at the White House, the Lincoln  Center, the Kennedy Center, and toured extensively throughout the US, Canada, and Europe. His music has  been heard on ABC-TV, NBC's Tonight Show, Broadway, BBC, TNN, CBC, OLN and PBS. He has  recorded 14 albums and instructional videos, and was musical producer, composer and musician for the  Outdoor Living Network's 13-episode documentary series, Cowboy 101, which premiered in October 2004.  Considered to be a virtuoso of tremendous influence in the revival of the hammered dulcimer, Walt's  wide repertoire ranges from old-time Southern Appalachian, to Celtic, to breath-taking original  compositions.  His career spans 35 years and has taken him from the coal camps of Appalachia to the  Closing Ceremonies of the 13th Olympic Winter Games at Lake Placid, NY.  Walt is the Artist-in-Residence at McDaniel College in Westminster, Maryland, as well as the  Founder and Executive Director of Common Ground on the Hill, an international arts organization which  seeks to promote interracial and cultural harmony through traditional arts.

The GRIT, Dec 2006                                                                                                               Page 3  TREASURER’S  NOTE:   -Ed Whitten, Treasurer  Several people have asked  why we no longer include the  SHHA Financial summary (Treasurer’s  Report) in the GRIT. This practice was  deleted some time ago based on inputs from  many who felt the information was not of  value to most residents. We would be happy  to provide this report (or a brief financial  summary) if we get enough interest. In the  meantime, anyone (SHHA member) may  obtain a copy of the most recent Treasurers  Report from the SHHA office.     The Noise Level in Sandia Heights  Should Get Quieter – Tom Coyne  The noise level along Tramway Blvd.  should get quieter when the New Mexico  State Dept. of Transportation (NMDOT)  resurfaces that road using a noise reducing  asphalt material. The resurfacing is  scheduled to be complete by 30 June 2007.  The NMDOT has already filled the cracks  on Tramway Blvd. in preparation for the  resurfacing.   The resurfacing is directly the result of  several requests that SHHA made to the  NMDOT approximately two years ago. We  suggested that the District Engineer consider  using a resurfacing material such as  rubberized asphalt to reduce the tire/road  interaction noise, the primary noise source  for most vehicles. We requested that our  State Representatives obtain funds for this  project approximately one year ago and  funds have since been allocated.  Here is an example of how effective this  type of resurfacing is: The vehicle road  noise that is heard at a residence that is 100  feet from Tramway should be reduced to  that heard at a residence that is 400 feet  from that road, that is, multiply the distance  of the residence from the noise source by a  factor of 4 to determine the apparent noise  reduction when the noise source is  resurfaced with this type of material. The  cost, wear ability and drivability of the  noise-reducing surface are comparable to  that of a standard asphalt surface. This type  of noise reduction surface has been used in  Arizona and California with excellent  results. This material will not reduce the  noise of vehicles with loud exhaust systems  or that from speeding vehicles.

Nature Lovers Reminder  -Marsha Thole  Sandia Heights residents are very fortunate to be so close to national forestland. We can enjoy any  number of trails in the Sandias within minutes of our homes. While it may be tempting to take a  shortcut through private property to reach your favorite trail, we would like to remind you that doing  so is trespassing, which is illegal. Unless there is a posted sign that designates a public access  entrance to a trailhead, you may not traverse through private property to reach the forestland, whether  on foot, bicycle, motorcycle, or horseback. Please respect the privacy of neighbors whose property  backs up to forestland, and use the designated trail entrances.
