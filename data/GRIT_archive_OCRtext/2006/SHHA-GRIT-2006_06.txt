  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association               June 2006      SHHA Annual/Town Hall Meeting  Church of the Good Shepherd on Tennyson, 10 AM – 1 PM, Saturday 3 June 2006    Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and various refreshments will be available.  Come to make your input known. Business to be conducted includes:  • Introduction of new officers elected by the Board.  • Presentations by the SHHA Committee Chairpersons and Officers.  • Election of new Board members to replace outgoing Board members.  • Voting on changes to SHHA’s Bylaws. Our bylaws require a minimum of forty members  including a majority of Board Members to enact business.   • Town Hall Meeting for residents to express their concerns.    The Board of SHHA needs to know the concerns of the community. Please plan to attend  and make your input known. Democracy means involvement!      President’s Message By Ed Whitten    Re-Election Results  The regular election of officers that was conducted in April in accordance with our Bylaws was not  completed as intended and, therefore, the Board of Directors (BOD) held a re-election of officers at its May  BOD meeting. The following is the slate of officers for the 2006-2007 operational year:      Dick Cline was elected President    Ed Tull was elected Vice President    Ed Whitten was elected Treasurer  Marsha Thole will continue serving as Secretary until the end of June. (We will elect another  Secretary at our July BOD meeting.)    As your outgoing President I would like to thank both the BOD and the residents for their support this past  year. It has been a busy and fulfilling year. In my new role as Treasurer I will continue to be a part of the  Executive Committee and, thus, should be able to provide a smooth transition for Dick as your new  president. Likewise, he will make my transition to Treasurer much easier. I wish our new officers the best  of successes in the upcoming year and I am confident that they will provide excellent leadership.  I hope to see many of you at the SHHA annual meeting on 3 June 2006. The annual meeting is an  important event so I hope for a good turn out.

Art in the Heights: Meeting on June 5th at 7pm in the SHHA office.    Do the Right Thing:  Recycle!  In Sandia Heights we are blessed with many things:  beautiful views, wildlife, and tranquility.   However, one of the things that we are not blessed with is curbside recycling.  As residents of the  County, curbside recycling is a benefit that does not cross the county line.  Continued on page 3    2006   WINE TASTING RESERVATION  Saturday, 17 June, 4-7pm., Futures for Children,   9600 Tennyson (across from County Line)   $15 per SHHA member in advance, $20 per non-member   or $25 at the door    Please RSVP by Friday, June 9  WINE TASTERS:  Name____________________________________ Name_________________________________    Name____________________________________ Name_________________________________    Address________________________________________________    Phone_____________________________________    Amount enclosed___________  Mail or drop off check to:  SHHA Wine Tasting  2-B San Rafael Ave. NE  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Fine wine, delicious appetizers,  live music, silent auction,  friends – all right here in our  community! The GRIT                                                                     Page 3  Continued from page 2  Don’t think that just because we don’t have the convenience of curbside recycling you can’t recycle  on your own.  There are three very convenient City drop-off centers that are located within 5 miles of  Sandia Heights:  Smith’s at Montgomery and Tramway, Smith’s at Wyoming and Paseo del Norte  and the Eagle Rock Solid Waste Convenience Center at 6301 Eagle Rock.    At each of these locations, you can use the recycling bins to deposit glass (any color), paper,  corrugated cardboard, all plastic bottles, tin/steel, and aluminum cans.  The only item that needs to be  separated is glass – the rest of the recyclables can be combined and are placed into a single open  container.  Glass goes into a separate container.  Recyclables are then separated at the City’s  Intermediate Processing Facility. Recycling isn’t a complicated or difficult thing to do.  Make it a  part of your normal routine and you will notice a difference in the amount of trash that you haul out  each trash day!  Our landfill will notice the difference too!    In the coming months, watch for activities to support recycling and a community clean up event.  A  new committee has been formed and it will be working with the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association to support these important activities for our community.  If you are interested in getting  involved or want more information, please contact Cheryl Ferguson at 856-1403 or  Cheryl@nmpolicymatters.com.    Lisa McCormick in Concert!    Close to 100 friends and neighbors gathered for the music of  Vermont singer/songwriter Lisa McCormick at the Church of the  Good Shepherd for last month’s Sandia Heights Coffeehouse series  presentation.  Judging by the animated audience response and jovial  atmosphere, a good time was had by all. An impressive display of  art created by our own artists and an extraordinary variety of  homemade goodies by the Church of the Good Shepherd Youth  Group rounded out the evening.      This evening was once again made possible by our volunteers: Jim  Irving, Lydia Obrist, Ruth Friesen, Deb Shekter, Lori Templeton,  Nancy Terr, and Marsha Thole, Special thanks to Sue and Sy  Caudill for a very long work day.  Kerney Bolton provided sound  and lights and Linda Bolton provided booking and event management.       Thanks once again to Church of the Good Shepherd for their enthusiastic support: Pastor Dr. Sue  Gallagher, Vice Moderator Judy Gilman, and Secretary Kirk Wortman and to Michael Wilder,  Lauren Bullard, Rebecca Avery, and Cassandra Kolenc who spent most of the day baking in the  Church kitchen!        Be sure to save Saturday, Sept. 30, for the next Sandia Heights Coffeehouse. Ronstadt, Ramirez  Santa Cruz River Band from Tucson will bring us a blend of classic Mexican and contemporary  southwestern folk songs.  Band members are Michael Ronstadt (Linda Ronstadt’s brother), Ted  Ramirez and Gilbert Brown.  Check out their music at www.ronstadtramirez.com.     For more information contact Linda Bolton, 856-7100, nlightsmgt@aol.com.    The Sandia Heights Coffeehouse is an all volunteer production of your SHHA Community Service and Membership  Committee.  All donations collected at the door go directly to the performer and all food donations go directly to the  Church Youth Group.  No financial or other consideration was received by anyone other than the artist and Church  Youth Group in connection with this event.

Covenant Support Committee  - Frank Soper  As we approach the end of the current term  for the members of the Covenant Support  Committee, we want to express our appreciation  to the vast majority of residents who fully  cooperated to correct a covenant violation when  advised of the violation.  During this term it was only necessary to  involve the SHHA attorney four times to assure  compliance. We prefer to avoid the unnecessary  expense involved, but we will continue to  enforce covenant compliance via legal means  when dealing with a violator who chooses non- compliance.  We have recently noticed a significant  increase in complaints referencing to parts of  the proposed Unified Covenants (UCs) when  reporting a violation. Until these are legally  adopted the original covenants are the only  criteria for enforcement.  We plan to conduct the residents outreach  town hall meetings in September, followed by  balloting for the UCs in October.

Your vulnerability should not be ignored. Threat assessment is a  means for you to calmly evaluate your risks.    9 Sliding glass doors offer easy access if not properly secured. You can secure  them by installing commercially available locks or placing a broomstick or  wooden dowel in the inside track to jam the door.  9 When you go out of town, give your house the “lived in look” by setting a few of your lights on  timers. Stop your mail and newspaper delivery or have a trusted neighbor pick it up for you. If  you are a subscriber, call Sandia Heights Security Patrol and advise them of your absence,  they will provide extra patrol.  Ask a trusted neighbor to keep an eye on your home while you  are away.
