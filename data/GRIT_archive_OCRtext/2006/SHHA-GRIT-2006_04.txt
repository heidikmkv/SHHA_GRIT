Friends and relatives of Sandia Heights residents are welcome to attend, along with members of the Church of  the Good Shepherd’s congregation. Our concert will only be advertised in the GRIT, the Church of the Good  Shepherd newsletter, and via flyers at the church and local businesses.     About Lisa….Vermont singer/songwriter Lisa McCormick lights up the room with an unforgettable  performance of spicy upbeat originals on acoustic guitar and vocals. Her seasoned ease on stage and sharp  sense of humor complement her finely-tuned songwriting, with influences ranging from Bossa Nova to  Contemporary Folk/Pop. Her newest CD, Mystery Girl, reflects recent travels in Europe and Latin America.  Her songs are playfully bohemian, and richly infused with sultry jazz and spicy Latin stylings. Lisa has won  two grand-prize songwriting awards and frequently opens for Jonathan Edwards. Check out her website and  listen to her music at www.lisamccormick.com.    A donation of $15, $10/seniors & teens, $5 children (under 6 free) is suggested, and attendees may contribute  what they can afford. Money collected will go to the artist, who is taking a chance on our generosity.     The Church of the Good Shepherd Youth Group will provide coffee, teas and dessert items, which they will  sell for a token amount to raise a little money for their activities. This will be an alcohol-free event that may  be enjoyed by people of all ages.    We can use a few volunteers to help the day of the show. Please contact Coffeehouse Chair Linda Bolton at  856-7100 or nlightsmgt@aol.com. Kerney Bolton can use a couple of volunteers with strong backs to help set  up sound. Contact Kerney at 856-7120 or kernarch@aol.com.    This will be the second Sandia Heights Coffeehouse, taking advantage of national and international artists'  appearances in Albuquerque. Please join us for a wonderful evening!  PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE  Ed Whitten    Capital Outlay request.  Our efforts to acquire funding for various  improvements in Sandia Heights have been  very successful. Our State Legislators,  Representative Bill Rehm, Representative  Kathy McCoy and Senator Kent Cravens  worked together to get a bill passed in the  recent legislative session which will fund  most of the items that the SHHA board had  requested. Bill Rehm and Kathy McCoy  attended our monthly Board meeting in  March and gave the following summary of  what they were able to achieve (note that  only item 5. was vetoed):    1. $450,000 for road resurfacing in  Sandia Heights  2. The State (Highway Department)  has agreed to resurface Tramway  Blvd with rubberized asphalt  (noise abatement asphalt)  3. $200,000 for a noise abatement  wall on Tramway (this may not  be desirable and item 2. may be  an adequate solution to the noise  from Tramway)  4. The state has agreed to work  with us to address signs at the  major entrances to Sandia  Heights.  5. $10,000 to install better turf at  Little Cloud Park (Vetoed)  6. The State (Finance Authority) has  agreed to fund a waste water  study (sewer feasibility study)     7. $50,000 for a special  “Community Policing Rapid  Response” program for special  policing issues just for the  unincorporated North East  heights (i.e. Sandia Heights,  North Albuquerque Acres, etc.)         This program will start July 1. We will  provide more information on the specifics of  this program in the next couple of months.  On behalf of the BOD and all the  residents of Sandia Heights, I would like to  thank our State Representatives Bill Rehm,  and Kathy McCoy, and State Senator Kent  Cravens, for their efforts to help our  community improve. Both Kathy and Bill  reminded us that they are up for re-election  this year.  I also would like to thank those board  members who have worked hard to prepare  the Capital Outlay requests and the up- coming county Capital Improvement  Projects (CIP) requests that are due in May.  Help on the latter is still needed.  One project request that has been  suggested to improve pedestrian safety is the  following: Widen some of the major artery  streets by four feet (likely only two feet on  each side) and place a white stripe on one  side (with possible rumble caps) to allow a  four-foot path. The streets being suggested  are: San Rafael, Tramway Lane, Juniper Hill  Road, Live Oak, and Cedar Hill Road. The  SHHA board does not want to move forward  on this CIP request without community  feedback. If you have concerns or  suggestions, please contact the SHHA  office.     Nominations for Board Directors  Needed  Bill Johnson, Vicki Smidt, Bill McCall   - Nominations Committee         New directors will be elected at the  Annual Meeting on Saturday June 3, 2006.  We need YOU to replace those who are  retiring. Board members are elected for 3- year terms. To preserve the Sandia Heights  we all enjoy and love, serving as a member  of the board is a rewarding opportunity. We  need representation from all of the units on     Continued page 3  The GRIT    Page 2  Continued from page 2    the board and we urge you to consider  taking this opportunity to become a board  member. The next few years will be an  exciting opportunity for you to help plan the  future of our association. Please review the  beige pages of the 2006 Directory of  Residents, which lists the duties of the  committees and other functions of the board.  If you are prepared to serve as a Director,  we urge you to contact Bill Johnson at 821- 5696, or by email at  wjohnson119@comcast.net and submit a  short resume reflecting your experience and  interest in working on the Board of  Directors.    Often potential candidates inquire as to the  time commitment required as a board  member. There is a monthly board meeting  that is approximately 2-3 hours. Each board  member is expected to serve on one or two  SHHA committees. The time dedicated to  committee service varies from committee to  committee. Some committees, such as the  Architectural Control Committee, are more  time consuming than others. Thus, your  selection of committee dictates time  expended. Clearly, none of the committees  require an unreasonable amount of time on  the part of a member. Committees usually  meet once a month and demand several  hours of time commitment.    PARKS & NEW DEVELOPMENT   COMMITTEE  Ed Tull, Chair    School Bus Stop Improvement Competition    In the December and February GRIT, the  SHHA announced that $200 had been  allocated to improve a school bus stop in  Sandia Heights so that children could have a  safer and more pleasant wait every morning.      Congratulations to Aidan Thompson and  Ann Desing! Their collaborative proposal to     install a park bench at the northeast corner  of Marigold Drive and San Rafael was  selected to receive the $200 award.

JACKSON PARK – FINAL  PHASE  Bob Christman    It is a pleasure to inform everyone that the  engineering work has begun on the final phase  of construction to complete this park. All the  funds required have been approved.    Just to refresh your memory, the basketball  and bocce court will be added, along with  another picnic table in the shade structure. The  bocce court will have a 50-foot sidewalk on  each side of the court. Also, there will be  additional benches located along some of the  trails, a permanent park sign and some other  park furnishings.    Many people have commented on how  everyone does their share in keeping the park  clean, including cleaning up after their pets.  The county has provided two doggie depots  and three garbage cans conveniently located,  which helps the cause.    The schedule for construction is not yet  available, but our best guess would be this  summer. We will keep you advised as this  project progresses.

My name is Ray Chavez and I am  currently a Detective with the Community Policing  Unit. I have been with the Bernalillo County  Sheriff’s Department for over 7 years.     One day on patrol I made a car stop on a vehicle  that had been reported stolen. The driver of the  vehicle was arrested and I had started my interview  with the offender. He said he was down on his luck  and he had no place to stay for the night. He  expressed that he was not a bad person and did not  have a violent history. He said he was walking  down a residential street and noticed a long dark  driveway, and he noticed a vehicle at the end of the  driveway, parked in front of the residence. He  walked to the vehicle and to his surprise the door  was unlocked. The offender said it was cold and he  wanted to sleep in the car for the night. When he sat  down, he leaned the seat back to get comfortable.  The offender said he felt something on the  floorboard and lifted up the mat. It was the keys to  the car. He was not going to take the car but thought  it could be his shelter for future cold nights, so he  started the vehicle and left the area.     The offender was charged and prosecuted for the  crimes he committed. Stealing is stealing and it is  wrong no matter what the circumstances are! I ask  you, what if the residence had a motion light? What  if the motion light came on when the car thief  approached the dark driveway? What if the doors of  the vehicle were locked or if that extra set of keys  were not underneath the mat? Would it have made a  difference? Absolutely!     A few things to remember. Always lock your car  and the doors to your home, even if you are to be  away for a just a few minutes. If you have an alarm  system, always activate it. Install motion lights and  keep your house well lit. Stay alert and take action  before, not after something happens. You live in a  good neighborhood and the Sheriff’s Department is  committed to keeping it that way. Report suspicious  activity to 798-7000, and in case of an emergency,  dial 911. Feel free to contact me at my office if you  have any questions or concerns 314-0038.

Crime Prevention Tips  from the Sandia  Heights Security Patrol:    Crime exists. Your vulnerability should not be  ignored. Threat assessment is a means for you to  calmly evaluate your risks.    9 Never hide house keys under the door mat or  a rock near your door. Most burglars know  that trick. Instead, give your key to a trusted  neighbor.  9 All outside doors to your house should be  metal or solid wood.

GREAT IDEA.    Develop a unique residential community in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains.  That was a bold concept in 1965 when the first unit in the Sandia Heights Subdivision  Got underway. And to preserve the integrity of this stunning environment, the first set of covenants  was also established. But additional land was purchased “piecemeal” over a long period of time. As  new units were developed new guidelines were enacted as needed. Unfortunately, established  guidelines were never updated. This explains the numerous versions of covenants now controlling  the Sandia Heights Community.    Does the system work?  IT’S BROKEN. LET’S FIX IT.    Not easy but necessary. Unifed Covenants are standard for every community that recognizes the  overall benefits and positive impact on property values for homeowners. Because of its unique  evolutions, not all Sandia Heights units are created equal. A restriction in one unit may not apply to a  neighbor across the street. Confusing. Frustrating. The time to resolve the issue is long overdue, and  the SHHA has worked tirelessly to finalize and approve a Declaration of Unified Covenants. The  next step is to bring the matter to the residents for a vote this year. To learn more about covenants  and Sandia Heights history, visit the SHHA website at www.sandiahomeowners.org. Additional  information regarding the voting procedures, timing and related event will be available soon.
