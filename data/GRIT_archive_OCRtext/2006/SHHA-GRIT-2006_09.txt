On  Saturday evening, September 30, the Santa Cruz River  Band will return from their annual concert tour in  Europe to perform at our Sandia Heights Coffeehouse  at 7:30 p.m., Church of the Good Shepherd, 7834  Tennyson NE.     Come join your Sandia Heights friends and neighbors  for a relaxed, enjoyable evening of music,  conversation, and coffee, teas & desserts.  Bring the  kids!  This will be an all-ages, alcohol-free event.     At this, our third Coffeehouse, we will host the  region’s premier southwestern folk music band.  The  Santa Cruz River Band delivers a beautiful, intriguing, and powerful musical blend of traditional and  contemporary songs in English, Spanish, and Native American Tribal tongues accompanied by  traditional and contemporary guitars, mandolin, and banjo.  Their music is both authentic and original  and routed in the traditional styles of the Southwest and Mexico. Their songs are interlaced with stories  drawn from the early memories and personal family histories of the band members as passed down to  them through the generations. Band members are Michael J. Ronstadt, Ted Ramírez and Gilbert Brown.   Michael Ronstadt shares the talents of a family that includes well-known sister Linda. Read about the  band and listen to their music on www.santacruzriverband.com.    Suggested entertainment donations: $15, $10/seniors & teens, $5 children 6 and older.  Refreshments by  Church of the Good Shepherd Youth Group, food donations go to church youth activities.  Please contact  Linda Bolton at 856-7100 or nlightsmgt.com to volunteer.  The Little GRIT     Page 2  Community Services &  Membership Committee:   Vicki Criel, Chair    Letters to the Committee:  I wanted to say that I very much enjoyed the  Jazz Night on 7/15.  This event not only gave  all of us a chance to listen to some good music  in a beautiful setting, but we also got the  opportunity to meet some of our neighbors,  whom we otherwise would not have met. I  met several people and later ran into one of  the people I met at Whole Foods.  Without the  opportunity to meet her at the July 15th event,  we would have passed each other by. We are a  large community and the chance to meet at  Association events is a good thing!! The more  neighbors who know each other, the more  pleasant the atmosphere of our community,  and the better the likelihood of solving  conflicts. I'm glad to see that other events are  scheduled in the near future, and I want to  thank the people who are working on these  events.    Marge Bernstein    Please accept my gratitude for your efforts in  organizing Jazz Night last Saturday.  It was  quite an enjoyable affair, and a most pleasant  way to spend a summer evening. Not in the  least, it also provided everyone with a  congenial forum to meet and socialize with  their neighbors and fellow homeowners, an  opportunity that I otherwise find quite elusive.  I encourage you to continue to put on  functions such as this. Again, my sincere  thanks.      James M. Skorich    Committee Notes:  The SHHA Jazz Nites are FREE events for all  Sandia Heights residents. The musicians are  often Sandia Heights residents. The events are  usually at the Four Seasons Pool and Tennis  Club or at the SHHA office courtyard on San  Rafael.

Please contact Chairperson Vicki Criel at  vcriel@comcast.net or 615-3333 for additional  information. The SHHA Coffeehouse is  typically held in the fall at a local church.

There have been several burglaries in the  Sandia Heights area. The burglar has entered through unlocked  doors (sliding glass and garage side doors) while occupants were  sleeping. The burglar is interested in ladies' purses and men's  wallets (from which he extracted all cash, and then dumped all  credit cards and other items in various places) and personal  computers. The Bernalillo County Sheriff has informed us that this  burglar is very brazen about entering, seems to be only interested  in cash, leaves your doors propped open so he can easily exit, and  seems to only enter through unlocked doors (not breaking windows  or doors down). We cannot emphasize enough for people to lock  their doors even when they are home.    Revised Update – Don Wortman  In the June publication we reported that a Taekwondo studio would  be occupying the southern two retail spaces in the Pinon Square  building on Tramway next to the $1.75 Cleaners, and that by  January the owner of the building hoped to have a restaurant in that  space. Instead, the Taekwondo studio, SOUTHWICK’S BLACK  BELT ACADEMY, will be the permanent resident of that space.

My father was my mentor and my  education has been at Southern CT. State  University. I have 20 years teaching  experience. I work in mixed media and  create spiritual portraits at fairs and special  events. I also facilitate empowerment  classes and workshops with emphasis on  visual art/collage.      Lynda Burch, 369 Big Horn Ridge Dr.   My lifetime retirement dream has been to learn to paint and to do so  in watercolors. Ten  years ago I decided I couldn’t wait for  retirement (I’m still not there), so I began from zero taking classes.   Lots of teachers and workshops later,  I finally began to feel creative and  my art appears in Yucca Gallery.and  Amapola Gallery, both in Old Town.   I am a member of many  organizations and have been juried  into many regional and national  shows.    Barbara Nahler  I begin my paintings with unprimed canvas which I manipulate by  stretching, sometimes adding yarn to it to  make more design. To make the canvas  ready for painting, I gesso the entire surface.    The manipulation of the canvas usually  dictates how it is to be painted. To finish, I  sometimes add copper foil or coffer dust. I  also work with colored pencils and do  mostly realistic subject in this medium.      Kit Langdon  I have been studying at various classes since childhood, but I  became serious about my art as an adult and attended the College of  the Redwoods at the Mendocino,  CA Art Center. I have been  painting with various media (oil,  watercolor, etching and pastels)  since then, but have recently  settled mainly on pastels. I enjoy  using a variety of styles and  subjects for my work.      Barb Boedeker, 147 Whitetail Rd  In my work, I try to capture the simplicity and feeling of primitive  art forms (mostly Native American) and present them in a modern  way. I draw inspiration from petroglyphs, pictographs, painted hides,  sand paintings as well as pottery, especially the pottery of the  Mimbres. I am also inspired by the prehistoric painted caves of  France (several of which I had the opportunity to visit last year).  I  use acrylic paints and a wax  resist technique to achieve the  unique style of my paintings.   Special orders are welcome  and can be customized to your  specifications regarding size,  colors and content.    Fred Miller  Fred Miller studied with numerous nationally know artists. He is  founder of the Art Studio, not-for-profit cooperative of artists whose  mission is to further art education, and he  teaches portraiture and drawing. His  paintings have won numerous nationally  juried awards.

George Hight   A New Mexican Native from Gallop –  Retired photographer and artist. He started  his career with Convair during WW2 as an  illustrator and coordinator. He paints  southwest landscapes and miniature oils.   His works can be found in homes across  the US, Europe and Asia. He is presently  associated with Yucca Art Gallery in old  town.      Sheila Richmond, 70 Pinion Hill Place  I work in both oils and pastels. People, in their varied postures and  activities, seem to call for me to use oils, and landscapes bespeak  pastels. I continue to be fascinated by the varied landscape of the  Southwest. Every season shows something  which I want to capture and share through  pastels. In each medium, I hope to evoke an  answering response from the viewer which  is meaningful to both of us. I continue to be  fascinated by the varied landscape of the  Southwest. Every season shows something  which I want to capture and share through  pastels and oils.
