The Little GRIT     Page 2  Message from the President  By Ed Whitten    State and County Funding Requests    Several SHHA board members have been  very busy recently submitting Capital  Outlay request to our state representatives,  Kathy McCoy and Bill Rehm. Requests  were submitted just before the legislative  session started. Many of these requests are  very vital to our community for safety and  quality of life. The requests varied from re- surfacing of many of the streets in Sandia  Heights, re-surfacing of Tramway Blvd with  rubberized asphalt for noise abatement,  feasibility and cost analysis of a sewer  system, replacement of signage at major  entrances in Sandia Heights, and pathway  projects. Although we are not too optimistic  about receiving funding for all these  projects, we certainly won’t get funding  without asking.     We are in the midst of preparing Capital  Improvement Projects (CIP) for input to the  county due this spring. The requests for CIP  funding are similar to the state Capital  Outlay requests.     You can help in this effort by providing  requests for roads in your neighborhood that  need resurfacing. Please let the office know  these locations.    It is the intent of the SHHA Board of  Directors (BOD) to be more proactive on  seeking state and county funding to improve  our community. We hope that our recent  activities will be a pattern for the future.   Help in lobbying for these requests is always  welcomed.    Wastes Water Ordinance Status  The County Waste Water Ordinance was  passed on January 24 as anticipated. It goes  into effect February 27, 2006. The following  are a few last minute questions and answers  regarding the ordinance:    1. Are there only two companies that  can install alternative wastewater  systems in the area? There are  several companies that can install  and maintain these systems at this  time. In 2007, installers will need to  get a certification from the State to  install septic systems. There are two  categories and the Installer 2  category will be the one that can  install alternative systems. This will  require some experience installing  septic systems and most installers  should be able to achieve the  Installer 2 certification.  2. How was this Ordinance  advertised? The County advertised  the public meetings in the  Albuquerque Journal, the County  website, and on GOV-TV.  In  addition, a copy of the advertisement  was sent to each neighborhood  association.  3. Has anyone compared the cost of  sewer installation in Sandia  Heights versus upgrading septic  systems? There has been no study  completed to date. The topography  in some portions of Sandia Heights  could make the installation of a  sewer system very expensive in  some locations.  In addition, not  every lot requires the installation of  an alternative treatment system.   Those lots that do require an  alternative treatment unit in 2015  may be eligible for a variance to this  requirement based on annual water  usage. These variances would be  valid until the property is sold. (See  also Capital Outlay Request in the  previous article)  If there are any further questions,  residents can call the Office of  Environmental Health at 314-0310.  The Little GRIT     Page 4  Speed Humps  In response to many residents with concerns about the county speed hump request/installation  procedures, the County has scheduled a Town Hall meeting for March 28 at 7:00 pm at the  William Sibrava Substation (Eubank and Holly). The purpose of the meeting is to address "Total  Community Involvement in Speed Hump Installation Decisions." The proper county officials  will be invited (Fire dept, Public works, County Commissioner, etc.) If you have an interest in  this issue, please plan to attend.

The Little GRIT    Page 7  Crime Prevention  Tips from the  Sandia Heights  Security Patrol:  Crime exists. Your  vulnerability should not be  ignored. Threat assessment is a means  for you to calmly evaluate your risks.  9 There is very little Sandia Heights  Security can do about solicitors. The  County does not require a permit, but  the city does. If you do not want to be  bothered by solicitors, place a “no  solicitation” sign in a conspicuous  place. Then, if someone approaches,  we can tell them to leave.  9 While walking, avoid isolated areas.  Walk confidently and with another  person when possible. Do not carry a  lot of cash and avoid wearing anything  that would attract a lot of attention.  Wear light colored or reflective  material at night and be sure to  always walk with a partner if you do  walk in the evenings.

If you  did not receive yours, please notify the office.   We found a couple of misprints in the directory. On page RG-16 it is written incorrectly  that being a member of SHHA does include security. This is NOT correct. Membership in  SHHA does NOT automatically mean you are receiving services from SH Security. Sandia  Heights Security offers a private Community Patrol Service on a subscription basis and you may  call them at 856-6347 to join.  We also noticed that certain address numbers on numerical pages 26 and 38 were printed  incorrectly, although in the alphabetical section they are printed correctly. We are researching  the database to correct this error. I apologize for the errors.  If your listing is incorrect, please either call or email the office with your corrections.
