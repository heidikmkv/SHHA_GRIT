  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                      July 2006      President’s Message by Dick Cline    I would like to thank all who attended the annual meeting on June 3.  We had  a good turnout and accomplished several objectives.  Six new directors for the  SHHA Board of Directors (BOD) were voted in. The BOD welcomes Sy Caudill,  Deborah Branningan Liebner, Burt O’Neil, Suzanne Popejoy, Sue Tombaugh, and Mike Winokur.  Kerney Bolton and Ed Whitten were elected for a second 3-year term. Ed Tull & Gene Church were  re-elected for a 3-year term. We look forward to their contributions in the upcoming year.  Several board members whose terms expired and those who resigned during the past year were  recognized.  The following individuals contributed greatly to our community and the BOD: Dick  Brackett, Rick Fairbanks, Mona Lee Schilling, Glen Cheney, and Mark Boslough.  We thank you.   The recommended changes to the bylaws were ratified. The copy of bylaws changes given at the  Annual Townhall meeting had some typos in them. We apologize for the error. The official copy that  was approved can be found on the SHHA website at www.sandiahomeowners.org.  All of our seven standing committees were very busy this past year and a summary of their  various activities was presented.  Most all of these committees could use more volunteers to help  with their projects.  If you or someone you know could contribute, please contact anyone on the  board.  There is a particular need for people to help on the Community Service & Membership  Committee (CS&M), the Architectural Control Committee (ACC), and the Communications &  Publications Committee.  These committees can use people involved in community activities, who  have any building experience, and communication/internet/web site experience.  I would encourage  anyone with an interest in these areas to volunteer.   Copies of the committee annual reports are  available at the SHHA office.   A Town Hall meeting followed the formal BOD meeting.  I appreciate those individuals who  spoke out on the various concerns of our SHHA community.  Several areas of concern came up –  barking dogs, covenant enforcement, emergency response times, mandatory SHHA membership,  mandatory security service membership, noise walls along Tramway Blvd/views, speed  humps/speeding, and pedestrian responsibility.  I plan on encouraging the BOD to solicit more community input into our major decisions, by  sending out questionnaires on these and other areas of concern. In fact, one of the most significant  changes to the Bylaws this year was to allow SHHA non-board members, who are on committees,  the chance to vote.  If you have an area of concern, please contact us at the office or e-mail at  shha@sandiahomeowners@org.  We continue to welcome your input and I look forward to working  with the BOD to bring our community closer together.    Financial Note: The audit of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) financial  records for 2005 has been completed. The financial records and accounting procedures are in  accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures.     We conducted our audit of the internal control over the SHHA financial practices and procedures.  We plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal  control over financial practices is maintained. A copy of the audit is available for review at the  SHHA office. - Robert Francis  The Little GRIT                                Page 2  SANDIA MOUNTAIN   BEARWATCH TIPS FOR LIVING  WITH BEARS.   •  DON’T FEED A BEAR – EVER….A FED  BEAR IS A DEAD BEAR!  •  Keep trash in a bear-proof garbage container or  stored in a sturdy metal shed or closed garage.   Put out garbage only on morning of pickup.   •  Keep pet dishes and pet food indoors.    •  Stop feeding birds during summer months.  There is plentiful food available in the wild.   Or, hang feeders from wires between tree limbs  10 ft. up, 10 ft. apart.  Bring in hummingbird  feeders at night. Store birdseed in a closed  container indoors.    •  Store barbeque grills inside.  •  Keep kitchen windows and doors closed on  summer nights.  •  Remove fruit before it ripens to stop bears from  climbing and breaking branches.  Remove  fallen fruit. Don’t add melon rinds or fruit to  compost pile except in winter.  •  Don’t leave food, groceries, pet food, or  birdseed in your car overnight.  •  Don’t feed other wildlife, as it will attract bears  too. It is against the law to feed wildlife.  •  Keep all poisons inside your house. Also, many  bears die from ingesting garbage bags.    Call Sandia Mountain BearWatch for advice on co- existing with bears at 505-281-9282 or visit their  website at http://SandiaMountainBearWatch.org.      FIRE ADVISORY:   The Forest Service has closed the  Sandia Wilderness area because  the dead fir trees represent a fire  hazard. Rangers are monitoring  the area, but if you see any sign of fire  then their advice is to call 911. They also suggest  you check your roof to be sure it is free of  flammable debris. And, if your property is full of  non-native ‘cheat’ grass (about 18” tall with a  purple hue), you should replace it with native  grasses or remove it. Cheat grass is very flammable  and is easily ignited by a vehicle’s catalytic  converter. So park cars and trucks on concrete and  not near grass. Weedeaters and lawn mowers and  chain saws also produce sparks. Please keep the  above comments in mind. They are brought to you  from Mr. Alan Kelso, a silviculturist (tree & forest  specialist) working for the Forest Service in Tijeras  and me, a SHHA member who tried to put his  spoken comments to print as best I could. I  personally think we should support a ban on  fireworks, as Santa Fe has done.
