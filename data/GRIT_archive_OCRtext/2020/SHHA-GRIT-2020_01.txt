    SHHA Office Has Moved!  (2B, Then Not 2B)  By Susan McCasland, SHHA Board Secretary    By the time you read this, the SHHA office at 2B San Rafael, aka 12760B San  Rafael, will have closed. The office will open after the holiday break on Jan- uary 2 at its new location about 100 yards away: 12700 San Rafael, Suite  4—in the Quail Run Center, soon to be renamed Sandia Heights Village.  This is a temporary location while the new permanent location next door  in Suite 3 is finished for us.  The SHHA office has been at 2B San Rafael for 20 years. Why move now?  There were a number of factors, but the principal ones were that the new  location will  • Have more and easier parking, including 2 reserved spaces   • Have better handicapped parking  • Be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  Come by and visit the new office in the temporary Suite 4 location and,  even better, in a couple of months visit the new permanent location in  Suite 3!            2020 SHHA Annual Meeting    Saturday, February 22, 9:00 AM – noon. Doors open  at 8:30.    Church of the Good Shepherd, 7834 Tennyson St NE    There will be a business meeting followed by a  town-hall style membership engagement meeting.  The SHHA Board wants to hear from the commu- nity—YOU!!! Come and make your input known.    O’Bean’s coffee, tea, and pastries will be available.    Full agenda will be in next month’s GRIT.

There are 38 different Units within the Sandia Heights com- munity, and no two sets of covenants are exactly the same.  This diversity in our covenants makes community-wide en- forcement difficult at best. In addition, the CSC does not pa- trol throughout Sandia Heights looking for covenant viola- tions. As such, the CSC has developed procedures that de- pend on members of the SHHA to report covenant violations.  Who can report a violation? First, you must be a property  owner in Sandia Heights and be a member of SHHA in order  to submit a covenant violation form. The covenant violation  form (Report of Suspected Covenant Violation) is available at  the SHHA office and from the SHHA website. Although the  CSC does not act on anonymous complaints, your anonymity  as the complainant will be shielded unless future court action  requires that your identity be revealed. Historically, court ac- tions of this nature are very rare. Any SHHA member may  submit a covenant violation form, however, the CSC normally  will act on submissions from residents in the same Unit  where the violation exists, in an adjacent Unit, or in direct line  of sight of the violation regardless of the Unit you reside in.  The CSC will exercise its discretion as to whether or not to act  on violations outside of the normal guidelines.  What information is needed on the violation form? Infor- mation listing you as the complainant is on the form since the  CSC may want to contact you for additional details related to  your complaint. The specific violation and its location need to  be identified, along with the rationale supporting your belief  that a violation has occurred. It helps to identify the specific  paragraph in the applicable Unit covenants that you think is  being violated. The covenants for the Unit where the alleged  violation is occurring are on the website and the office can  also help you identify applicable covenants. The form asks if  you have contacted the violator, but this contact is not a re- quirement in order to submit the form. The CSC is very sensi- tive about not creating an adversarial relationship between  the complainant and the potential violator. You may choose  to talk to your neighbor to try to resolve the violation first,  but as stated previously, the CSC does not require or  recommend this one-on-one contact. The last item required  is your signature. The SHHA staff recognizes electronic sig- natures that include the member’s e-mail address. As stated  before, the CSC will not respond to complaints submitted by  phone calls, notes, or anonymously.  How does the CSC handle the complaint? A member of  the CSC will be assigned to investigate the complaint and to  try to resolve it. The member first assesses the validity of the  complaint by verifying the information submitted on the vi- olation form. If the complaint is deemed invalid the complain- ant will be notified by mail and the file will be closed. If it is  clear that a valid violation exists, the committee member will  complete an investigative report. The violator will receive  written notification from the CSC regarding the specific vio- lation and will be given a reasonable deadline by which to  remedy it. The member will follow up with the violator to en- sure that the violation is corrected in accordance with the  stated timeline. If the violation is successfully resolved at this  point, both parties will be notified by mail and the file will be  closed. If, however, the violation is not resolved as a result of  the first letter, a second letter is sent to the violator with an  additional timeline for resolution and a warning that failure  to comply may result in legal action. If the second letter is  unsuccessful in solving the violation, the file will be turned  over to the SHHA attorney for further action.  Why should you care about covenant enforcement? Resi- dent surveys conducted over the years have consistently in- dicated that the primary goal of SHHA should be the enforce- ment of our covenants. The covenants were designed to ben- efit all property owners in Sandia Heights in order to pre- serve and maintain the beauty, quality of life, and property  values in this unique community. The SHHA and the CSC ac- tively seek your support for the enforcement of our cove- nants. This is your community and your covenants and every- one appreciates your compliance.    Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  Needs Volunteers  The CSC needs new members to help enforce the covenants  for the Sandia Heights community. The results from the last  SHHA Annual Meeting and recent surveys have consistently  shown that covenant enforcement is a high priority for  homeowners. If you are a homeowner and dues paying mem- ber of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA)  please consider volunteering for your Covenant Support  Committee and help ensure the enforcement of SHHA cove- nants. We meet at the SHHA office once a month, and we  have the excellent support of our SHHA staff. Covenant en- forcement contributes significantly to preserving our beauti- ful and unique community. Please share your appreciation of  the Sandia Heights community and join the CSC.  You can volunteer by calling the SHHA office at (505) 797- 7793 or by sending an email to sandiaheights@comcast.net.   Reminder:  Trimming your trees and shrubs is best  done during the cold winter months when the vege- tation is dormant.  This minimizes shock to the trees  and also gives the open cut time to heal without the  problem of infecting bugs and beetles.    3   The GRIT – January 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 1  A Food Recycling Service Now Available  in Sandia Heights  Did you know that there is a new recycling service that  picks up at your door? It’s for food scraps and organic  waste and it’s called Little Green Bucket. You can have  weekly, biweekly, or monthly pickups. There is a fee for  this private service. Little Green Bucket takes 100% of  the food waste collected to Soilutions’ compost facility  in the South Valley, where it is recycled into nutrient-rich  compost products and sold back to local farmers and  gardeners. And Little Green Bucket returns a bag of  compost to you quarterly or, if you don’t need it, you  can have them donate it to a local food-growing charity.

Martin Luther King Day—January 20 Excerpted from The King Center website  During the less than 13 years of Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.’s leadership of the modern American Civil Rights  Movement, from December 1955 until April 4, 1968, Af- rican Americans achieved more genuine progress to- ward racial equality in America than in the previous 350  years. Dr. King is widely regarded as America’s pre-emi- nent advocate of nonviolence and one of the greatest  nonviolent leaders in world history.  Drawing inspiration from both his Christian faith and  the peaceful teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. King led  a nonviolent movement in the late 1950s and ’60s to  achieve legal equality for African-Americans in the  United States. While others advocated for freedom by  “any means necessary,” including violence, Martin Lu- ther King, Jr. used the power of words and acts of non- violent resistance, such as protests, grassroots organiz- ing, and civil disobedience to achieve seemingly-impos- sible goals. He led similar campaigns against poverty  and international conflict, always maintaining his princi- ples that men and women everywhere, regardless of  color or creed, are equal members of the human family. The Nitty Gritty on  (Historical article reprinted from Spring 1999 GRIT)  It was a simple question. Why did they call it The Grit?  There were a few opinions but no one knew for sure.  And there were a lot of questions. “Wasn’t there a  newspaper in the old west by that name? Weren’t there  several? Isn’t it a generic name like Journal or Sentinel or  Tribune? And by the way, who were they, anyway?”  A few phone calls produced an incomplete list of past  editors of the Sandia Heights Grit going back to about  ’74 or ’75…maybe. Seems that’s when the Grit got  started as a single page flyer, run off on an old Gastet- ner and hand delivered to the handful of pioneers living  here at the time. By collective vote, it was named The  Grit because it was, in fact, pretty gritty up here when  the wind blew. Now if anybody has a better story or  wants to expand on the myth, feel free to contact the  editor. [ed., That still goes for today.]  The True Grit  There is another Grit. The true Grit one would guess be- cause it predates ours by over 100 years. Seems there was  this German immigrant, Dietrick Lamonde, who started  the whole thing in Williamsport, PA, back in 1882. The con- cept was to print only the “good news,” and appeal to ru- ral tastes and traditions. It became a weekly distributed by  a nationwide network of young carriers. It promoted  peace, good will, courage, strength and happy thoughts.  “Make every issue ring the joy bells of life,” was it’s [sic]  motto. Really.  And it’s still around today. Owned by Ogden Publica- tions out of Topeka, Kansas. And by golly, they’ve even  got a web site and an 800 number. When I called and  asked about the origins of the name, I got, “Not sure,  probably had to do with the dirt in the air.”  Type of Violation  Number of  Active Files  Boats/RV/Trailer  2  Maintenance of Property  Trash Cans  Lights  Trees  Right-of-Way Issues  Parked Vehicles or Equip.  1  Misc./Several Issues  1  After 2½ years of dedicated service in the  SHHA office, Jessica Seeley has moved on.

Sandia Peak Ski Area & Ski History  By Susan McCasland, Comm & Pubs Committee Chair    How many other major-city neighborhoods have a ski  area in their back yard? A 15-minute tram ride puts you  at the top of the Sandia Peak Ski Area, which is  projected to open January 5 this season.  Sandia Peak has 39 runs, with the longest traversing  2 miles, which makes for quite a long cruiser! The area  has 5 lifts, 1700 feet of vertical and 200 acres of skiable  terrain. It is the oldest ski area in New Mexico. The first  runs were cleared in 1935 and it was then called La  Madera Ski Area. But skiing in the Sandias goes back  even further. There is a photo from 1896 of a skier at the  Ellis Ranch. If you’re interested in the history of skiing in  New Mexico, then the New Mexico Ski Museum is for  you—and it’s even closer than the ski area. The  museum, open daily, is free and is located at the base of  the tram. For further information on the museum, see  http://www.nmskihall.org and on the ski area, including  which, if any, lifts are running, see  https://www.skinewmexico.com/resorts/sandia-peak/                                                   9 The GRIT - January 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 1 10 The GRIT - January 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 1 11   The GRIT – January 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 1  Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We meet on the second Saturday of every other month, starting  in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6-8 people, including the  hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host  decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal – along  with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the  dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season  gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights.  Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.  2020 Resident Guide and Directory Cover  Photo Winner!
