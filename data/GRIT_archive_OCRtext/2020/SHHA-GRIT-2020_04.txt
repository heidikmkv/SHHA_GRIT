By the time you receive it in early  April, there will no doubt be much that has happened and that we can’t  yet predict. “Social distancing” is the word of the day. To that end, in  March the SHHA trash pickup, Crime Risk Management Seminar and Cork  & Fork dinner were cancelled. The tram and Ten3 Restaurant closed. In  April, the Easter Egg Hunt is cancelled (see Coldwell Banker ad for details).  Please try to stay home as much as possible (fortunately we have lovely  homes to stay in). When you must go out, avoid touching hard surfaces  such as door handles, elevator buttons, escalator rails, chair arms unless  you disinfect them first. Wash your hands frequently.  Can’t find sanitizing wipes at the store? Here’s an effective and easy way  to carry some with you. Go to your rag bin and get a clean undershirt or  something similar, preferably cotton. Cut it into roughly 4”x 4” squares.  Fold the squares and put them in a snack-size, sealable plastic bag. Now  pour in just enough bleach to dampen the cloth squares. You now have  effective, disposable disinfectant wipes to take with you. Just be careful  not to get bleach on colored fabric and limit skin contact.    Census Reminder    By now you should have received one or possibly more census letters in  the mail. You can complete the census on-line, by telephone, by mail, or by  waiting for a census taker to visit your home because they haven’t heard  from you. With coronavirus among us, please promptly use one of the first  three, remote response methods. It only takes about 10 minutes.  And please respond, as having an accurate count is very important. Vot- ing districts are reapportioned based on the count which is vital to ensure  citizens are properly represented, states receive federal funds based on  population counts, and it’s required in the Constitution that our citizens be  counted every 10 years. Be a responsible citizen—be counted.    Welcome, Jennifer    Jennifer Craft joined Betsy Rodriguez in the SHHA office in February. She  was raised in Houston, TX, and lived there for 22 years before moving to  Roswell. There she worked for Bell Gas Inc/Cortez Gas Co. After 18 years in  Roswell, she moved to Albuquerque for the job opportunities. Jennifer  says, “I am very excited to have found an employment home at Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association.” If you’re in the SHHA office, please say  “hi” to Jennifer—from a distance, of course. Maybe an elbow bump.  2   The GRIT – April 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 4  Questions from the Annual Meeting    Residents raised several questions in the membership  participation portion of the SHHA Annual Meeting in  February. Here are some answers.  “Operating expenses constitutes more than half of  the total expenses on the Income Statement. What is  included under Operating Expense?” Answered by  Cheryl Iverson, SHHA Treasurer. That’s a great question.  Operating Expense includes the following: phone & in- ternet, copier lease, utilities, office lease, office staff sal- aries, postage, mileage, office security upgrades, and  office supplies.  Parks & Safety Committee chair Travis Rich received  a number of questions that fit into three general areas.  Here are his responses to those areas:  1. Infrastructure repair and normal wear and tear has  left some of our roads in need of maintenance and/or  repair. A list of some of these sites is being assembled,  location identified, and this info will be shared with the  proper authorities and/or agencies to assist them in es- tablishing road-repair priorities. Sandia Heights Services  is responsible for the infrastructure and Bernalillo  County is responsible for roads. If you wish to report an  issue for the list, send it to the SHHA office staff (atten- tion Parks & Safety) with the following info: street  name, nearest street address, and nature of needed re- pair (e.g., pot hole, 3-inch-wide crack, etc.).  2. SHHA has entered into an “Adopt-A-Highway”  agreement with New Mexico Department of Transpor- tation for trash pickup along Tramway. Our assigned  section of NM 556 (Tramway) is between mile-markers  8 and 9, roughly from Paseo del Norte, south to Simms  Park Road. Because of the popularity of the Balloon Fi- esta and the vast number of visitors to our community  during the event, we arbitrarily choose a date immedi- ately preceding that event and then approximately 6  months later to achieve our 2x-per-year commitment.  Other community groups are responsible for other  parts of NM 556. Trash cleanup of individual streets in- side residential areas is and should be the responsibility  of those residents.  3. Some have asked about installing “speed bumps”  for the purpose of speed containment. We’ve learned  two lessons about these: first was that apparently the  proper word for these is “traffic calming devices”; we  do not have speed bumps! And second is that a resident  on that road—not the HOA—must request a study of  the need. Contact Bernco Division of Public Works,  (505) 848-1500.  Responsibilities of the SHHA     Woody Farber, the SHHA President, presented a list of  the actions and activities that are the responsibility of  the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. As a fol- low-up, he also showed the things the SHHA can’t do,  with the appropriate agency to contact for that activity.  Here are those useful lists.    What SHHA Does  • Approves new construction and changes to existing  structures to ensure compliance with covenants  • Investigates and acts on complaints of covenant vio- lations  • Provides governance and financial management of  the non-profit HOA  • Publishes monthly GRIT newsletter, yearly Directory  and Residents Guide, and SHHA website  • Provides notary service and voter registration  • Maintains books of contractor reviews  • Informs residents of discounts available at participat- ing merchants  • Sends email alerts on road blockages, GRIT availability,  etc.  • Partners with local business to provide activities for  residents  • Provides residents 8 deeply discounted tram tickets  per day    What SHHA Doesn’t Do—and who does it  • Bernalillo County (Bernco)  o Maintains roads, road margins, road signage, etc.   Including snow removal  o Maintains traffic calming devises, i.e., speed bumps  o Responds to complaints of barking, loose or dan- gerous dogs  • Bernco Sheriff and/or Sandia Heights Security  o Responds to actual or suspected criminal activity   Including tagging and graffiti  o Investigates home alarms  o Responds to traffic accidents  o Patrols neighborhoods  • Sandia Heights Services  o Provides water utility   o Provides sanitation, i.e. trash, recyclables pick-up  • Sandia Heights membership  o Revises or changes covenants    3   The GRIT – April 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 4  Invasive Trees in Sandia Heights  Covenant Support Committee    There is a growing awareness in Sandia Heights that  trees as they grow, proliferate, and mature, are causing  a gradual loss of our valley and mountain views, contrib- uting to mounting water usage and septic system  maintenance costs, and decreasing our property values.  It is important that homeowners know what trees  should be considered weeds in Sandia Heights and how  they can be controlled.  According to Mr. Joran Viers, past horticulturalist for  the Bernalillo County Extension Service, Tree of Heaven  and Siberian Elm should be considered weeds in Sandia  Heights. Siberian elms are considered the greater pre- sent threat.  Siberian Elm  According to Baker H. Morrow, Best Plants for New  Mexico Gardens & Landscapes, Siberian elm is “almost su- pernaturally hardy; thrives in any soil with little or no wa- ter and is not affected by heat or cold.” It “can grow to  80 feet in height, with a 50-foot crown” and “reseeds  itself profusely in early spring.”  The USDA has determined that Siberian elm is suffi- ciently invasive, damaging, and difficult to control to be  deemed a noxious weed. Because it is widespread in  New Mexico, it is classified by the NM Dept of Agricul- ture as a Class C noxious weed.  Our covenants restrict houses to 2 stories or less in  order to be in harmony with the surroundings and so as  not to create an undue obstruction of views. At present,  a few Siberian elms already tower over 2-story houses  and there are hundreds, soon to be thousands, of Sibe- rian elm saplings rapidly growing to join them. It would  be prudent for all of us to be aware of this condition and  to consider effective actions to control this growing  threat to our views and quality of life. Mr. Viers advises  that when removing Siberian elm, the trunk should be  cut as close to the ground as possible and the stump  treated with an herbicide. (Untreated stumps and roots  will sprout new saplings.) He recommends the use of  Garlon-4 to treat the stump. The threat constituted by  the proliferation of Siberian elm is one of the very few  instances he believes where the use of an herbicide is  justified. Garlon-4 can be purchased online and applied  to the freshly cut stump at any time during the year. A  less expensive alternative is sold under the name of the  active ingredient, Triclopyr4.  The Siberian Elm invasion in Sandia Heights in many  ways is comparable with the Salt Cedar invasion of the  Rio Grande Bosque. The salt cedar invasion was allowed  to continue far too long. It is now costing enormous  amounts of money and effort to rid the Bosque of this  weed. If you have Siberian Elm seedlings on your prop- erty it would be a lot easier to remove them now rather  than deal with them later after they have become very  large trees.

Dog  poop is not a natural part of the environment. In addi- tion to being unsightly, runoff from dog waste can im- pact water quality.  A rough estimate is there are 1000+ dogs living in San- dia Heights. That would be about one dog in 50% of the  homes. An online article estimates the average dog pro- duces about ½ pound of poop per day or about 3.5  pounds per week. For our neighborhood, that trans- lates into nearly 2 tons of dog waste per week! Even if  this overestimates the number of dogs in Sandia  Heights, cut it in half, and we are still handling tons of  poop! So, please pick up after your dog!    Dogs Should Be Leashed—Here’s Why  Sandia Heights Resident    I have put off writing this letter for months for fear of  ostracizing friends and neighbors, but after the alterca- tion that took place in Jackson Park (Cedar Hill and  Tramway) on the morning of January 24th, I can no  longer stay silent. I walked down the hill with my  leashed dogs and was immediately approached by two  little out-of-control dogs that went right for my leashed  animals. When I told the couple to put their dogs on a  leash, they called me a “F’ing B@#$%” and to F off and  mind my own business. I told them this was NOT a dog  park and was immediately told that they did not have to  follow the rules as the male has “a Ph.D.” and is exempt.  Most of the dogs at Jackson Park are very friendly  and the owners just want to exercise them, but I did not  create the rules, I only try to enforce them. Bernalillo  County ordinance states that all dogs must be on a leash  and all fecal matter picked up and disposed of properly.  Jackson, Little Cloud and Primrose parks ARE NOT DOG  PARKS!!!!!! If you want your dog to have total freedom,  please go to the dog park on Montgomery just east of  Tramway behind the Police Substation or the one on Pa- seo and Wyoming. They can run free there legally.  We have had two serious injuries at Jackson Park as  a result of loose dogs. One was a lower leg fracture that  resulted in surgery and 8 weeks of complete non- weight bearing and one was caused by a person being  pulled into a pole and having their front teeth knocked  out. This was not a malicious attack as most dogs are  super friendly, but when they get together unleashed  and pack mentality takes over, it can be very dangerous.   I love living in the Heights and my neighbors, for the  most part, are great—but this has to stop. I know of  several people who no longer go to Jackson Park for the  simple reason that their small dogs are afraid of the big- ger, loose animals. PLEASE, keep your dogs leashed and  pick up poop. If this does not work for you, go to a dog  park.     Outdoor Lighting   Joint SHHA/SHS Statement     Among many pleasures of living in Sandia Heights are  the dark skies which allow stargazing, watching the  moon rise over the mountains, and enjoying the distant  sparkling city lights of Albuquerque. This was a quality- of-life issue for the original developers of Sandia  Heights and these activities are possible today, 50 years  later, in large part because of regulations in our Sandia  Heights Unit Covenants that apply to light pollution.  Today, some of our residents are “lighting up” the  outside of their properties to enhance security. The San- dia Heights Unit Covenants do not address security-re- lated issues such as alarms, outdoor cameras, outdoor  lighting, and other methods intended to deter home in- vasions. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  (SHHA) and Sandia Heights Security (SHS) have jointly  agreed that taking measures to secure one’s home is im- portant, so long as these measures are within the  bounds of the Unit Covenants. “Lighting up” is not nec- essarily the best deterrent. As recently determined by  analyses of national crime statistics, most home burgla- ries occur during the day and alarms, cameras, dogs,  and having a TV or radio turned on can be effective de- terrents. SHHA asks all residents to be aware of and fol- low Unit Covenants and the Bernalillo County Ordi- nance for Light Pollution. The County ordinance for  North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights is quite re- strictive, and the County takes enforcement seriously.  When planning to install or replace outdoor lighting,  also consider the impact on your neighbors. Will the  lights shine into their windows? A little consideration  can prevent a complaint to SHHA and/or Bernalillo  County. We have a beautiful and unique neighborhood,  and we work to ensure that we continue to minimize  impact on our natural environment including our lovely  dark skies.    8   The GRIT – April 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 4    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  39 Rock Ridge Drive – Replace Windows and Door  79 Juniper Hill Place – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  99 Juniper Hill Place – Reroof   239 Spring Creek Court – Reroof with Tan TPO  336 White Oaks Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic So- lar Installation  329 Paint Brush Drive – Room Addition  454 Live Oak Road – Addition/Remodel  538 Black Bear Road – Installation of Driveway and  Landscaping  638 Cougar Place – Fence Installation  955 Antelope Avenue – Window Replacement  957 Antelope Avenue – Paint Stucco and Trim  1102 Marigold Drive – Replace Window and Repair  Stucco  1145 Marigold Drive – Wooden Fence Installation  1150 Marigold Drive – Re-Stucco  1183 Laurel Loop – Window Replacement  1199 Bobcat Blvd. – Landscaping and Replace Outdoor  Light Fixtures  1223 Rockrose Road – Paint Stucco, Wood Fence, Gates,  and Reroof  1412 Bluebell Place – Landscaping   1454 Honeysuckle Drive – Reroof  1569 Eagle Ridge Court – Landscaping   1721 Quail Run Court – Hot Tub Platform  2753 Wolfberry Place – Reroof   8212 Indigo Court – Raise Block Wall  9100 Lynx Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel In- stallation  9100 Lynx Loop – Garage Addition with Deck  9512 Ridge Vista Drive – Landscaping Backyard  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to  read about all projects currently under ACC manage- ment.   A Review of the ACC’s Neighborhood  Review Process  By Bob Bower, ACC Chair    I feel that it’s necessary to periodically revisit the ACC’s  Neighborhood Review (NR) process since use of the NR  is an integral part of how the ACC evaluates projects,  particularly those involving large construction efforts.  Our covenants place the authority to evaluate pro- ject applications with the ACC. The ACC uses the NR as a  courtesy to the community as part of its evaluation pro- cess. The NRs are used primarily for informing neigh- bors of a proposed project in their immediate vicinity.  After the ACC determines that a proposed project is in  compliance with applicable covenants, it is then ready  to consider approval of the project. Prior to the ap- proval, a decision may be made to conduct a NR. This  decision is made when the ACC feels that the project  may have an impact on views and on the overall har- mony within the neighborhood.  Once the ACC decides that a NR is appropriate for a  project, the following steps occur:  1. A notification letter is sent to nearby neighbors.  The letter describes the project and advises addressees  that they have seven working days to visit the SHHA of- fice to review the project plans and to respond in writ- ing with comments. These plans normally consist of a  plot plan (usually a property survey) showing the foot- print of the project on the property, a basic floor plan,  and exterior elevation drawings showing the proposed  heights of the completed structure as viewed from dif- ferent directions. Prior to reviewing the NR documents,  NR addressees will be required to sign a form designed  to protect the proprietary nature of the documents.  2. Once all comments are received, the ACC provides  feedback on the project and works with the applicant to  address comments that both parties feel could enhance  the project from a neighborhood point of view.  3. If the ACC feels that comments expressed during  the NR process indicate that there is general unease  within the neighborhood, the ACC schedules a meeting  to allow neighbors to meet with the ACC.  4. Once the ACC has received all comments from the  NR and from any subsequent meetings, the ACC consid- ers all of the comments before making a final decision  on the project. Along with general conditions stated in  all ACC approval letters, specific conditions stemming  from relevant neighborhood comments will be incorpo- rated, as appropriate, in the final approval letter.  The NR process is the product of many years of expe- rience dealing with the community’s need to continually  build,  update,  and modify its residences.

If you  have artistic talent you want to share with others – call Kathleen at (505) 822-0325. Our next meeting is April 6.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We meet on the second Saturday of every other month, starting in Septem- ber, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6-8 people, including the hosts. We try to  switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme  and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal – along with a wine to go with their dish.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole  group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was  started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.  To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.    Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org        …continued from page 8  established to provide overall guidance to property owners  and to maintain control of the various architectural standards  imposed by the covenants. In the beginning, there was no  such “animal” as the NR and it soon became obvious that this  sort of review process was important in order to consider the  impact of a construction project from a neighborhood’s point  of view. The ACC continues to strongly endorse the value of  the NR as a key ingredient of its evaluation process and I en- courage all recipients of a NR notification letter to review the  relevant drawings and plans and to submit comments as ap- propriate. Don’t miss this opportunity and then regret that  you failed to take the time to voice your concerns once the  project has been approved and is underway.    Watch Out for Deer  We all love to see deer wandering through our high-de- sert landscape (though maybe not eating our landscap- ing!). As you no doubt have noticed yourself when sud- denly realizing there is a deer that you hadn’t been able  to see just a moment ago, they are well suited to cam- ouflage here. This can be a hazard to drivers. In addition  to our landscape, deer are in our driveways and streets.  They are the same color as the background and are very  hard to see, especially in low light. Drivers beware!    The Great American Game  By Todd Fielder, SHHA Member    As the days get longer and the temperature begins to  warm, anticipation of the arrival of spring grows. For  millions of children across the United States, that  means the start of little-league baseball and softball.  For Sandia Heights, Altamont Little League is our  assigned division, with leagues for tee-ball through to  baseball and softball divisions. The focus is on fun and  inclusion, with the added benefits of teamwork,  friendly competition, and, of course, learning to play  baseball or softball. In addition to weekly practices  and games, there are other activities to foster child- hood friendships that come with playing team sports.  These include opening weekend festivities such as  bounce houses and dunk tanks, outings to Isotopes  Park, and team dinners under the stars in the baseball  fields.  Perhaps best of all are the memories our children  will carry with them the rest of their lives. I still remem- ber as a little boy the excitement of showing up at the  ballpark—my parents in the stands, friends in the dug- out, the coach on the field. Now, as a father and  coach, I look forward to sharing experiences with my  two young children, and hope they gain the same  memories, friendship, teamwork, and love of baseball  that I did.  Although it might be too late for spring league this  year [ed., not to mention COVID-19], they also offer a  fall league, and there is always next year.
