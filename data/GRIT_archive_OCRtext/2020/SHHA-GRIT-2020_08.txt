Cases were first reported in the city of Wuhan,  China, in December with the first U.S. case confirmed in Seattle on January 20. On  January 3o, the World Health Organization issued a global public health emer- gency, named the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus “COVID-19,” and de- clared a pandemic on March 11. In the U.S., the CDC declared a national emergency  on March 13. In New Mexico beginning March 16, Governor Lujan Grisham issued  a series of Public Health Orders (PHO) affecting mass gatherings, business clo- sures, and other health protocols in an effort to slow the spread. The current PHOs  allow the SHHA office to conduct normal office operations with measures regard- ing visitor capacity, social distancing, hand-sanitizing, and masking. As of this writ- ing, U.S. COVID-19 deaths exceed 130,000, with over 500 here in New Mexico.  The ACC receives about 30 applications each month. There are three ACC forms  for these applications: New Construction & Additions; Miscellaneous Projects; and  Exterior Refinishing, Re-roofing, & Trim Refinishing. Most applications use one of  the latter two forms, which can usually be administratively approved/disapproved  in a few days. The ACC Charter gives the Chair authority to make administrative  approvals/disapprovals without involving the entire committee, though I may re- quest input from one or more committee members. These projects also do not  require neighborhood reviews due to the small area and/or scope of the projects.  For projects submitted on the New Construction & Additions form, the ACC will  usually have a neighborhood review although it is not required by the covenants  but out of courtesy to the community. These are the largest, most extensive pro- jects that the ACC manages and, as such, we feel that the impacts from neighbors’  points of view are important elements of the ACC’s decision. COVID-19 PHOs do  not affect the ACC’s ability to make administrative decisions, but do affect the way  formal neighborhood reviews will be conducted, as described below.  Prior to the COVID-19 PHO restrictions, when the ACC elected to have a neigh- borhood review, a letter describing the project was sent to property owners in the  immediate vicinity, with an invitation to visit the office to review the project plans  and to submit written comments. The addressees had seven working days to re- view the plans and submit comments. After reviewing these comments, the ACC  proceeded with the final phase of evaluation. In rare instances, the ACC decided  to convene a neighborhood meeting of owners who submitted written comments  in order to resolve issues. All members of the ACC are then asked to vote their  approval/disapproval of the project.  When New Mexico’s PHOs required that the SHHA office shut down (mid- March until mid-May), the ACC received one application for new construction and  elected to send courtesy letters to neighbors in lieu of a formal neighborhood re- view. The letters had copies of the project plans and requested that addressees  submit any questions and comments to SHHA. This process worked well for this  particular project.  In mid-May, the SHHA office reopened with limits imposed un-  continued on page 2…  2   The GRIT – August 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 8  …continued from front page  der the current PHOs. Until further notice, neighborhood re- views will be held in a “near-normal” environment with in- structions in the letters to addressees that they must make  appointments with the SHHA staff to come into the office to  review the plans and that safety protocols contained in the  PHOs must be observed. This modified procedure will remain  in effect until PHOs change the guidance. Due to restrictions  imposed by the PHOs regarding mass gatherings, the ACC  has curtailed the twice-a-month formal meetings and, as  such, has not had a meeting as a committee since March 4. I  ask that you bear with the ACC as it endeavors to provide a  safe environment for our SHHA staff, ACC members, and the  Sandia Heights community during this time that our opera- tions are modified to reduce the dangers from this on-going  pandemic.    Coping With Dementia  By Ruth Baird Pollard, SHHA Member and Author of  “Loving Gordon: A Dementia Caregiver’s Journey”    When my husband was diagnosed with dementia in his early  60’s, we were both devastated. How could this be happening  to an otherwise very healthy man? And how could this be  happening to the husband I loved so much? We were totally  unprepared for his diagnosis, but during the six and a half  years that I was his caregiver, I learned all I could about de- mentia. Three of the most important things I learned are— Get educated. Get support. Get help.  Education. I read as many books and articles as I could get  my hands on about this disease. I attended seminars, I re- searched it on the internet, and I kept my eyes and ears open  to learn all I could. I took classes on effective caregiving.  Support. Join a support group. They are invaluable; not  only will you learn how others are coping with this disease,  you might make some new friends. Don’t wait until you are  at the end of your rope. Join early in the process.  Help. Don’t try to go it alone. Get help early and often. I  had help from family, friends, my church, and eventually pro- fessional caregivers. Let neighbors and close friends know  your loved one has dementia. Don’t be embarrassed to talk  about it. I had help from perfect strangers when I asked for  help. And sometimes I didn’t have to ask, they sensed it.  Your local Alzheimer’s Association has a wealth of infor- mation, and they will be of great help to you in finding re- sources in your community. They have classes, support  group information, lots of educational material, and here in  Albuquerque they host a large Caregiver Conference every  fall (maybe not this year). The first call I made upon learning  of his dementia was to the Alzheimer’s Association in the  town we lived near. And, maybe most importantly, take care  of yourself. For if you don’t, who will care for your loved one?  I got through this journey—you can too.    Keep Bears Wild  By Kate Fry, SHHA Member    We’ve heard several reports of bears in Sandia Heights, in- cluding a photo of a mom and cub in the neighborhood in the  middle of the day. It’s early for bears to be in our area—they  usually don’t show up until the acorns ripen—and it’s unu- sual to see them during the day. This might mean that there’s  not enough food at higher elevations, probably due to lack  of rainfall, and the bears are coming into our neighborhood  to find food. So, we need to modify our behavior to keep our  bears safe. We want to keep our dwindling population of  bears in the Sandias wild, and the only way to assure they  stay wild is by not having anything on our property that at- tracts them. If they get used to easily available “people food”  that means trouble for bears.   Here’s what you can do:  • Keep garbage in the garage or other enclosed space and  don’t put it out until the morning of trash pickup.  • Bring bird feeders inside at night or stop feeding the birds  during the time bears are active, usually April through mid- November. Birds have plenty of natural food during bear  season.  • Store pet food and bird seed inside the house or garage.   If you do see a bear, leave it alone. If there’s nothing on  your property to attract them, they won’t stick around. NM  Game and Fish has issued instructions that we should not call  them UNLESS a bear is trying to get into our house. Bears are  an important part of our ecosystem, and it would be a shame  if they disappeared from the Sandia Mountains. We live in  their habitat, after all, and it’s up to us to coexist harmoni- ously with bears and all wildlife. Only people can prevent  bear problems—please do your part to keep our bears safe!           3   The GRIT – August 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 8  Snakes and You  By Kate Fry, SHHA Member    Even in mid-summer, snakes still need to sun themselves and  forage for food. SNAKES? Sandia Heights residents have  mixed feelings about snakes—some people like them and  some people don’t. So, by speaking in defense of snakes, I  hope that folks will see snakes in a different light. Humans  seem to be hard-wired to be afraid of snakes, even if they  have never seen a snake. Living in Sandia Heights, we share  habitat with several kinds of snakes, the most common of  which are bull snakes (also called gopher snakes) and rattle- snakes. Only the rattlesnake is venomous, but all snakes are  vital to controlling the rodent population. So please, try to  see snakes as your friend. If you can’t bring yourself to like  snakes, at least leave them alone and think about how many  more mice would be trying to get into your house without  them. Understandably, you may not want a rattlesnake tak- ing up residence outside your back door. If this happens to  you, Sandia Heights Security will be happy to remove it.   Rattlesnakes and bull snakes will be the only two men- tioned in this article because bull snakes are often mistaken  for rattlesnakes. Rattlesnakes and bull snakes have similar  coloring, with black and brown markings on their backs. This  is no accident. Bull snakes try very hard to look and act like  rattlesnakes. When threatened, they may coil and raise their  heads, hiss, and rustle their tails in dry leaves to mimic a rat- tle. However, they are nonvenomous constrictors that kill  their prey by squeezing, and they pose no threat to humans  or pets. One foolproof distinction is the shape of the pupils  of the eyes. Rattlesnakes have vertical, football-shaped pu- pils and bull snakes have round pupils. But most people don’t  want to get anywhere near close enough to tell the differ- ence that way! The easiest way to tell is to look at the head:  a rattlesnake has a distinctly triangular head with pro- nounced eye ridges and a neck that is narrower than the  head, while a bull snake’s head is roughly cylindrical and the  same diameter as its neck. The other obvious difference is  the body shape. Rattlesnakes are larger in diameter relative  to their length and are fattest in the middle of the body, with  a blunt tail ending in several rattles in adult snakes. Bull  snakes are more or less the same diameter the entire length  of their body. A five-foot-long rattlesnake may be three or  four inches in diameter in the middle of its body, while a five- foot-long bull snake is probably about an inch and a half in  diameter. These photos show the differences very clearly.  Both bull snakes and rattlesnakes are shy and will try to  avoid people. They usually know you’re approaching from  the ground vibration and, given the chance, will usually crawl  away. They won’t chase you! If you see a snake, it’s probably  stretched out on the pavement or on a sunny trail catching  rays. Snakes are reptiles and the only way they can regulate  their body temperature is by moving to a warm area (like sun- warmed asphalt) to get warm and to a cool area (under a tree    or in the shade of a rock) to cool off. This affinity for stretch- ing out on warm pavement gets many snakes killed acci- dentally. Unfortunately, some drivers go out of their way to  run over snakes. Please don’t let this be you! If you see a  snake basking on the road, try to drive around it. If you en- counter a snake while walking on a trail, you can jump up and  down or stomp your feet to create vibrations that the snake  will feel. Then just wait for the snake to move away. But if a  rattlesnake responds by coiling and rattling, take a detour!  Never put your hands or feet any place you can’t see. If you  follow this advice, you won’t get bitten.  In the unlikely event you are bitten, don’t panic! Call 911  and keep the bite area lower than your heart to slow the  spread of venom. Snakebite kits are useless and may even  make things worse. Rattlesnake venom is a potent toxin that  kills nerves and tissue, so the best thing to do is to get to a  hospital as quickly as possible and get antivenin. Dogs some- times are bitten because they are curious and put their face  up to a snake to see what it is. If this happens, get the dog to  the vet as fast as you can. It’s another good reason to keep  dogs on a leash when you walk them on streets or on trails.  If you see a snake near your house, please leave it alone.  You’ll probably never see it again. Rest assured it will gobble  up mice and other rodents and keep the population under  control. There’s never a good reason to kill a snake—they are  an essential part of our wildlife habitat.

It burned vegetation in a va- cant lot that is for sale and is adjacent to three homes.  The cause of the blaze was illegal fireworks. Please,  please—do not set off your own fireworks. They may  seem like innocent fun, but there’s no such thing in our  dry, high-desert environment. Take a good look at these  photos. These are your neighbors. It could have been  you. If you see people setting off fireworks, consider  calling the Bernalillo Sheriff’s office to come shut them  down before more fires break out.

We  do not want to put the health of any participant in jeopardy. We will continue to monitor the pandemic. We are  considering several alternatives and will make our decision about the tour known at a later date. Be safe.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per  directions of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of  every other month, hopefully starting in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner  group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating  (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with  attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on  food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was  started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.

Monthly Fun Fact  By Matt Pedigo, SHHA Member    Albuquerque’s elevation varies from 4,900 feet in the Rio Grande Valley to 6,700 feet in the foothills and  has an “official” elevation of 5,312 feet. According to Yahoo! Answers, Albuquerque is the highest city  with a population over 500,000 in the U.S. Colorado Springs and Santa Fe are higher, but have city  populations below 500,000 (although C. Springs metro area is over 500,000 and the city is growing  rapidly). Denver’s elevation is, of course, 5,280 feet.
