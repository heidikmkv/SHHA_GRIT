    Safety First on Sandia Heights’ Streets!  By Emily Rudin & Matt Pedigo, Members, Parks & Safety Committee    In Sandia Heights, we have amazing opportunities for recreation right out our front  doors. But most of our streets lack sidewalks, bike lanes, and crosswalks. Herewith,  some friendly pointers to keep us all safe:  •  Drivers and cyclists, please be continuously alert for children at play whom you  might not see around the bend or impulsively crossing the street.  •  Kids and cyclists, play your music at a low enough volume to hear traffic and  warning bells behind and in front of you.  •  Sightlines need to be open. Our foothills roads twist and turn. Although Berna- lillo County is responsible for maintaining our streets and edges, homeowners  should be pro-active in keeping vegetation clear along the shoulders adjacent  to your property.   •  Our dedicated mail carriers would be most grateful if you keep plants pruned  well away from your mailbox on all sides.  •  Many of our streets have two- and four-way stop signs. No matter how familiar  you are with these intersections, Stop means STOP. Always. Every time. Make  sure your car and bicycle wheels actually stop moving before proceeding.  •  Look both ways before crossing any street. Make eye contact with drivers or  cyclists who might be turning. Some might improperly be failing to signal. Make  sure they see you.   •  Walk with others single file. Be mindful of split-second surprises that you could  encounter while conversing.  •  Lots of us walk dogs. County ordinance requires that dogs always be on leashes.  That’s especially true on trails, in arroyos, and even in our own driveways. Driv- ers and cyclists, look for dogs and their people, and courteously share the space.  •  Drivers, please keep your speed down to 20 mph or less, as posted, at all times,  and yield to non-drivers. It’s the law.

This District is open to hunting  all big-game, but is restricted to bow hunting only, and  that only during established seasons. For the 2019-2020  season, those dates were September 1–24, November  23–December 1 (youth only), and January 1–15. Ap- proved hunting dates are similar year-to-year. Legal  hunting hours are from ½ hour before sunrise to ½  hour after sunset. To report poaching, call 1-800-432- 4263 or visit  http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/enforcement/opera- tion-game-thief-overview/.    The Number of Children   Residing in Sandia Heights  By William Koup, Community Services & Membership    One of the goals of the Community Services and Mem- bership Committee (CS&M) is to develop fun and  meaningful social activities for the children and grand- children of the residents of Sandia Heights. Your com- mittee believes these activities will bring Sandia  Heights residents together to promote positive com- munity relationships and provide fun and interesting  activities for the children growing up in our wonderful  and unique neighborhood. To do this we need a rea- sonably accurate count of the number of children who  live here.  The 2019 Sandia Heights Resident’s Survey received  486 responses which provided a confidence level of  over 95%. Question number 30 asked: What is the num- ber of children and/or grandchildren by ages at your  home? From the 486 responses, we estimated that  14.4% of the respondents have children. Sandia Heights  currently has approximately 4200 residents living in  2196 households. By extrapolation, there are approxi- mately 465 children residing in Sandia Heights.  The CS&M Committee wants to more accurately de- termine the number of children and their ages. Future  surveys will provide more accurate estimates. The data  from the 2019 survey, and all future data, will be ex- tremely helpful in planning activities designed for chil- dren and their families.  What are your thoughts? Do you have any ideas for  future programs or activities for the children of our  community? If so, the CS&M Committee invites your  participation, comments and input.  Grey Water Systems  By Bob Bower, Architectural Control   Committee Chair    I recently read an article in the Home Style section of  the Albuquerque Journal written by Barry Stone, who is  a certified home inspector. It relates to a question he  received from a potential home buyer who noted that  the home he wanted to buy had a drainpipe from the  laundry room. Instead of draining into the septic sys- tem, the pipe emptied into a garden area in the back  yard. The seller noted that he has been draining his  washer this way for years and that some of his neigh- bors do likewise. Barry indicated that homeowners  with septic systems often drain grey water from their  laundry onto their property. He goes on to say that  even though the practice is prohibited by code, it is  generally regarded as a necessary trade-off to protect  the continued performance of the septic system. Laun- dry detergents and bleaches are commonly known to  have damaging effects on the ecology of septic tanks.  The friendly bacteria in the tanks are necessary for the  decomposition of solid waste matter. Laundry chemi- cals can kill these bacteria causing the septic system to  become clogged with solids that are not dissolved.  Drainage of washer effluent into landscaped areas is a  simple way to avoid such problems with the septic sys- tem, although Barry emphasized that this is not an ap- proved method.   He indicated that a legal, within-code alternative  would be to install a small leach field for the grey water  consisting of buried drainage rocks at the end of the  drainpipe. The building department at Bernalillo  County can provide specifications for this type of small  leach field. As an aside, there are many biodegradable  laundry products available that are septic-system  friendly. However, one of the points of Barry’s article is  to explain that a properly designed grey-water line and  its accompanying leach field is a viable approach to eas- ing the load on your septic system. An ideal solution  that is both friendly to the environment and to your  septic system would be to use biodegradable laundry  products and also install a grey-water line with an ap- propriate leach field.    3   The GRIT – February 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 2    Agenda for 2020 Annual Meeting    Business Meeting  I.

Re- member: you are always at a disadvantage with respect  to cars and trucks. Those on foot should stay to the far  left of the road, facing oncoming traffic. Those on wheels  hug the right shoulder, with traffic.  •  Everyone, please be both visible and predictable. For non- drivers, a reflective vest makes a huge difference any time  of day. Pick one up at the SHHA Office for just $2.  •  Never use a hand-held device to talk or text while driving.  It’s the law. Non-drivers, know that being distracted can  endanger you too—so be cautious.  Darkness poses special safety risks. In addition to the tips  listed above, walkers at night should:  •  Wear light-colored, reflective clothing (including reflec- tive arm bands or vests).  •  Use clip-on LED safety lights or similar devices.  •  Carry a flashlight and turn it on.   •  Walk in groups or with a dog for added safety.  •  Beware of roadside tripping hazards and steep slopes.  •  Stay alert! Listen for approaching vehicles. Motorists  might not be expecting pedestrians to be out at night.  In addition to the tips listed above, drivers at night should:  •  Drive slowly, below the posted speed limits.  •  Anticipate that pedestrians and bicyclists might be out at  night.  •  Use extra caution driving over hills, coming around cor- ners, and at intersections.  •  Stay alert! Do not get distracted.  •  Give pedestrians and cyclists the right of way.  Your safety is paramount to the pleasure of living in Sandia  Heights.  IS YOUR CALENDAR MARKED?

Presidents’ Day    This year we celebrate Presidents’ Day on February 17.  The U.S. holiday is the third Monday in February. Offi- cially Washington’s Birthday, it is popularly recognized  as honoring both George Washington and Abraham Lin- coln. The day is sometimes understood as a celebration  of the birthdays and lives of all U.S. presidents.  In 1885, President Chester Arthur signed a bill making  Washington’s birthday a federal holiday. In 1968, Con- gress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill, which  moved a number of federal holidays to Mondays. Dur- ing debate on the bill, it was proposed that Washing- ton’s Birthday be renamed Presidents’ Day to honor the  birthdays of both Washington (February 22) and Lincoln  (February 12). Although Lincoln’s birthday was cele- brated in many states, it was never an official federal  holiday. Following much discussion, Congress rejected  the name change. However, after the bill went into ef- fect in 1971, Presidents’ Day became the commonly ac- cepted name, due in part to retailers’ use of that name  to promote sales and also the proximity to Lincoln’s  birthday.    Reminders from Your Covenant   Support Committee    Room Rental  Big house; feeling lonely; want to meet new folks? There  are many ways to satisfy this need, but doing an Airbnb  or room rental is not one of them. It is tempting to rent  out that extra bedroom in order to make extra money.  However, your covenants do not permit this.  Short-term rentals also create concerns about main- taining security in your neighborhood. As a short-term  landlord, you are inviting transient renters into the area,  which may pose a threat to your neighbors. The Sandia  Heights Security Patrol, available by subscription, does  a great job of patrolling and looking for unfamiliar cars  in your area. But by doing short-term rentals, you make  their job much more difficult.  If you have your home listed as a daily room rental,  please immediately remove your listing. If your neigh- bor is involved in room rental, please file a covenant  complaint so that we may investigate.    Trash Cans  Trash containers visible from the street are a major  source of complaints. The trash bins should be wheeled  behind a fence or screen or put in the garage. The con- tainers may be put out on the day before collection in  the late afternoon, although it is far better to put them  out the morning of pick up because of scavenging  bears. Bins must be stored after the trash is picked up.  At some times of year, we also generate more paper  and boxes than will fit into our recycle bins. If this is your  case, consider using some of the off-site recycle bins  throughout the city (found on the BernCo web site) or  divide the load up for two pickup cycles. You can also  call Sandia Heights Services and ask what other options,  such as a special pickup, can be arranged.    Parking  Most of the covenants address cars that have not  moved from a lot or driveway in some time or are unli- censed. These may be a covenant violation which the  CSC will investigate. However, we do get complaints  about cars parked on the street or in communal parking  areas as well. The CSC does not handle these parking is- sues and they should be referred to the Sheriff’s Depart- ment. SHHA does not have the authority to enforce  parking on county roads or common areas. The Sheriff  can and will tow cars at the owner’s expense. Once  towed, it may be difficult or expensive to reclaim your  car, so be mindful of where you park.

Please note that some of the items men- tioned are no longer applicable—see end of article.)  Sandia Heights—It’s [sic] Concepts   and Development  By Ben Abruzzo  As those of us who live here recognize, Sandia Heights is a  unique place to live with qualities in life style [sic] not easily  obtainable in most areas of the country, or in fact in the  world. The concept of Sandia Heights developed almost sim- ultaneously with Sandia Peak Tramway with the first homes  in Sandia Heights original subdivision being completed  roughly a year prior to the opening of the tramway. The en- tire area was very carefully master planned and carefully re- stricted to provide the unusual and pleasant surroundings  which residents today enjoy. A great deal of planning in all  phases of the various sub-divisions occurred many years  prior to the offering of home sites in the individual units.  We are very proud of the fact that our community is es- sentially self contained providing our own water service,  solid refuse disposal system, and with the developers  providing the bulk of the roadway maintenance in the area.  Our Fire District is one of the finest volunteer districts in the  entire State of New Mexico and our response to emer- gencies in the area is indeed excellent in every respect.  At this writing there are approximately 650 resi- dences completed and another 50 under construction.  Sandia Heights Subdivisions are owned and have been  developed by a Tri Venture consisting of ownership by  Alvarado Realty Company, Sandia Peak Tram Company,  and Sandia Peak Ski Company. The Tri Venture provided  funds for the improvements in the subdivisions as well  as facilities such as the Fire District #5 Volunteer Fire Sta- tion which was constructed by the companies and sub- sequently sold to Bernalillo County. The Company also is  responsible for the improved and expanded Guard Ser- vice presently offered.  Prime in the plans for development were complete  recreational facilities immediately available to the resi- dents of Sandia Heights. The Four Seasons Club was con- structed to provede [sic] availability of swimming and  tennis couts [sic] to residents. Stables were developed  to provide riding facilities, horse rentals, boarding facili- ties for those owning horses, and planned activities such  as hay rides, steak rides, hamburger cook-out rides, and  breakfast rides. Sandia Peak Tramway opens the “back- yards” of residents to enjoyment of the entire range of  activities available in the Sandia Mountains, including ski- ing, hiking, snow shoeing, hang gliding, picnicking and  year round outdoor activity. In addition, residents are af- forded convenience to two fine restaurants. The Fire- house is located at the base of the tramway and High Fi- nance is located at the top of the mountain.  That’s the end of the historical article. So, what’s  changed? Roadway maintenance is now done by the  County. Our fire station is staffed by paid, professional  firemen, not volunteers. There are about 2200 resi- dences now, with only a couple under construction; few  vacant lots remain. The Guard Service is now called SHS  Security Patrol. The Four Seasons Club, swimming pool,  tennis courts and horse stables were closed some time  ago. The land they were on is now part of the Sandia  Pueblo. The restaurants at top and bottom of the tram  have changed names and, for the one up top, even the  structure is different. A lot has happened in 40 years!      9 The GRIT - February 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 2 10 The GRIT - February 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 2 11   The GRIT – February 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 2        Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We meet on the second Saturday of every other month,  starting in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the  year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing  to some part of the meal – along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather  than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole group dinners during the  year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in  September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome.
