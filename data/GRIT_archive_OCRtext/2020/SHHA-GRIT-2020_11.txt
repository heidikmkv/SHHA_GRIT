At this point you may be casting your eyes to the left and no- ticing quite a few names. What that list doesn’t show is that several Board  Members’ and Officers’ terms expire soon and some are term-limited out.  We hope any interested person will apply (application is on the website or  call the office). In particular, the Board could use more pre-retirees and  people with children still at home. Board meetings are on one Wednesday  evening a month so as to not conflict with most people’s work schedules.  It is also important for the Board to reflect the concerns and cultures of  the varied areas of Sandia Heights. The current Board Members live in the  following units: North 0 and 1; South 1, 8C, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 23. If you  live in an unrepresented unit, think about throwing your name in the hat  in the next month. We will interview all applicants. Successful applicants  will be voted on by the SHHA members attending the (probably virtual)  annual meeting in February 2021. But names of nominated Board Members  need to be announced 60 days prior to the meeting, so don’t procrastinate  too long.      Thank You, Tramway Adoptive Parents    A very special “thanks” goes to those residents of Sandia Heights who  chose to spend an hour or so on September 26 picking up trash, thereby  fulfilling an SHHA obligation since we have “adopted” a section of Tram- way Blvd. Social distancing and mask wearing made taking a photo diffi- cult—so we didn’t! Those donning safety vests and toting trash bags were  Roger Hagengruber, Robert Hare, Ginger Rich, Emily Rudin, Ron Vigil, and  Cheryl Wieker. We thank you! We’ll do it again in about 6 months, so if you  missed it this time, don’t despair.  2   The GRIT – November 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 11  Invasive Trees and the CSC  By Bob Thomas, CSC Chair, and Kate Fry    There is a growing awareness in Sandia Heights that trees as  they grow, proliferate, and mature, are causing a gradual loss  of our valley and mountain views, contributing to water us- age and septic system maintenance costs, and decreasing  our property values.   Our covenants limit houses to 1 or 2 stories in order to be  in harmony with surroundings and not obstruct views. Now  some Siberian elms tower over 2-story houses. There are  hundreds, soon thousands, of saplings rapidly growing to  join them. (Although the covenants specifically prohibit Chi- nese elms; all of the invasive elms in Sandia Heights are tech- nically Siberian elms.) It is prudent for us to be aware of this  condition and consider actions to control this growing threat  to our views and quality of life.        Every year, the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) re- ceives complaints from homeowners citing a neighbor’s elm  tree that has grown to 25–30 feet and is now obstructing  their views. The relevant language in most unit covenants  states, “No Chinese elms, cotton-bearing cottonwood trees  or Bermuda grass shall be maintained on any lot. No group- ing of trees shall be planted to constitute a screen.” Land- scaping projects require approval from the Architectural  Control Committee (ACC) and this language in a broad sense  forbids planting these invasive trees.   However, how does this covenant language apply to ex- isting, mature invasive trees? A typical situation is that a new  homeowner finds a 25-foot elm tree in their yard, 30–40  years old, and now a neighbor files a complaint that the tree  is blocking their views. It is important to note that the cost of  removing this large tree will be hundreds, perhaps thou- sands, of dollars. (A question that needs asking is why didn’t  the neighbor take notice when the tree was 5 feet tall, and  request removal then? This does require some insight and co- operation between neighbors.)   The word “maintain” is the focal point in this covenant  language, specifically as to its legal meaning. Does it mean  ownership or stewardship? If it means ownership, then when  a complaint is filed the fact that the tree exists on a property  renders the complaint valid. Alternatively, if it means stew- ardship, implying some measure of care and feeding, then  when a complaint is filed but the homeowner is not fertilizing  or watering the tree, the complaint would not have merit. It  is the opinion of the SHHA attorney that the word “maintain”  is subjective, that is, not sufficiently defined and subject to  interpretation, and as such it is questionable as to how the  courts would judge. Experience has shown that the cost to  SHHA to get a case before a judge is around $30,000. The  SHHA cannot gamble thousands of dollars on a court’s coin  flip for each of the hundreds, soon to be thousands, of these  trees. Therefore, the CSC will not enforce removal of mature  invasive trees.  The CSC encourages neighbors to work together to find a  satisfactory resolution to the invasive tree problem. A good  starting point is to destroy early on the saplings. This involves  communication between neighbors and possibly sharing  costs to remove a large tree. An intermediate solution with  potentially lower costs may be to significantly trim the tree.  The CSC can, if asked, act as a facilitator to this end.    Sandia Clouds  By Ruth Baird Pollard, SHHA member    On any given day, the view from my living room window is  fantastic. My windows look out on the magnificent Sandia  Mountains with a direct view of Sandia Peak. On sunny days  I can see the sun shining on the tram cables and tram cars  that ascend over 4,000 feet from the altitude of my house to  the peak. The view of the mountain constantly changes de- pending on the weather or the time of day. Many days at sun- set, they turn a lovely shade of pink. The Spanish called them  the Watermelon Mountains, but The Tiwa Pueblo name for  Sandia Mountains is posu gai hoo-oo or “where water slides  down arroyo.” Since I hadn’t lived near a mountain before I  moved to Albuquerque about eight years ago, I thought  mountain views would be pretty static. I didn’t think they  would change much from hour to hour and day to day. I was  wrong!  I once witnessed a most unusual and beautiful cloud for- mation. A long bank of clouds moved quickly under a larger  formation of clouds, like a slithering giant eel. Other fluffy  clouds formed underneath the eel-like cloud, with long, spiky  tendrils, like bony hands, reaching down to another smaller  group of clouds. From this smaller group, more long spiky  tendrils were reaching up to the fluffy clouds as if they  wanted to be rescued from extinction. The wind was gently  blowing the tendrils back and forth and these tendrils were  being taken up into the larger cloud, like a resurrection of  wraiths. I watched this fantastic cloud ballet for at least fif- teen minutes. It was like nothing I had ever seen before.      3   The GRIT – November 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 11    Security Camera Considerations  By Joe Boyce, SHHA Board Member    Security is near the top of the list of SHHA residents’ concerns.  To determine if security cameras at neighborhood entry points  would help improve our community’s security, a sub-group of  SHHA Board members recently evaluated options and issues  and provided a recommendation to the Board. After detailed re- view, we concluded that encouraging individual homeowners  to install security cameras is the best approach. Below is a sum- mary of our findings. Please also note many previous articles in  The GRIT about improving security, showing the importance of  neighborhood watch and basic home-security measures.  Do community gates help improve security? Surprisingly,  there is no clear evidence that community gates improve secu- rity much, despite their significant costs, support requirements,  and “hassle factor.” This was not further considered.  Do cameras help improve security? Yes, cameras work for  both prevention and prosecution/recovery. Much research  shows that well-placed security camera systems (with signs)  measurably reduce crime. And, video or still-imagery helps after  a crime, especially if it shows clear license plate numbers.   How much are we willing to spend? It depends. With 18 en- trances to SHHA (8 on the east side of Tramway, 10 on the  west), it is expensive to cover every entrance, even with low  cost cameras. If we add in providing power (solar panels or bat- teries), control and storage of images, and maintenance, the  costs can be thousands of dollars per entry. Commercial sys- tems can cost $2400/camera/year. One system would provide li- cense-plate reading, installation including solar, and networked  monitoring at an annual cost of about $43,000–not including  SHHA support time or other costs.  Where would cameras be located? They must be placed in  safe, supportable, functional loca- tions near entry points, and with  adequate power and protection  against weather and vandalism.  They need good lighting and net- work connectivity or access for  storage retrieval. Each entry would  likely require a new pole with a  raised camera and solar panel. Lo- cal ordinances/regulations need to  be considered, along with liability  and public and private legal issues.  How would we monitor? Having  a full-time person for monitoring  the cameras is not feasible. Real- time monitoring by a security ser- vice is expensive. Local image stor- age requires staffing to manually  retrieve images, verify the systems  are working, and change batteries.  Access to images would need to be  carefully controlled for security and  privacy reasons.  License plate reading (LPR) capa- bility. Even with this capability,  some criminals steal tags or cars. While LPR is one of the most  useful and admissible pieces of evidence, it requires significant  effort to filter out criminals from temporary workers and that  can only be done by local law enforcement. Basic camera sys- tems don’t have high enough resolution to read license plates  reliably. Glare and lighting are challenges, and the privacy of res- idents and their guests will always be a concern.  Cost and value. It would require a significant increase in asso- ciation fees to provide this capability, and not all residents even  now join our neighborhood association. Would SHHA-placed  cameras improve the monitoring over current residents’ sys- tems enough to be worth thousands of dollars? Would we use  LPR or real-time monitoring to respond to crimes effectively?  Will the community support it? Although homeowners have a  clear right to protect and monitor their property, community- owned systems incur privacy concerns: Who can see the im- ages? How are they stored, and how long? Why aren’t non-SHHA  members paying their share? The Board doubts there would be  broad enough support to finance and implement such a system.  Given these findings, the Board does not support installing  SHHA-owned or supported entry camera systems at this time.  Instead, our team recommends we continue to rely on private  systems and encourage residents to install their own security  camera systems, especially those who live near entrances to the  neighborhood. SHHA might be able to help with recommenda- tions or specifications for best-value systems and camera place- ment. We might also install “Smile, you are on camera” or equiv- alent signs at entrances to get the message to would-be crimi- nals and possibly deliver much of the intended prevention.   We hope this information helps you understand the issues  and considerations for this complex topic. We’ve provided a de- cision tree to show how we came to these conclusions.

Here’s the second part  of the real story.  Flight 260 was underway right on time. As it began its  course to the north on its climb to 9000 feet, it passed over  Wyoming Boulevard, and a young man standing there with  his Air Force officer father looked up at the plane as it disap- peared into the clouds on a northeast heading. He was the  last person to see Skyliner Binghamton intact.  The folks waiting for the deplaning passengers in Santa Fe  at 7:25 that Saturday morning began to realize by 7:45 that  something was amiss. Air traffic controllers in Albuquerque  were as well as there were no responses from the cockpit to  any of the calls for “TWA 2-6-0 please give us your location.”  By 9:00, airline authorities and aviation officials knew a crisis  was at hand. By 10 AM search and rescue teams were being  assembled and deployed.  The Sunday morning Albuquerque Journal banner head- line read, “Air Liner Search Continues: 16 Aboard TWA Plane  Feared Down in Wild Country North of Here.” The story ex- plained a search had begun the previous morning. Hundreds  of calls from all over northern New Mexico were reporting an  aircraft, an explosion, a low-flying plane, but to no avail.  That morning, January 20, Jim Bixler, chief pilot for Carco  Air  Service  had a hunch  as he flew  north  from  the airport en  route to Los  Alamos.  He  made  a  northeast  swing toward  the western  edge of the  Sandia Moun- tains and there, atop a pinnacle known later as the “Dragon’s  Tooth,” he spotted the empennage—tail assembly—of Sky- liner Binghamton hanging precipitously over the eastern  edge. When he radioed this information in, all the search and  rescue efforts refocused to this single spot in the Sandias.  What had been a search and rescue effort became a recovery  of the 16 bodies from the crash site. Crews from Sandia Base  and volunteers from New Mexico Mountain Club made the  arduous climb down from the Kiwanis Cabin to the Dragon’s  Tooth to begin the painful process of transporting 16 body  bags down to waiting ambulances.  The 45,000-pound aircraft traveling 230 mph exploded  and burned on impact. Most of the aluminum wreckage and  both engines were scattered across the top of the pinnacle.  Debris had been thrown completely over the pinnacle and  landed in the can- yon west of the  Dragon’s  Tooth,  while about one  third of the debris  had fallen into the  eastern  canyon  immediately  be- low  the  pinna- cle—now known  as TWA Canyon.  The tail section  was the largest in- tact piece.   On March 24 and 25 of 1955 the Civil Aeronautics Board  (CAB) conducted a series of hearings in Albuquerque to de- termine what had happened that led TWA 260 to its fateful  and fatal collision with the Sandia Mountains. CAB investiga- tor Philip Goldstein had been to the site multiple times. He  reported that the recovered instruments were too severely  damaged to provide any meaningful data. At this time, there  were no flight-data recorders on commercial aircraft, so no  “black box” could be recovered to aid in determining what  had precipitated the accident   Goldstein did report one very interesting anomaly, how- ever: it was  clear  from  the position  of the em- pennage and  the  debris  that  the  plane  was  heading  al- most directly  back toward  the airport— a southwest  heading away from the mountain—as it impacted the east  side of the pinnacle, not the west. It was flying away from  the mountains, not into the mountains. What was never  brought to the attention of the CAB panel were the detailed  weather conditions in the immediate area of the mountain  that morning nor, surprisingly, was testimony solicited from  two other TWA Constellation pilots who had been discussing  weather conditions with Spong and Creason before takeoff  that Saturday.  So, what had led TWA 260 approximately 10 miles off  course and into the face of a granite pinnacle?

By Bob Bower, ACC Chair     We may have a mild winter this year, but who knows? It’s  always helpful this time of the year to remind you of ways  to protect your water pipes from the effects of very cold  weather. Most of the local experts on this subject generally  agree that steps need to be taken to protect water pipes if  temperatures are expected to drop below 21 degrees Fahr- enheit. A broken water pipe inside your home can cause a  lot of extensive and expensive damage!  Let’s start with the outside of your home. Disconnecting  water hoses and protecting outdoor water faucets are very  important. Water that freezes in outdoor hoses connected  to faucets causes a buildup of pressure on interior plumbing  that can result in a rupture of the interior pipes if the pres- sure is too high. Damage to these interior pipes near an out- door water faucet is often difficult to repair due to the inac- cessibility of these pipes. Disconnecting hoses from outdoor  faucets and protecting the faucets with hard-foam insulat- ing cups are good ways to reduce the chances of damage to  these water pipes that extend through your exterior walls.  These inexpensive foam cups can be purchased at home im- provement or hardware stores and are easy to install. I’ve  also found that it is wise to wrap outdoor faucets with some  insulation prior to placing the foam cup over the faucets,  particularly if any of the faucets are located on the north  side of your home or are located in an area that does not  receive any winter sun. Also, if you have any water pipes  that are located outside your home that are exposed to the  outside temperatures, you should consider using insulating  tubes or heat tape around these exposed pipes.   Now, let’s consider the inside of your home. If Albuquer- que experiences a spell of extremely cold weather where  temperatures, particularly at night, drop below the 21°F  “benchmark,” leave the water supply line on at a very slow  drip rate somewhere inside your home. Water in slow mo- tion in a pipe is much less likely to freeze than water that is  motionless. A faucet located far away from where the water  enters your home is the one that you should use for this pur- pose. The cost of water used is insignificant compared to  the cost of repairing damage caused by a broken water line  inside your home. Normally, these very cold spells don’t last  long so leaving an indoor faucet dripping for a few days and  nights should get you through these spells until warmer  temperatures return. If you are away from your home dur- ing the cold season, make sure that there is adequate heat  inside your home to prevent internal pipes from freezing.  Even when trying to save energy costs, don’t turn the heat  too far down (experts recommend no lower than 55°F) and  don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you have all of the  water lines properly drained. Believe me, I have seen the  damage caused by pipes that have not been properly  drained and have subsequently burst inside a home where  the heat had been turned off. It’s not a pretty sight!  One final note for those of you who have swamp coolers.  If you have not already done so, be sure to drain the water  reservoir and disconnect and drain the water supply line. It  doesn’t take much of a freeze to damage these cooler com- ponents. And don’t forget to wrap or cup any swamp cooler  faucets.   Have a great winter!!

When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of  every other month, hopefully starting sometime next year, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small  dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating  (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with  attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on  food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was  started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome.

Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    Monthly Fun Fact  By Matt Pedigo, SHHA Member    Albuquerque historically received most of its water from underground water tables, some of which are  over a mile deep. These aquifers are recharged by runoff from the mountains north and east of town.  Ground water now makes up only about 40% of the city’s water. A second water source is the San Juan  Chama Project, which involves a series of tributaries that form the Colorado, San Juan and Chama rivers.  Additional water is taken from the Rio Grande River. Sandia Heights’ water comes from wells drilled at  the base of the Sandia Mountains. These wells only provide water for our community. You can see the  water storage tanks just uphill from the tram house.    Correction    The September GRIT contained an article entitled “Legal Bow Hunting in Cibola.” The article cited a rule  of NM Department of Game and Fish: “It is unlawful to discharge a firearm within 150 yards of a dwelling  or building without the permission of the owner or lessee. Bows are considered a firearm.”  An alert resident of Sandia Heights accurately pointed out that technically, a bow is not a firearm. In  order to minimize the risk of misleading someone or creating confusion, a correction is appropriate.  Technically, bows are not firearms; however, using a bow for hunting game is subject to the same rules  of hunting as are firearms.    Free Gardening Webinar Series  by Elizabeth Edgren  NMSU’s Cooperative Extension Service is offering a great free webinar series that I tried out recently. It’s  called “Ready, Set, GROW!” and covers a variety of topics related to home gardening, both vegetable  and landscape gardening. I attended one on Pollinator Habitat for the Fall/Winter Garden and was  inspired to make or protect homes for the pollinators in our area. The presenters are experts in their  fields and usually give opportunity for Q&A time at the end of their presentation.   Webinars will continue on 1st and 3rd Wednesdays at 3:00 PM through March 2021. It’s easy to sign up,  and even if you can’t watch the Zoom webinar “live,” if you do sign up, you can later access the slides  and information presented.
