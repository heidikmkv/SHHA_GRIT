In late December, the office moved from its location of 20+ years to  the Sandia Heights Village shopping center (formerly Quail Run Center) in  Suite 4. That was a temporary space while the new space in Suite 3 was being  finished for us. That work was completed and all inspections passed in mid- April. The move next door to Suite 3 happened the week of April 13. It took a  little longer than the move into Suite 4 did in order to comply with appropri- ate social distancing guidelines.  The office remains closed through April 30 or whatever later date Gov.  Lujan Grisham may set for non-essential businesses to reopen. You can still  conduct business with SHHA via email.    Coronavirus News    We are not in a situation that SHHA, or most anyone else, ever expected or  planned for. The Governor’s stay-at-home order extends through at least  April 30 (at the time of writing), and probably no one would be surprised if it  went longer. We are instructed to stay at home except for emergency or es- sential outings. Non-essential businesses, which includes the SHHA office,  must close in-person operations. When you do go out, the CDC (Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention) recommends wearing a cloth face covering  in public where it is difficult to maintain appropriate social distancing.  Several of our neighborhood food and beverage businesses remain open  for pick-up or delivery. This is a very hard time for them, too—sending a little  business their way helps.  Yes, it’s a trying time, as our neighbors at La Vida Llena so unfortunately  learned first-hand. We feel for them. If we all do what is asked, maybe New  Mexico’s hospitals and ICUs won’t be overrun. Then if we need emergency  care, whether or not Covid-related, it will be available. If you get a chance,  thank a medical worker for being on the front lines fighting this war for us.    STAY HOME              It could save  lives  2   The GRIT – May 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 5  PNM Substation  By Robert Hare, Architectural Control   Committee Member    On February 11th, PNM (our electricity provider) an- nounced its decision to build a new substation on a four- acre site on the southwest corner of Paseo del Norte  and Browning NE. The substation will serve our Sandia  Heights residents as well as others nearby. PNM plans  to begin construction late this year with an operational  date of mid-2021.  PNM has indicated that additional meetings will oc- cur in the near future to discuss decisions for site de- sign, including enclosure walls, transmission lines and  poles, and landscaping once the site is completed. PNM  has indicated that an open house (location and date to  be determined) will occur prior to submission of the de- sign package to Bernalillo County. PNM must obtain a  special-use permit from the county prior to construc- tion of the substation.  North Albuquerque Acres Community Association  and residents oppose the project. They are concerned  about the large towers to be constructed along Eubank  and Paseo Del Norte and the impact the substation and  towers will have on the views and home values of the  residences near the substation. NAACA has stated that  the planned site violates the long-established sector  plan and protections within it. A lawsuit by the residents  is possible and could delay the project.  The ACC will provide updates on this PNM project as  we learn them.    A Brief History of the Elena Gallegos  Land Grant  By Keith Julian, SHHA member    In 1695, Don Diego De Vargas, the governor of Nuevo  Mexico, awarded to a Spanish colonial-militia captain  named Don Diego Montoya a large grant of unpopu- lated land located at the western base of the Sandia  Mountains. This was compensation for Montoya’s ser- vices in helping to reclaim “Spanish lands” from the  Pueblo peoples during the reconquest of New Mexico  (1692–1694), which followed the Pueblo Revolt of 1680.  The land grant included more than 50,000 acres, span- ning roughly 20 miles from the crest of the Sandia  Mountains westward to the Rio Grande and from what  is now Comanche Road northward 10 miles to the south- ern boundary of the Sandia Pueblo—an area  encompassing most of present-day North Valley, North- east Albuquerque, and the foothill suburbs.  During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, a young girl named  Elena Gallegos and her family fled what would later be- come Albuquerque for the safety of El Paso. Following  the reconquest, the Gallegos family returned to the Al- buquerque area in the 1690s. In 1699, at the age of 19,  Elena married a young, French-born and newly-arrived  settler of Spanish New Mexico named Jacques Gurule.    (Side note: Gurule had come to New Mexico via ironic  circumstances. He was one of only two survivors of the ill- fated 1685 LaSalle Expedition to explore the Mississippi  River and attempt to establish colonies in French-claimed  territory in the New World—thus blocking further Span- ish and English exploration and settlement of the interior  of the continent. Never coming close to the elusive Missis- sippi River, LaSalle had become ship-wrecked and blun- dered onto what is now the Texas coast south of Galves- ton. LaSalle was eventually murdered by his own men,  who, in turn, were killed by local Indians. The natives  spared only young Jacques and a fellow cabin boy. News  of the two boys’ fate reached Mexico, and they were  eventually rescued by a Spanish Franciscan expedition to  Texas to find the lost cabin boys. The Spanish Viceroy de- clined to repatriate the boys to France for fear that this  would give further support to French claims on lands sur- rounding the Gulf of Mexico, so Jacques elected to join Di- ego De Vargas in the reconquest of “Nuevo Mexico.” He  eventually settled in Bernalillo, where he married Elena  Gallegos in 1699.)  Sometime after returning to New Mexico, Elena  Gallegos-Gurule and her family developed an acquaint- ance with Don Diego Montoya, who was their neighbor  and was distantly related by marriage. A few years later,  Jacques died, leaving Elena a widow with a young son.  There are no documentary records about their relation- ship, but something apparently happened to provide in- centive for Don Diego to leave Elena title to 35,084  acres of his land grant when he died in 1712. In that era,  it was remarkable that such a vast tract of land was left  to an unrelated woman while male heirs were still alive  (Diego Montoya had five grown sons and daughters as  potential heirs). This statement of his devotion to Elena,  despite the existence of Diego's five living children, al- lowed the major portion of the grant to pass into the  young widow’s possession, thus attaching her maiden  name to the land.    Continued on page 3…  3   The GRIT – May 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 5  …continued from page 2    Elena owned and lived on this extensive tract of high- desert grasslands until her death sometime around 1731,  when the land passed to her descendants in the Gurule  family. The land grant was officially known as the Elena  Gallegos Land Grant, recognized thereafter by both  Spanish and Mexican governments, and eventually by  the American territorial government in accordance with  the provisions of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  After a lengthy legal battle, the U.S. Court of Private  Land Claims reaffirmed the property as the “Elena  Gallegos Land Grant” in 1892, following the recommen- dation made in 1889 by New Mexico’s Surveyor General,  George Washington Julian.  As decades passed, unpaid debts accumulated to  Elena Gallegos’ descendants, and during the 1920’s the  land was lost when they couldn't afford payment of  property taxes. By offering to pay overdue back-taxes  to the state and county, most of the 35,000-acre land  grant came into the hands of a New Mexico real estate  and development company, the Mutual Land Invest- ment Agency, which sold off most of the land to private  investors, speculators, and ranchers during the 1920’s  and 1930’s.  In 1937, Albert G. Simms purchased for $39,720 the  18,495 acres comprising the eastern half of the original  land grant for a cattle and sheep operation. Albert  Simms, in addition to being a wealthy New Mexico  banker, investor, rancher, and former Congressman,  was dedicated to improving the quality of education  available to young men in the Southwest. Having no  heirs, in 1960 Simms donated his 18,000+ acre share of  the Elena Gallegos Land Grant to the Albuquerque Acad- emy for Boys, an independent secondary school  founded in 1955—and to which he was an early, gener- ous benefactor.  By the late 1960’s, Ben Abruzzo and Robert Nordhaus  had purchased approximately 1600 acres of the remain- ing private land to create Sandia Heights, a rural residen- tial development at the base of their recently completed  Sandia Tramway. Although today Sandia Heights has  more than 2200 households, it retains much of its natu- ral character through adopting and enforcing strict de- velopment covenants.  In 1977, the City of Albuquerque purchased 7,640  acres of the Elena Gallegos Grant from Albuquerque  Academy (which had changed its name after becoming  a coeducational institution in 1976). The City then en- tered into a land exchange with the U.S. Forest Service  (USFS), which manages much of the original eastern  portion of the land grant as part of the 37,877-acre San- dia Wilderness, as designated by Congress in 1978. In  1981–82, USFS lands in the Cibola National Forest were  exchanged for surplus Federal lands in the Sandia foot- hills and given to City of Albuquerque, which established  an Open Space Division to manage a new semi-wilder- ness park, as well as to create an open-space buffer  from encroaching urban development on the city's east- ern margins at the base of the Sandia Mountains. Albu- querque Academy retained ownership of 284 acres  within the wilderness boundaries as an “educational  easement,” which has been designated as the Bear Can- yon Outdoor Campus and is used as a field site for its  science and experiential education programs.   The 640-acre Elena Gallegos Picnic Area (which is in- cluded within the City of Albuquerque’s Albert G. Simms  Park) was created in 1984. The city sold surplus parcels  of nearby land and kept proceeds in a permanent fund.  Albuquerque’s Open Space Division operates, in part,  off interest earned by this fund. In the late 1990’s, Albu- querque Academy developed approximately 1000 acres  of their remaining land grant holding as high-end resi- dential properties—now known as High Desert.  Today, Elena Gallegos’ former lands offer the same  view of rugged mountains, forested slopes, and pinon- juniper foothills that Diego Montoya held 325 years ago.  The high-desert plant community of grama grass, piñon  pine, one-seed juniper, cane cholla, and prickly-pear cac- tus hosts surprisingly large wildlife populations of mule  deer, bobcat, coyote, bear, quail, rabbits, hawks, and  jays—and are little changed from Elena Gallegos' time.  The area also provides easy access to the wilderness of  the Sandia Mountains, located only a few miles from a  metropolitan population of 900,000 residents. The  combined 45,000 acres of Wilderness and Open Space  are currently the largest such contiguous land-use hold- ings in the United States that are located in immediate  proximity to a major metropolitan area.

Letters to the Editor—Policies  By Susan McCasland, GRIT Editor    The GRIT welcomes and encourages members of the  SHHA to submit “Letters to the Editor” of not more  than 400 words. This is your opportunity to be heard  by the entire community. Topics should be of interest  or importance to the Sandia Heights community. Sub- mit your letters to the SHHA office by email, postal  mail, or in person. Letters received by the 10th of the  month will be printed in the next month’s GRIT, space  permitting. Submissions in electronic form (email text  or MS Word document) are preferred, but legible  printed or typed letters are acceptable. Authors must  identify themselves and provide a phone number or  email address for verification of authorship and per- mission to publish. The GRIT will not publish anony- mous letters and will publish the name of the letter’s  author. A brief review of the major policies follows.  The complete policy statement is available at the  SHHA office during office hours.  • Letters are subject to space limitations. Letters  not published because of space limitations will re- ceive preference for publication in the next  month’s issue if the topic is still timely and rele- vant.  • Letters will be edited for minor spelling, typo- graphical and grammatical errors. If a letter re- quires major revision before it can be accepted for  publication, it will be returned to the author with  comments on revisions required.  • Good manners and common courtesy must be ob- served in all submissions. Letters with vulgarity,  racial slurs, insulting terms, accusations, and libel- ous or potentially libelous content will be re- jected.  • Criticism of the SHHA or items published in the  GRIT is acceptable so long as the criticism is con- structive, not mean-spirited, and does not person- ally attack anyone.  • Letter writers may have no more than one letter  published per issue and precedence will be given  to less-frequent letter writers if space limitations  prevent publishing all letters submitted for a  given issue to encourage participation by the en- tire community.  • Final decision on publishing or not publishing any  letter rests with the GRIT editor.  9 The GRIT - May 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 5 10 The GRIT - May 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 5 11   The GRIT – May 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 5    Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per directions of the  Governor’s Office.  When the situation resolves we will again meet on the second Saturday of every other month, hopefully  starting in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including  the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides  the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there  are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner  group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
