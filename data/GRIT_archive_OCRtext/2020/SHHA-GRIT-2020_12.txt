But some- times nature is a little too close, as when mice move into  our homes. In addition to the obvious problems of get- ting into food and the potential for spreading disease,  mice can do really serious damage to structures. A few  years ago right here in Sandia Heights, a mouse chewing  on an electrical cord caused a fire that destroyed a  home.  Here are some thoughts on keeping mice at bay.   Control by predators. A lower mouse population is  obviously a way to decrease the number wanting to  move in with us. We have several mouse predators here  in Sandia Heights: coyotes, road runners, snakes, owls  and other birds of prey, and bobcats in particular. Keep- ing the predator population healthy is a first line of de- fense. To that end, do not poison rodents whether the  poison is indoors or outdoors. A poisoned mouse when  eaten can sicken or kill the predator. Also, do not kill  snakes or other rodent predators. Understandably, you  may not want rattlesnakes in your yard. They can be re- moved and continue to eat mice further away from you.  Sandia Heights Security can help with this. Bullsnakes,  plentiful in Sandia Heights, are harmless to humans and  pets and are fairly prodigious mouse consumers. One  study estimated that an adult male bullsnake can de- vour 1,000 field mice in a single season.  Control indoors. Mice move in with us in search of  shelter and food. Good sanitation is a way to reduce in- door mice. Store foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers,  such as metal containers, glass bottles, and heavy plas- tic containers with tight-fitting lids. Rodents easily chew  through paper boxes, plastic bags, and cellophane  packages. Waste and garbage also should be disposed  in tightly covered metal cans. Keep all pet food cleaned  up after each feeding and store feed in a metal con- tainer so it is unavailable to rodents.  Mice can enter our home through very small open- ings—roughly the size of your pinky fingertip. All open- ings rodents can enter should be covered with rodent- resistant materials, such as 1/4-inch hardware cloth. For  irregular openings such as around pipes, stuff the open- ing densely with steel wool. Mice can climb downspouts  to get on your roof and find openings there. Cover ei- ther the top or bottom of the downspout with hard- ware cloth, and be sure to remove leaf litter regularly so  your downspout isn’t blocked.  There are several things that seem to repel mice. A  couple of these that don’t also repel humans are  Bounce dryer sheets and peppermint extract.   The standard wooden snap trap is an effective way  to kill indoor mice. Set snap traps along travel routes  where you see rodent signs, such as droppings. Snap  traps should be set at right angles to the wall and such  that the rodent, in following its natural course, will pass  directly over the trigger. To make the trap more effec- tive, attach a 2-by-2 inch piece of cardboard to the trig- ger. Peanut butter, oats, chocolate, and bacon are good  baits. Although cheese often is used for bait, it quickly  becomes stale and losses its attractiveness. All baits  should be fresh and changed daily. Be sure to place  traps where pets and children will not be able to get into  them. If you have any empathy for the mice, avoid the  sticky traps. The mice break most of the bones in their  bodies trying to escape.  If you know of other ways to control mice, let us  know. We’ll publish an update in the spring.              3   The GRIT – December 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 12  Into the Clouds, Part 3  The Short, Tragic Flight of TWA 260 : Crash Determination  By Hugh Prather, SHHA Member    Less than 2 miles due east of the Sandia Heights boundary with  the Sandia Wilderness, but 4 steep, uphill miles by trail from  the tram terminal, a hiker encounters the debris field of the  tragic TWA accident that took the lives of 16 people and  spawned a series of myths and legends. Here’s the third and  final part of the real story.  What had led TWA 260 approximately 10 miles off course  and into the face of a granite pinnacle?   In October 1955 the CAB issued its determination: Capt  Ivan Spong had made an intentional variation from the pre- scribed flight route resulting in the crash. The word “inten- tional” was a damning indictment and left the TWA pilot  community shaken. Crank calls, angry letters, and veiled  threats assaulted both the Spong and Creason families. As  the invectives piled up, a veteran TWA Captain, who had  years of experience both as a World War II veteran pilot and  thousands of hours flying the Martin 404, stepped in to cor- rect this injustice.  Captain Larry DeCelles, whose father had also been a pilot  with an initial license signed by Orville Wright (!), believed  that the real answer to the tragedy lay in one of two very dif- ferent directions. In an experience several months prior, De- Celles had been flying a Martin 404 en route to Dayton and  was using an instrument approach in the clouds. As he  neared the airport and cleared the cloud cover, he discov- ered that the compass reading from one of two fluxgate  compasses in the tip of the left wing was sending an errone- ous message. Unfortunately, a design flaw allowed that erro- neous message to present on instruments in front of the Cap- tain’s instrument panel, while the correct data from the  other fluxgate compass was being delivered to an obscure  instrument to the lower right on the First Officer’s instru- ments. (A very early version of the same type of problem that  the airflow indicators on the Boeing 737 MAX would create  some 60 years later.)  The other alternative that DeCelles was confronted with  was the challenge the flight crew of TWA 260 was facing as  they were flying the “back course” of the instrument landing  system (ILS) from the Albuquerque airport during the first  leg of their flight to Santa Fe. Briefly, the ILS generated a ra- dio beam that an incoming aircraft would acquire and the  beam would signal on instruments in the cockpit whether an  adjustment to the left or to the right of the flight path was  needed to line up with the runway. The problem with flying  the “back course” was that the pilot had to think in reverse:  if the instrument said make a left adjustment the pilot  needed to make an adjustment to the right and vice versa.  Although this was part of the training all pilots underwent it  was not a common procedure.  Armed with these alternative scenarios Captain DeCelles,  who was now officially the TWA safety officer and was  representing the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), along with  his team met with CAB officials in 1957 and presented the  findings. After reviewing the additional data, the CAB did  modify the finding by deleting the word “intentional” but the  judgment related to Spong was still no less harsh.  DeCelles went back to the drawing board with his team  and added weather data and testimony from multiple other  pilots who had flown with Spong regarding his competence.  This three-year undertaking culminated with a virtually un- heard of second hearing in which the CAB completely re- versed both their initial and subsequent findings and deter- mined on June 15, 1960, that the tragedy was caused by “de- viation from the prescribed flight path for reasons un- known.”  We will never know those reasons—in those last tragic  seconds as Spong and Creason turned their aircraft away  from the mountain in a valiant but fruitless attempt to save  the lives of all on board, the reasons that led them into that  canyon died with them. Had they started that turn to the left  back toward the airport two seconds earlier or had they been  flying even 200 feet higher they would have cleared the  Dragon’s Tooth.  On February 19, 2005—50 years to the day—a solitary  hiker carried a descanso to the site and mounted it on the  largest piece of wreckage as the trail enters the debris field.  The descanso provides its readers a picture of the aircraft and  a brief description of the accident along with the names of  the 13 passengers and the three crew members aboard TWA  260 that fateful morning. It closes with the observation “May  they rest in Peace—Please respect the sanctity of this site.”      The author of this article, Hugh Prather, would like to  hear from those who would like a more in-depth  presentation. If there is sufficient interest, he will set  up a remote lecture and discussion session.

The ACC occasionally receives  applications where a resident wants to install solar col- lectors or metal roof materials on these sloped sur- faces. Either of these on a sloped roof have the capabil- ity to reflect nuisance levels of sunlight onto nearby  properties.  Let’s start with a discussion of roof-mounted solar  collectors. These collectors consist of a wide range of  devices designed to capture and convert solar radiation  into heated gasses or liquids, or to produce electrical  power. It is rare that the ACC receives an application for  solar collectors other than those used for production of  electrical energy—the photovoltaic or “PV” systems.  All types of solar collectors are mounted to the roof,  whether flat or sloped, using some sort of supporting  framework. The ACC Design Guideline for Solar Collectors  is available to all residents who want to install solar col- lectors. The Guideline specifically mentions that solar  collectors should be mounted so as to not produce ob- jectionable light reflections onto neighboring proper- ties at any time during the year. In its approval letters  for installation of solar collectors, the ACC includes a dis- claimer that places the responsibility on the resident  and the contractor for resolving any glare issues stem- ming from complaints by nearby property owners.  The use of metal materials on sloped roof surfaces  can have a glare effect similar to that of solar collectors.  In the ACC Design Guideline for Roofing, there are discus- sions of roof colors and surface finishes and how these  features affect reflectivity. Gloss is a measure of the de- gree to which a surface functions as a mirror. A high- gloss finish has the potential to reflect nuisance levels  of light onto nearby properties. The Guideline indicates  that flat and “eggshell” finishes, or “low-sheen” fin- ishes have low gloss characteristics and, as such, are ac- ceptable for use. The ACC has learned that even though  metal roofing materials are rated as “low reflectivity,”  the tests that manufacturers use are not what are  needed to predict where reflected light will appear. The  reflectivity is measured “straight on” to the surface and  does not account for the fact that the material will have  a contour that produces reflections in many directions  at once, as well as from the roof angles themselves. Bot- tom line: any smooth surface acts as a good mirror at  any angle. Again, as with the solar collectors, the ACC,  in its approval letters for metal roof installations, will  place the onus on the resident and contractor to resolve  glare issues should they arise from the installation of  the roof material.    Why are people worried about my roof choice?  The material and finish of the roof affects how it  reflects sunlight. A badly chosen roof can produce  annoying beams in unexpected directions. Nearby  neighbors, or even observers at a long distance may  be subjected to unacceptable glare.  But the material is rated as low reflectivity!  The tests that manufacturers use is not what you  need to predict where beams will show up. The  reflectivity is measured “straight on” to the surface.  But the roof material will have a contour that  produces reflections in many directions at once, as  well as the roof angles themselves.  Also, surprisingly, the surface color is not very  important to the reflections, only the surface gloss.  Any very smooth surface acts as a good mirror at  low angles. (Rather like a flat stone skipping off  water.)  So, it is to everyone’s benefit that the permitted  choices of roof materials be carefully monitored  8   The GRIT – December 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 12    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  23 Cedar Hill Road – Replace Balcony  29 Rock Ridge Drive – Replace Furnace and Swamp  Coolers with Refrigerated Air Units  29 Rock Ridge Drive – Replace Garage Door, Installation  of Gutter and Rain Barrels, and Replace Windows  71 Pinon Hill Place – Canale and Stucco Repair   109 Whitetail Drive – Remove Asphalt Driveway, Coyote  Fence, Courtyard Wall, Gate, And Ramada Installations,  and Landscaping  165 Juniper Hill Road – Silicone Coat Metal Roof  177 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Concrete Driveway  and Walkway  190 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Wood and Wrought  Iron Fencing with Retaining Wall  311 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  412 Live Oak Loop – Parapet and Stucco Repair  425 Live Oak Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  430 Live Oak Lane – Re-roof Pitched Roof and Drip Edge  Installation  455 Live Oak Road – Storage Unit Installation  539 Black Bear Road – Re-stucco House and Walls  637 Cougar Loop – New Construction  646 Cougar Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  649 Cougar Loop – Repaint House Trim and Add Semi- Circle Driveway to Existing Driveway  673 Bluebird Lane – Natural Gas Heater Installation  720-21 Tramway Lane – Cement Front Courtyard Area  804 Tramway Lane – Replace Wooden Fence  806 Tramway Lane - Reroof  905 Tramway Lane – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  1002 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   1017 Tramway Lane – Stucco Security Mailbox  1018 Tramway Lane – Stucco Security Mailbox  1041 Red Oaks Loop – Installation of a Tesla Battery for  Backup Power to the House  1134 Marigold Drive – Repave Existing Driveway with As- phalt  1134 Marigold Drive – Fence Replacement  1169 Laurel Loop – Re-stucco Backyard Wall  1169 Laurel Loop – Replace Concrete Driveway  1429 San Rafael Avenue – Replace Gates  1553 Eagle Ridge Lane – Replace AC/Heat Pump  1606 Quailwood Drive – Replace Garage Door  1806 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Windows  1862 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Windows  1903 Quail Run Road – Repave Asphalt Driveway  1903 Quail Run Road – Replace Windows  1919 Quail Run Drive – Re-roof  1922 Quail Run Drive – Landscaping   2002 Quail Run Drive – Replace Heating/Cooling Combo  Unit  2002 Quail Run Drive – Replace Windows and Sliding  Doors  2301 Calle de Rafael – Sidewalk Installation  2722 Tramway Circle – Re-roof, Replace Skylights, and  Re-stucco Parapets  2751 Cliffrose Drive – Gate Installation  2828 Tramway Circle – Re-stucco, Paint Trim and Garage  Door  2867 Tramway Circle – Fence Replacement  2892 Tramway Circle – Patch Stucco and Color Coat  2898 Tramway Place – Gravel Installation       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.     “This Holiday Season is a perfect time to  reflect on our blessings and seek out ways to  make life better for those around us.”        9 The GRIT - December 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 12 10 The GRIT - December 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 12               Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  12700 San Rafael Ave. NE Ste. 3  Albuquerque, NM 87122                                            The SHHA office will be closed  Wednesday, December 23, 2020,  through Sunday, January 3, 2021,  for the Holidays.
