The SHHA office is open in its new location. Restrictions there in- clude wearing a mask, sanitizing your hands as you enter, and having only  one customer or customer couple in the office at any time.  Please, when you do go out, wear a mask if you’re going to be within 6  feet of others. This isn’t to protect you so much as to protect others should  you have the virus. Mask wearing is simply common courtesy and shows  respect.  This is a great time of year to enjoy the outdoors. Outdoor dining allows  the breeze to dissipate the virus more effectively than an unknown air cir- culation system indoors. Enjoy all those nice restaurants and breweries  with patios and they will enjoy having you there, too.  But most of all, stay healthy!    Fire Season Is Upon Us—A 2020 Perspective  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    As you know, Albuquerque and much of New Mexico have had a rather dry  season so far in 2020. Several recent articles I have read point out that the  American Southwest is experiencing a severe drought and many of the ma- jor reservoirs throughout this region are at record low levels. This situation  does not bode well for our fire season this summer. I thought it would be  appropriate at this time to remind you of some points about how SHHA’s  Architectural Control Committee (ACC) handles resident requests for re- ducing combustible material in the vicinity of their residences.  Most of SHHA’s unit covenants state that “natural vegetation is to be  left undisturbed where practical on all lots except for access to the prop- erty, for clearing of building sites, and for establishing lawns and flower  beds adjacent to buildings.” In addition, the ACC’s Design Guideline for  Landscaping makes the following points:  1. Sandia Heights is based on an open-space concept where natural vege- tation is of great importance. Deed restrictions require that natural veg- etation be left undisturbed where possible and replenished after con- struction is finished.  2. Residents are asked to keep their properties clear of dead trees and  other vegetation since this dead material is easily combustible.    continued on p. 2 …  2   The GRIT – July 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 7  … continued from p. 1    The key here is the use of the terms “where practi- cal” and “where possible.” These terms give you the  flexibility to make fire-wise decisions based on your per- ception of the damage to your property that could oc- cur as a result of a wildfire. Although the ACC discour- ages a “bare-earth” policy as it pertains to the removal  of vegetation on your property, reducing the amount of  combustible material and clearing dead vegetation  from areas in the vicinity of your residence make good  sense and the ACC will certainly support you mitigating  the risk to your home through reasonable elimination of  combustible vegetation.    Common Sense & Do-It-Yourself:  Reduce Opportunity for Home Thefts   & Vandalism  Parks & Safety Committee    Law enforcement officers often say, “a thief or vandal  is always on the lookout for opportunity, an easy target  to exploit and steal.” Fortunately, with a few basic pre- cautions, you can reduce the odds of becoming a victim.  To achieve this objective, lower the opportunity! Fol- lowing are a few “do-it-yourself” actions:  1. Evaluate your security.  a. If you have recently moved in, change the exte- rior locks. You don’t know who may have a spare  key left over from previous occupants of your  new living space.  b. Consider installing, or activating, an alarm sys- tem. There are many options available. Plus a  sign outside with the name of the system and/or  monitoring agency may make the would-be thief  consider someone else as their target.  c. Consider anti-shatter plastic installation on your  lower-level windows. These are available in  clear, frosted, and reflective (mirrored) film, de- pending upon your privacy needs. This proce- dure is commonly used in areas with a high fre- quency of earthquakes to prevent shattering.  d. You and your neighbors can keep an eye out for  each other. Most likely, neither of you will al- ways be home. An extra set of eyes keeping  watch in the neighborhood is a proactive and ef- fective prevention of opportunity. Perhaps this  is the beginning of a neighborhood watch  group?  e. Never invite strangers into your home. If the  doorbell should ring, it is recommended that you  go outside to answer their call. If a stranger rep- resents themselves as an official, ask for identifi- cation.  f. Beyond companionship, a dog that barks at  strangers is an excellent alarm and deterrent.  2. Keep items of fast cash value out of sight.  a. When you are not using an item, or are done for  the day, reduce the visibility to passers-by of  tools, bicycles, etc. The practice will lower temp- tation. A high percentage of petty theft occurs  during daylight hours.  b. The safe place for your automobile overnight is  in the garage. However, if that is not possible,  take things out of your car and for certain get  them out of sight.  c. Keep your blinds closed. There is no need to  broadcast the large, expensive HD TV or com- puter sitting on your desk.  d. Keep the garage door shut! If you are not pres- ently visible to a passer-by, the garage door  should be closed. There is no greater oppor- tunity than an open garage with a full display of  tools with easy access (just walk in, pick up, and  walk out).  e. Keep your home well lit. Increase visibility  around your home with outdoor lighting, partic- ularly motion-sensor lighting. Be respectful of  neighbors by aiming the light toward the ground  where a potential thief would be approaching.  (The covenants of Sandia Heights prohibit lights  shining into neighbors’ windows.)  f. If you have a fence, keeping the gate closed  along with no-trespassing signs sends the mes- sage that you take security seriously. Thieves will  notice.  There is no guarantee that you will never be the vic- tim. However, there are things one can do to reduce the  odds. Look at your home and your behavior as a thief or  vandal would look at it: is there an opportunity here, or  should I move on and look for an easier target?    3   The GRIT – July 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 7  Parking in Sandia Heights  & Construction Courtesy  A joint effort of ACC, CSC and P&S Committees    Recently, a situation arose where a contractor was  working on one property but the workers were parking  in the street and on a neighboring property without per- mission. This headache could have been avoided with  prior discussion(s) with the contractor on where labor  should park and/or the two property owners agreeing  on a prearranged solution. Folks, let’s be respectful of  our neighbors and community. Sandia Heights has some  very narrow streets that could easily become blocked by  excess or carelessly parked vehicles. Prior planning  would likely have avoided this issue.  While we’re on the topic of construction, let’s review  some points of courtesy to your neighbors and safety  for the community:  • Please limit noisy work to between 8 AM and 6 PM,  Mondays through Saturdays. Try not to schedule ex- terior work on Sundays. If your project involves sig- nificant amounts of up-front excavation, please con- sider not performing these activities on holidays or  weekend days.  • Control construction trash by using appropriate trash  containers so our local winds don’t scatter the trash.  Make sure the containers are periodically emptied  and, if possible, not placed in the street.  • Make sure your contractors provide receptacles for  the safe disposal of smoking materials such as ciga- rettes. This year may be very dry and we really don’t  need a wildfire caused by carelessly discarding ciga- rettes at a construction site. Please pay extra atten- tion to this item!  • Don’t allow your contractors to dump used concrete,  stucco “swill,” or other construction materials on  empty lots or down street gutters, into storm drains,  or on AMAFCA (Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo  Flood Control Authority) or County-controlled prop- erties such as water diversion channels. If this hap- pens, you may get stuck with cleanup costs.  • Please don’t allow your contractors to create on- street traffic problems by parking too many vehicles  on the sides of our narrow roads.  • Ask your contractors to limit the use of radios and  boom boxes at the construction site.  • Make sure that your contractors maintain proper san- itary facilities on site at all times for use by workers.    And regarding parking in general, not just contractor  parking, here are some guidelines:  • Vehicles parked on the street are on Bernalillo County  roads. That is not a violation of Zoning ordinances.  The parked vehicle cannot impede the passage of  emergency vehicles. If the parked vehicle appears  abandoned, call Bernalillo County Sherriff’s Office  (BCSO) and they will tag the car. After 5 days or so  they will tow it.  • If an unknown car is parked on private property, the  homeowner needs to call BCSO and they will investi- gate it as a crime scene. It will be towed away imme- diately.  • Both the SHHA covenants and County Zoning ordi- nances prohibit abandoned vehicles on private prop- erty.

These foothills contain many ar- royos, which were formed by the natural flow of water  due to significant elevation changes across the foothills.  Sandia Heights’ original developers elected to incorpo- rate these arroyos into the residential lots, so most of  the arroyos became part of the private property of our  homeowners.  The arroyos within Sandia Heights are on homeown- ers’ lots. Thus, those who wish to reach trails by hiking  through the arroyos in Sandia Heights are trespassing  on private property. Unless explicit permission is  granted by each homeowner whose lot includes a por- tion of the arroyo, SHHA advises that hikers refrain from  encroachment. Instead, seek access from areas desig- nated as public land. Some property owners may feel  uncomfortable with people trespassing. Their placing  “No Trespassing” signs at key locations is appropriate.  For many of the properties containing arroyos, ease- ments were created that are clearly designated on the  original plat maps and on individual property surveys.  AMAFCA (Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Con- trol Authority) established these easements to guaran- tee the free and unobstructed natural flow of water  through the arroyo system and to prevent unnecessary  downstream flooding caused by the unregulated alter- ation of those arroyos. AMAFCA owns and maintains  the largest arroyos coursing through our community,  namely, the concrete-channel arroyos designated as  North Domingo Baca Arroyo and South Domingo Baca  Arroyo.  The bottom line here is that the arroyo portions of  our properties are owned by the respective property  owners and are subject to the restrictions of the ease- ments and Unit covenants and to all County ordinances  and laws related to trespassing and other violations.  You are free to clean the arroyo portion of your prop- erty of dead organic material and trash. If you feel that  the presence of heavy amounts of vegetation in the ar- royo on your property pose a wildfire risk to your prop- erty, then you should consider taking a reasonable ap- proach to clearing or thinning the vegetation, at your  own effort and/or expense, sufficient to allay your fears  of wildfire in the arroyo.  GRIT and SHHA website articles have described our  community as a classic wildland-urban interface based  on its fire-favorable topography and vegetation.  Though there are no historical data of large wildfires in  any of our arroyos or our community, the fuel load  builds up over time if not addressed. Control of the  amount of flammable vegetation is sound fire preven- tion. However, significant alteration or outright elimina- tion of existing vegetation within the arroyos could  have a detrimental impact on natural flow channels and  on long-established wildlife habitat and movement cor- ridors. Clear-cutting or excessive thinning of vegetation  would lead to erosion and the loss of arroyos’ beauty.  Please make sensible decisions regarding how you treat  the arroyo portions of your property and keep in mind  that those arroyos and wildlife were there long before  your residence, and that their sustainability is critically  important to our foothills environment.  Arroyos within Sandia Heights may be perceived as  great hiking sites with their scenic and vast openness;  however, they are almost certainly someone’s private  property. We all can enjoy the views and experience en- joyment while hiking. Please do so respectfully and gain  hiking access via designated public land.    8   The GRIT – July 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 7    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  10 Juniper Hill Road – Install Block Wall, Retaining Wall,  Garden Wall, and Landscaping  14 Juniper Hill Road – Renovation and Garage Addition  42 Cedar Hill Place – Install a Storage Unit  171 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Landscaping   239 Spring Creek Court – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation and Landscape Railing Installation  367 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace windows and door.  512 Roadrunner Lane- Reroof and Replace Skylights  695 Bluebird Lane – Re-stucco  969 Antelope Avenue – Replace Fence and Install Stor- age Unit  726-26 Tramway Lane – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation   985 Lynx Loop – Re-stucco  985 Lynx Loop – Remove and Replace Front Patio Wall  and Landscaping   1102 Marigold Drive – Reroof   1134 Marigold Drive – Replace Heating/Cooling Systems  1167 Laurel Loop – Install Pergola, Playhouse and Re- place Concrete with Pavers on the Rear Patio and Front  Entrance  1455 Bluebell Drive – Replace Windows and Doors  1472 Morning Glory Road – Reroof, Restucco, Replace  Windows, and Replace Back Deck  1565 Eagle Ridge Court – Replace Mailbox  1727 Quail Run Court – Re-stucco  1823 Tramway Terrace Loop - Landscaping  1833 Tramway Terrace Loop – Repaint Trim, Repair and  Paint Deck Cover and Wall  2807 Tramway Circle – Replace Swamp Cooler  2809 Tramway Circle – Reroof   2829 Tramway Circle – Resurface Existing Patio  7743 Cedar Canyon Road – Replace Heating System   8251 Raintree Drive – Roof, Parapet, and Stucco Repairs  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.

We do not  want to put the health of any participant in jeopardy. We will continue to monitor the pandemic. We are considering several  alternatives and will make our decision about the tour known at a later date. Be safe.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per directions of the  Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves we will again meet on the second Saturday of every other month, hopefully  starting in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including  the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides  the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there  are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner  group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.

It has holly-like foliage armed with spines. Yellow fragrant flowers appear in the spring which form red berries in  late summer. Edible berries make excellent jellies if not eaten first by birds or other wildlife.  Algerita is native to the southern part of New Mexico, West Texas and Southeast Arizona. It is cold-hardy down  to –20°F. Plant in full sun to part shade and mix 1 part planting mix to 3 parts native soil. Plant Algerita any time of  the year it becomes available and at least 5 feet from any other plants.  Planting: Build a berm with soil 2 feet around the base of the plant. Fill up the basin twice to insure a deep  soaking. For the first two weeks you must keep plants moist! As time passes, you can decrease the frequency of  the water but increase the amount of water given. How often to water depends on many factors and the time of  year is the most important. Remember to avoid allowing the plant to dry out, but also do not keep it too wet. This  may involve checking it daily. After a year or two, deep monthly soakings are all that will be necessary to Algerita  to thrive.   Recommended use:   Anywhere  a  drought-tolerant  plant  is needed.  Because of its spiny foliage, it makes an     excellent barrier plant and shelter for birds and small  mammals. Be careful not to plant Algerita too close to  where people may brush up against it.  A related species to Algerita is the Redberry Mahonia  (Mahonia Haematocarpa). This species is also native to  New Mexico. It is taller in height (up to 12 ft) and has a  greater cold tolerance than Algerita, so it can be planted  in the East Mountain area.
