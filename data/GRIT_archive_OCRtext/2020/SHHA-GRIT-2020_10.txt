If registering by mail, your reg- istration must be postmarked by October 6. If you miss this date, you can  register just before voting at some of the early-voting locations between  October 17 and 31. You cannot register on election day, November 3.  Request absentee/mail-in ballot  All registered voters who haven’t already requested an absentee ballot will  receive an application from the County Clerk. Requests must be received by  the Clerk by 5:00 PM on October 20. Absentee ballots may be mailed in or  returned to any early-voting or election-day poll location. Absentee ballots  must be received by 7:00 PM on November 3. If it’s after October 27, rather  than mailing in and risking your ballot being late, simply drop it by a voting  location. If you request an absentee ballot then change your mind and want  to vote in person, you may still vote in person either early or on election  day. But don’t try voting twice—the Clerk checks; it won’t work.  Early voting  There are 18 early-voting locations in Bernalillo County. You may vote at any  of them. The closest to Sandia Heights is in Caracol Plaza (SW corner of  Tramway and Montgomery), 12500 Montgomery NE, Suite 101. Early voting  is October 17 through October 31, Monday – Saturday, 10 AM – 7:00 PM. At 7  of these locations, you may register just before voting; Caracol Plaza is not  one of these 7 locations.   See https://www.bernco.gov/clerk/early-voting-locations.aspx  Election-day voting  Polls will be open November 3, 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. There are 70 locations in  BernCo; you may vote at any of them. Caracol Plaza is also the closest elec- tion-day poll location to Sandia Heights.

Referring to Wastewater Ordinance  2014-17, the letters state that if your system was in- stalled before 1/1/1985 and has not had an inspection by  a qualified septic contractor within the last five years,  you are required to have the system inspected by  12/31/2020. A list of eleven wastewater system evalua- tors is attached to these letters. Here in Sandia Heights,  we have over 2200 properties and my best guess is that  about half of these properties have septic systems.  Let’s look at some scenarios. If you have your system  inspected and all parts are functioning properly, the  evaluator will submit the paperwork to the County. The  County will review the evaluation and will issue a  Wastewater Evaluation Permit if they agree with the  evaluator’s findings. The County will send you the origi- nal copy of this permit which will have an expiration  date of five years from the date the permit was issued.  The next scenario is more complicated. If part or all  of your system fails, the evaluation paperwork will de- scribe the nature of the failure and no permit will be is- sued. The County will send you a letter describing the  next steps. Typically, the County will impose a 30-day  deadline to get the system repaired or replaced, but is  willing to negotiate with you if that deadline will not  work. Once fully repaired, the system must again be  evaluated and the paperwork sent to the County. If the  evaluation is acceptable, a permit will be issued to you.  Some additional thoughts:  1. Don’t ignore these letters if you get one. The County  has some not-too-pleasant ways to deal with residents  who ignore their letter. Since septic systems, particu- larly older ones, have been identified as a main source  of groundwater contamination, the County’s objective  with these inspections is to ensure the protection of  public health and the environment.  2. Due to the potential for conflict of interest, the Ordi- nance allows residents to contract directly with a quali- fied provider of their choosing—there is no require- ment to select from the County’s list. There is also no  requirement to use a provider from the County’s list to  perform any repairs.  3. I wrote a GRIT article in August 2019 on basic tips to  help keep your septic system functioning efficiently.  This GRIT edition is available on the SHHA website.  4. The permit for your septic system is not transferable.  The permit will expire when the owner sells the prop- erty or when the tenant or occupancy classification  changes. A new permit must be obtained within 30 days  of the property being transferred/sold or a change in  the tenancy or occupancy classification.  5. My advice is to have your system inspected at the  same time that you have it pumped. The cost for both  of these actions when done in tandem is around $400– $500. If you have had your system evaluated in the past  five years, the County will accept the evaluation.  6. Beginning in January 2021, these letters will require  systems installed before 1/1/1986 to be inspected prior  to 12/31/2021.    Update on Cottonwood Trees   in Little Cloud Park    Bernalillo County Parks & Recreation suggested remov- ing 2 of the 4 cottonwood trees in Little Cloud Park due  to a tripping hazard. Numerous residents and SHHA  Parks & Recreation Committee objected. We have re- ceived confirmation from Tom Thorpe, Communication  Service Administrator, that the trees will be removed  only if necessary after exhausting other options, such as  back filling the exposed roots with soil or tree bark.     Into the Clouds, Part 1  The Short, Tragic Flight of TWA 260  By Hugh Prather, SHHA Member  Less than 2 miles due east of the Sandia Heights boundary  with the Sandia Wilderness, but 4 steep, uphill miles by  trail from the tram terminal, a hiker encounters the de- bris field of the tragic TWA accident that took the lives of  16 people and spawned a series of myths and legends.  Here’s the first part of the real story.  Saturday morning, February 19, 1955, dawned crisp,  cold, and cloudy in the Albuquerque foothills. Had San- dia Heights existed at the time, we who lived here  would have seen heavy cloud cover down to about the  7,000-foot level—slightly below the first tram tower  (had the tram been built at the time). The bulk of the  Sandias would have been totally obscured. If, on the  other hand, you happened to be a TWA passenger or  crew member waiting at the Albuquerque Municipal Air- port on that brisk morning, you would have seen clear  skies to the south, west, and directly north, but you  would not have seen the Sandias—they were com- pletely shrouded in clouds.  Continued on page 3…  3   The GRIT – October 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 10    …continued from page 2  There were 13 ticketed passengers ready to board  the TWA Skyliner “Binghamton,” a Martin 404 40-pas- senger aircraft decked out in bright white and red TWA  livery. TWA had a long, tightly connected history with  the city of Albuquerque. After the Albuquerque Munici- pal Airport opened in 1939 (in the older, pueblo-style  building immediately west of the current Sunport that  currently houses TSA), TWA had scheduled flights to  and from this airport as part of its transcontinental  routes. This particular aircraft had been delivered to  TWA from the factory in Baltimore, Maryland, in mid- 1951 and was one of 41 which had been purchased in an  attempt by TWA to provide improved, profitable short- haul capacity.  Unlike its predecessor the Martin 202, the 404 was  pressurized and, therefore, could fly higher and in much  smoother air. One of the  advantages for smaller  airports that the Martin  had been designed to ac- cess was the fold-down  rear stairs that allowed  passengers to board at  ground level from the  rear of the aircraft. The aircraft on the flight line that  morning had tail number N-40416. It was powered by  two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 CB16 18-cylinder radial en- gines each generating 2,400 horsepower. Normal cruis- ing elevation was around 18,000 feet. Skyliner Bing- hamton had arrived in Albuquerque the night before af- ter a flight originating in Fresno, California.   The three-person flight crew that morning—Captain  Ivan Spong, First Officer J.J. Creason, and Stewardess  Sharon Schoening—was preparing for departure and  had a busy day ahead of them. Flight 260 was scheduled  to leave at 7 AM and make a short 26-minute hop to  Santa Fe. From there, the next stop would be Amarillo,  then on to Wichita, Topeka, and Kansas City, where the  crew would be replaced with a fresh crew. Flight 260  would continue east, ultimately ending its run at 11 PM in  Baltimore. The plane would never reach Santa Fe.  The passengers ready to board Flight 260 repre- sented a wide range of professions and backgrounds.  One family group of three from New Jersey were taking  a short business flight from Albuquerque to Santa Fe  and being picked up there for a drive up to Los Alamos,  where some further business would be negotiated. An  elementary school teacher from Albuquerque was en  route to Oklahoma City where she was planning to  interview for an over- seas teaching position.  Two nuclear scientists  from Kansas City were  returning there from Las  Vegas, Nevada, after  having participated in an  underground  nuclear  test. A Ph.D. geologist from New Mexico Tech was en  route to a conference. An oil executive from Oklahoma  was returning after exploring some possible petroleum  leases in the northwest corner of the state. The CEO of  a shoe store chain was returning to home base in Cincin- nati after visiting a recently opened branch in Albuquer- que. There were a minister and an insurance sales- man—a cross-section of middle-class America.  Flight 260 opened for boarding at 6:35, and while  Stewardess Schoening greeted the passengers who  had walked from the airport portal and climbed the  wheeled stair ramp to the front entrance door on the  left side of the fuselage, Captain Spong and First Officer  Creason were busy with a preflight check. By 6:50 pas- sengers were settled with seatbelts in place and the  cockpit door was closed. The 404 preflight checklist  contained 45 items before the engines were started and  five more after they were running. In addition, before  they were to taxi, 17 more items were checked and then  they were ready to move to the flight line.  Spong and Creason reviewed the flight plan with en- gines idling. They were to taxi to runway 11, (now called  runway 12 which heads south east from the main termi- nal) and after a successful takeoff make a right turn to  bring them around to almost a true north heading  where they would follow the back course of the instru- ment landing system to an intersection point in the air  north of Algodones. From that instrument-derived in- tersection, they would then make a northeast turn and  clear for landing in Santa Fe. The flight plan had them  climbing to 9000 feet and maintaining that elevation for  the duration of the short flight.  At 7 AM and right on schedule, Spong released the  brakes and advanced throttles as he steered the Sky- liner toward the beginning of runway 11. The pilots re- quested takeoff clearance. The tower responded, “TWA  260, wind south 10 cleared for takeoff runway one one.”  With a light passenger load and throttles fully advanced  the Martin 404 picked up speed rapidly down the run- way and lifted off gracefully at 7:05 AM. The 16 souls on  board had less than 10 minutes to live.

Here are the two takes on everyone’s fa- vorite ugly critter.    A Freaky Friendly  By Elizabeth Edgren, SHHA Member    Last year, as my husband was setting up his workshop  in the garage of our new home in Sandia Heights, he en- countered an alien creature that looked like it came  straight out of a nightmare. He whipped out his phone  to take a picture before he crushed the monster. Later  though, we learned from a local workman that this crea- ture was a “friendly” and we ought never kill one.   The vinegaroon, or whip scorpion, or Mastigoproctus  giganteus giganteus, looks threatening indeed, due to  its size of 2"–3" not counting its whip tail, which can be  longer than its body.    Photos and information from the University of Florida,   http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/misc/giant_whip_scorpion.htm    This not-so-little fella catches and crushes its prey in  its pedipalps, or front pincers. They can give us a “no- ticeable pinch,” says the U of FL article, although they  don’t bite or sting. What is its prey? Not us, but other  arthropods—critters like crickets, roaches, or termites.  Although it resembles a scorpion, the vinegaroon isn’t  venomous. Its nickname of vinegaroon comes from the  fact that when it’s threatened, it can spread its pedi- palps, rear up its back end, and spray an 85% concentra- tion of acetic acid from the base of its “tail,” possibly up  to a foot away. The spray isn’t dangerous, but can really  sting if gotten in the eyes or nostrils.  Although they have eight eyes, six of which are on  their sides near the base of the front feeler-legs, their  vision is poor, so those long, thin, front legs act as feel- ers, and the “whip” is also sensory, a big help to the  weak-eyed arachnid.  Vinegaroons are nocturnal, often hiding during the  day in burrows or under rocks or dead wood or in other  dark places. They mate in the fall, and when the mama’s  eggs hatch, they climb onto her back for about a month.  Whip scorpions grow slowly, molting about once a year  for three years, but they can then live up to another four  years! (Long enough to adopt as a pet?) But once a  mother vinegaroon has sent her babies out into the  world, her life cycle is finished, and she soon dies.  They can become more active during rainy periods,  which may explain why I encountered three of these  beauties in our bedroom last month, separately, within  a single week. Good thing it was daylight, and good  thing we knew they were our friends! We captured each  one gently and restored it with our blessing to the great  outdoors. If you meet one unawares, now you’ll know  to try to live as good neighbors with these fearsome  looking characters.    Don’t Squash This Bug!  By Kate Fry, SHHA Member    Photo: University of Texas at El Paso  This creepy-looking critter is not a scorpion, even  though it tries to look like one. This masquerade is what  gets them squashed by people who don’t know what  they are. This is a vinegaroon (Mastigoproctus gigan- teus), sometimes called a whipscorpion or grampus. It  can grow to 3" long or more, not including the tail.  Wait, didn’t I just say it wasn’t a scorpion? Why is it  called a whipscorpion? The answer is obvious if you look  at the long, thin tail. Vinegaroons are related to spiders  and have eight legs, although the first pair of legs is  used like antennae and not for walking. They are com- pletely harmless to humans—the tail does not have a  stinger, although the curved mouthparts can deliver a  pinch. The name “vinegaroon” comes from the crea- ture’s habit, when threatened, of spraying a mist from  the base of its tail that is primarily acetic acid, or vinegar.  Legend has it that if a vinegaroon bites you, everything  will taste like vinegar for weeks. Of course, this is not  true, but if you get a spray of vinegar in your face you  probably won’t like it! Vinegaroons are nocturnal, and  they prey on insects and other arthropods.  So, if you happen to see a vinegaroon, be happy that  it’s keeping the cricket and other insect populations in  balance. It’s another of our wild neighbors that we can’t  do without—even though it isn’t exactly cute!  8   The GRIT – October 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 10  ACC Activity Log  Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  3 Sandia Heights Dr – Replace Existing Carport and Slab  10 Juniper Hill Rd – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel In- stallation  42 Cedar Hill Pl – Replace Windows  367 Big Horn Ridge Dr – Replace Windows  407 Live Oak Loop – Extension of Existing Garage, Addi- tion of a Two-Car Garage, and Craft Studio  425 Live Oak Loop – Reroof and Pave Driveway with As- phalt  551 Black Bear Rd – Re-roof with TPO  554 Black Bear Pl – Construct Patio Cover  659 Roadrunner Lane – Replace Garage Door  726-8 Tramway Vista P – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  727-1 Cedar Hill Lane – Shade Sails Installation   793 Tramway Lane Units D, E, O, P and 795 Tramway  Lane Units D, E, K, N, O, P Replace Garage Doors  867-F Tramway Lane Ct – Replace Windows and Patio  Doors  905 Tramway Ln – Replace Swamp Cooler w/ HVAC Unit  917 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   951 Deer Dr – Upgrade Deck  1043 Red Oaks Loop – Re-stucco and Replace Windows  1104 San Rafael Ave – Resurface Asphalt Driveway  1145 Marigold Dr – Re-stucco Mailbox and Landscape  1452 Honeysuckle Dr – Replace Garage Doors  1536 Eagle Ridge Dr – Replace Windows, Evaporative  Cooler, and Mechanical Screen Installation  1560 Eagle Ridge Rd – Replace Garage Doors  1911 Quail Run Rd – Fence Installation and Landscaping  1942 Quail Run Loop – Replace Concrete Slab in Back- yard  2308 Calle de Rafael – Replace Awnings  2324 Calle de Gabriel – Sealcoat Asphalt Driveway  2414 Tramway Terrace Ct – Roof/Skylight Repair, Re- Stucco, Replace Windows and Sliding Glass Door, and  Reinsulate Refrigerant Lines  2414 Tramway Terrace Ct – Repaint Garage Door  2807 Tramway Circle – Shade Structure Installation, Hot  Tub Slab and Pavers, Replace Wood Fence, and New  Block Wall Section  7729 Cedar Canyon Ct – Re-roof with TPO  7733 Cedar Canyon Rd – Flagpole with Light Installation  7741 Cedar Canyon Rd – Replace Sliding Glass Doors  12621 Colony Pl – Re-roof  12622 Colony Pl – Roof Mounted PV Panel Installation       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.   Plant of the Season  Historical article from Summer 1997 GRIT    Russian Sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia) is a multi-stemmed  deciduous shrub or perennial that grows 4 ft. tall with an  equal spread. The foliage has a lacy appearance, is light  gray-green in color and has an aromatic sagelike fragrance.  Lavender-blue flowers occur in long 18 in. spikes in summer  and may last till the first frost.  Russian Sage is native to Western Asia and is cold hardy  to at least –200°F [sic, no doubt meant –20°F]. Plant in full  sun to semi-shade in any well drained soil. Mix 1 part plant- ing mix to 3 parts native soil for best results. Growth rate  may be slow the first year but is much faster the following  year.    Planting: Build a berm with soil 2 feet around the base of  the plant. Fill the basin twice with water to insure a deep  soaking. For the first 2 weeks keep the plants moist! As time  passes, decrease the frequency but increase the amount of  water given. How often to water depends upon many fac- tors such as the time of year and plant maturity. Once es- tablished, Russian Sage can survive on deep soakings every  2–3 weeks during the growing season.  Recommended Use: Russian Sage is a durable, drought  tolerant plant that does not grow too tall. Use in the land- scape as an accent plant or to contrast against green  shrubs. Fragrant foliage is an additional asset for this plant.  Because the flowers attract bees, avoid planting too close  to walkways, swimming pools or anywhere people may  congregate.  In Winter cut back the old flower stalks and in the colder  East Mountain and Santa Fe areas, cut back 6–12 inches  from the ground Related species include: Perovskia “Blue  Spire” and Perovskia “Blue Haze” (lighter blue) which are  both hybrid crosses between P. atriplicifolia and P. abrota- noides.  9 The GRIT - October 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 10 10 The GRIT - October 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 10 11   The GRIT – October 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 10  Community Event Bulletin Board      This group is not sponsored by SHHA.

When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of  every other month, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people,  including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year  progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some  part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a  September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005,  with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join  any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
