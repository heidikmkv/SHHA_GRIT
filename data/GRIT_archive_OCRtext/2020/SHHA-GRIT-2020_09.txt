Hugh Prather, SHHA Member    October 6, 2020 will be here before you know it!  “What’s important about October 6?” you ask. Simply  this: if you are not registered to vote by that time you  will not be able to vote in the upcoming general election  on November 3.  Given the crazy restrictions we are all living with at  the moment, one of our neighbors, Hugh Prather, a 25- year-plus Sandia Heights resident and former SHHA  board member and a Bernalillo County Voter Registra- tion Agent, is offering to make it as easy as possible for  you to register if you are not current with your voter  registration. He will come to your home at your re- quest—complete with mask and gloves, identification  and documents—and meet you on your front porch or  in your driveway where you can have your voter regis- tration completed in a short five minutes.  To take Hugh Prather up on this offer simply call  (505) 321-1467 or email hugh.h.prather@gmail.com to  arrange a mutually convenient time for him to drop by  and get you registered. There is no fee for this service  and this is completely nonpartisan.  October 6 will be here before you know it!  [Note: you can also register at the SHHA office.]    Because of Covid-19, the November  3, 2020, Election Will Be Different  By George Richmond, Sandia Heights resident    Based on the primary, elections this November will be  operated by poll workers wearing face masks and clean- ing surfaces after every voter. And voters should wear  face masks and keep their “social distance” as they line  up and enter the polling place. Thus, voting times will be  longer than usual. There will be early voting October 17– 31, voting on Election Day (Tuesday November 3), and  absentee voting or voting by mail. In the June 2020 Pri- mary Election, voting via mail was very high. In New  Mexico, voter turnout was at 40%, up from about 34% in  2016. Of the nearly 400,000 votes cast, more than  270,000 came from absentee ballots, according to Sec- retary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.   Now about registering: if you voted in the last elec- tion and did not move, no problem. If you have moved,  then you must re-register to vote. You can check your  registration and request an absentee/vote-by-mail bal- lot at the Bernalillo County Clerk’s website:  https://www.bernco.gov/clerk/voter-registration.aspx   The local elections are very relevant for voters in San- dia Heights. After voting for President, US Senator and  Member of Congress, continue down the voting page to  NM House District 31, which includes the incumbent and  two challengers; NM Senate District 20, where the in- cumbent is retiring and the seat is open; NM Senate Dis- trict 18, incumbent and a challenger; and Bernalillo  County Commission, the incumbent will leave office at  the end of his term and there are two challengers. Also,  there are judges and Bernalillo County bond issues to  vote on. I know, there is a lot to consider, but I encour- age all of you to stick with it and make your mark Up or  Down.   Several bond issues will be on the ballot. Please read  over them. Here is what Clay Campbell, Chief of Staff for  the County Manager, shared with me:  Bernalillo County will have six general-obligation bond ques- tions on the November ballot. This information was compiled  in the spring, packaged and presented online in late June, and  is now being advertised as summarized below. The commis- sion will consider these six questions for approval at their Au- gust 11 hearing. After that vote, the Bernalillo County Capital  Improvement Program will finalize its 2020 General Obligation  (GO) Bond booklet inclusion in the 2020 Voters Guide. This  booklet will have a brief description, estimated project cost,  and committed funding in place for each of the various capital  projects proposed to receive 2020 GO Bond funding.  The six questions are for 1) libraries, 2) public safety and  county buildings, 3) parks and recreation, 4) transporta- tion, 5) storm drainage, and 6) public housing.  A sum- mary of these six questions can be viewed at  https://www.bernco.gov/capital-improvement-pro- gram/2020-public-meetings-online-feedback.aspx.   I wrote to the County Clerk’s office on the voting  process. Here is his answer.  The County website provides all of the voting convenience cen- ter locations but does not display wait times for each voting  location. Additionally, it is difficult to predict the necessary  length of time for an absentee ballot to arrive in our office  from the USPS. Our office recommends sending the absentee  ballot as soon as possible. If there is any concern that the ballot  will not be received in our office prior to 7PM election night by  mail, the voter can drop off the ballot at any of our voting con- venience centers during early voting and election-day voting  hours. Our office is encouraging the voter to vote by any  method that keeps them most safe and comfortable during  this current health climate. The avenue to vote via absentee is  a safe and secure method of voting that is available to all reg- istered voters. Furthermore, our office will take all safety pre- cautions and preventative/sanitization methods at all polling  locations if the voter is so inclined to vote that avenue as well.  PLEASE VOTE! And then talk with/meet the elected of- ficials—share your views of what you want them to do!  3   The GRIT – September 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 9  Photo by Bob Fugate  Legal Bow Hunting in Cibola  Parks & Safety Committee    Immediately east of the Sandia Heights housing devel- opment is a part of the Cibola National Forest. The New  Mexico Department of Game and Fish refers to that  same area as “Unit-8.” There are legal deer and bear  hunting seasons allowed inside Unit-8; however, bow is  the only legal weapon to be used in Unit-8. Legal bear  hunting season is generally between October 15–No- vember 15. Deer season is split into a two-tiered season  with the last week in November reserved for youth and  the first two weeks of January being open to all ages.  NM Department of Game and Fish annually publish a  book of “rules & info.” Page 22 of the 2019–2020 publi- cation lists the general rules hunter should follow. One  specific rule of interest to Sandia Heights Homeowners  is, “It is unlawful to discharge a firearm within 150 yards  of a dwelling or building without the permission of the  owner or lessee.” Bows are considered a firearm!  Another rule labeled as “Criminal Trespass” appears  on page 27 of the same publication and could be of  value to those residents with property adjacent to Unit  8. That rule reads, “It is unlawful to knowingly enter  upon any private property to hunt, capture, take, at- tempt to take, or kill any game animal, furbearer, game  bird, or game fish without possessing written permis- sion from the landowner or person in control of the land  or trespass rights unless otherwise permitted in rule or  statute.”  Legal shooting hours are from ½ hour before sunrise  to ½ hour after sunset.

Light Pollution  Covenant Support Committee  Most of the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants address  light pollution. This is done to preserve our enjoyment  of the night sky. Regardless of the individual covenants  for your Unit, the entirety of North Albuquerque Acres  and Sandia Heights fall under the Bernalillo County  Code for light pollution. The code includes, but is not re- stricted to, security lighting, street lights, landscape  lights, building-mounted area lights, and building fa- çade lights. In general, lights shall remain OFF between  11:00PM and sunrise. Lights on buildings shall be  mounted no higher than 16 feet and all lights must be  shielded so the light is pointed directly to the ground.  Bulbs should not be more than 75 watts.   To see the entire code and any exceptions, go to the  Bernalillo County Website (www.bernco.gov) and look  under ordinances, Section 30-186. If you leave your  lights or house floods on at the entry, garage doors, etc.  after 11:00PM and they are not shielded, they are in vio- lation of the county code. While the CSC does not en- force county ordinances, we will work with homeown- ers to make them aware of their options. At night, even  a 40-watt bulb in an unshielded fixture is a distraction to  those who wish to enjoy the night sky, the darkness of  the neighborhood, or the lights of the city below.  Bernco can help with light pollution.  SHHA cannot enforce county codes and ordinances  such as light, noise, traffic, and on-street parking. Only  what is stated in the covenants can be enforced by  SHHA. However, the county will enforce their ordi- nances, including those for light pollution.  Recently a homeowner filed a covenant violation  with SHHA citing a large number of outdoor lights lo- cated at a property across the street which were shining  into their living room and bedroom windows. There are  38 units in Sandia Heights, each with their own set of  covenants, but with regard to lighting most state “No  un-shaded flood lights shall be maintained which cause  light directly into the homes of other residents in the  Subdivision.” In this particular case, there were no bare  flood lights and, therefore, with a strict, legal interpre- tation of the covenants the SHHA could not act. The  complainant was informed that there was no covenant  violation but there might be a violation of the county  lighting ordinances. The homeowner then filed a viola- tion complaint with Bernalillo County. This can be done  on-line and provides a tracking number so you can log  in and review their investigation. In this case, the county  investigator visited the alleged violator’s property  within a couple of weeks and found that there were sev- eral ordinance violations that needed to be addressed.  Bernco gave the homeowner a month to complete cor- rective actions.  If you have questions about the SHHA covenants or  how to contact Bernco and file a county ordinance vio- lation, please contact the SHHA office at 797-7793 or  www.sandiahomeowners.org.    4   The GRIT – September 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 9      JULY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Talk about pride-in-ownership, the  recent Parade of Homes tour was incredible from the  minute you stepped onto the property. Can you say  that about your home’s first impression?  In these unprecedented times, from Covid 19 to  global demonstrations, are you destroying your  property value by not taking pride in ownership?  When I walk through the neighborhood and see  cars on blocks, weeds overtaking the front yards  and driveways, and dog poop left for others to  clean up, I am saddened and appalled.  Why does this upset up me? Because I served in the  military for over 34 years and have seen abject poverty  and war-torn destruction from Iraq to Haiti. We have so  much to be grateful for but, for some homeowners,  they choose not to take care of their property.  Are you aware of the broken window theory, which  is exactly what is happening in Sandia Heights? The the- ory, according to Psychology Today, states that “visible  signs of disorder and misbehavior in an environment en- courage further disorder and misbehavior, leading to  serious crimes.” It starts with ignoring one weed and  then two and before you know it your yard looks horri- ble, cars are on blocks, and poop is in the streets.  We live in a community with incredible natural  beauty. We have responsibilities as homeowners as well  as to our neighbors and community at large. I challenge  each of you to reverse this trend of the broken window  theory by pulling just one weed…and then another.  – Your neighbor who cares.    (historical article from Aug-Sep 1980 GRIT)  Same Old Reminders:  1)  Drive carefully. Remember to watch for children  around school bus stops and watch for others bicycling  or playing in the streets. Our roads have unexpected  hills and turns that make seeing children and oncoming  vehicles difficult.  2)  Try to contain your dog. One family’s pet may be an- other family’s nuisance.  [ed., Sound familiar? Some things never seem to  change. So let’s change them—what do you say?]  (another historical article from Sep 1986 GRIT)    Nestled in the mouth of Pino Canyon is Albert G. Simms  Park protecting this unique foothills habitat. Even  though the park has attracted thousands of people, you  can still find large herds of mule deer and signs of the  elusive mountain lion. The focal point for Simms Park is  the Elena Gallegos Picnic Area which is open daily at  8:00 a.m. for picnicking and trailhead parking. A small  network of trails within the park will take you to the  Sandia Mountain Wilderness. The U.S.D.A. Forest Ser- vice is planning to open a trail from the park to the Crest  trail later this year. [They did, too. It’s Pino Trail.] For  more information about the park or becoming a volun- teer call 823-4016, Monday through Friday.    Michael D.

Monthly Fun Fact  By Matt Pedigo, SHHA Member    Albuquerque was founded in 1706 and is one of the  nation’s oldest inland communities. Albuquerque  was named after the 10th Duke of Alburquerque,  Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, who was the Vice- roy of New Spain. The first “r” in the spelling got  lost somewhere along the way.      9 The GRIT - September 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 9 10 The GRIT - September 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 9 11   The GRIT – September 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 9  Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups is sponsored by SHHA.

Sandia Heights Artists: The Sandia Heights Artists will have a virtual art tour on Saturday, September 12 and  Sunday, September 13 from 10 AM to 5 PM. Twenty artists are participating. Some can be accessed in person and  some virtually. All information ca be found on our website: www.sandiaheightsartists.com. Jewelry, gourd art,  paintings, glass, mixed media, and clay works are some of the artistic products for your viewing. We want  everyone to stay safe and healthy so we will take every precaution to that end.       Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per  directions of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of  every other month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner  group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating  (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with  attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on  food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was  started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
