    Coronavirus Update    As of writing this in mid-May, Governor Lujan Grisham has allowed some  easing of restrictions and a slow reopening of businesses. The SHHA office  reopened May 20 under the following restrictions. All customers must  wear a mask; the staff will as well. Sanitize your hands upon entering. Only  one person or couple allowed in the office at a time. Please visit only for  essential business, which includes construction/remodel applications, cov- enant violation complaints, notary services, review of contractor binders,  and copy/fax service. Please adhere to social distance guidelines.  The Governor’s May 9 public letter reads, in part, “Let me be clear by  what I mean when I say social distancing. Social distancing does not mean  going about your regular life with your friends and family with a little bit of  extra space between you. Each coronavirus infection is a risk to others.  Every single death is a tragedy. Saying that ‘there are going to be deaths  anyway,’ is simply unacceptable. Social distancing does mean staying true  to the responsibility we have to our neighbors, our loved ones and our  communities, to keep one another safe. You have a newfound super  power right now: the ability to save lives. By staying home as much as you  can, by keeping six feet distance from people, by always wearing personal  protective masks when you do go out, and by washing your hands and fre- quently used surfaces, you can help protect yourself and vulnerable New  Mexicans. Social distancing is, ultimately, what will allow us to reopen New  Mexico’s economy. Right now, we’re tentatively hoping to begin ‘phase  one’ of reopening New Mexico in mid-May—but only if that course of ac- tion is supported by science and data.”  Looks like we’ll be sheltering in place for the foreseeable future. We’ll  say it again: Sandia Heights is a great place to shelter in place!  On the lighter side, your GRIT editor wrote a parody on Don McLean’s  “American Pie” for our current times.

The Tram Co. assigned its rights and duties to enforce  the various covenants for Sandia Heights to the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) and its Archi- tectural Control Committee (ACC), and filed this Assign- ment with Bernalillo County on February 27, 1995. After  this Assignment, the duties of what had been the Tram  Co.’s ACC were reallocated, with SHHA’s ACC being re- sponsible for monitoring and upholding the covenants.  Thereafter, SHHA’s Board delegated the responsibility  of enforcing certain aspects of the Covenants to its Cov- enant Support Committee (CSC), as provided in SHHA’s  Bylaws.  The Covenants allow the Grantor (or its assign,  SHHA) and any property owner the ability to enforce  the Covenants. SHHA also has standing to sue and en- force the Covenants on behalf of its members because  (1) its members would have standing to sue in their own  right,  (2) the interests SHHA seeks to protect are germane to  SHHA’s purpose, and   (3) neither the claims asserted, nor the relief requested  requires the participation of individual members in this  lawsuit.   See American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico v. City  of Albuquerque, 2008-NMSC-045, ¶ 30, 144 N.M. 471;  Forest Guardians v. Powell, et al., 2001-NMCA-028, ¶ 21,  130 N.M. 368. SHHA meets these requirements.     Seller Responsibility  Under New Mexico law, it is a clearly defined obliga- tion for a seller (owner) of a property to make certain  that all disclosures, including the relevant and applica- ble Covenants, are provided to prospective purchasers  prior to the date of closing.  Relative to the sale of individual lots (whether im- proved or not; i.e., regardless of whether there is a  home on the lot), statute NMSA 1978 § 47-16-12 requires  that no later than 7 days before closing, a lot owner shall  “furnish to a purchaser copies of (1) the declaration of  the association, other than the plats and plans; (2) the  bylaws of the association; (3) any covenants, conditions  or restrictions applicable to the lot; (4) the rules of the  association; and (5) a disclosure certificate from the as- sociation.”  New Mexico law does not suggest that any party  other than the seller of a parcel or home constructed on  a lot in Sandia Heights has an obligation to furnish the  materials described in the statute to a prospective pur- chaser. To this end, absent their ownership of a prop- erty for sale, there is no specific legal obligation im- posed upon lenders, real estate brokers or title compa- nies to furnish information relative to the SHHA Bylaws,  Covenants, or other documents specific to the subject  property.   The Homeowner’s Association Act which took effect  July 1, 2013, further provides that a seller of a property  located in an HOA must provide the HOA’s community  documents to a potential buyer. The NM Association of  Realtors form, “Seller’s Disclosure of Homeowner’s As- sociation Documents” states in section 1, “The New  Mexico HOA Act requires Seller or Seller’s Agent/Broker  to provide the following HOA Documents to Buyer.” It  goes on to list the documents. The seller is responsible  for accurately filling out and then signing this Disclosure  and providing it along with the HOA’s community docu- ments to a potential buyer.    The title company is responsible for doing a search  on the property and providing a Title Commitment  along with all documents referred to therein for the  buyer’s review. This would include the Codes, Cove- nants and Restrictions (CCR) as they are recorded, but  not any of the other HOA documents.    Buyer Responsibility  All homeowners in Sandia Heights, regardless of  whether or not they are members of SHHA, are bound  by the SHHA Covenants for their specific unit. When you  purchase your property, under New Mexico law it is the  responsibility of the seller to disclose the SHHA Cove- nants/Community Documents to you. It is not the re- sponsibility of the transaction real estate brokers, the  lender or the title company. Even if you have not been  informed of the Covenants, you are still bound by the  SHHA Covenants for your specific unit. The SHHA Cove- nants are legal Use Restrictions and are enforced by the  Covenant Support Committee to maintain the value of  your property and your neighbor’s property.     3   The GRIT – June 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 6  11 Rules for Staying Safe While Walking  Parks & Safety Committee    This article is adapted from one written by Wendy Bum- garder and found at www.verywellfit.com.  Walking is a healthy activity, but you need to know  the rules of thumb for pedestrian safety. This is espe- cially true if you are walking in areas of Sandia Heights  where there aren’t sidewalks or paths separated from  the road. Always observe traffic safety rules when walk- ing in public areas. To stay safe walking, follow these  rules of the road!  1. Walk Facing Traffic. If there is no sidewalk and you  must walk on the side of the road, choose the left  side where you are facing oncoming traffic. Walking  opposite traffic gives you the best chance to see ve- hicles approaching and be able to take evasive ac- tion when needed. This may be confusing because  the opposite rule is true for cyclists, who must travel  in the same direction as the vehicular traffic flow.  2. Cross Safely. Your mother was right—you should  look both ways before crossing any street. At con- trolled intersections, it is wise to cross only when  you have the pedestrian crossing light. Even then,  vehicles and cyclists may have a green light to turn  and won’t be expecting you to be in the crosswalk.  Make eye contact with any driver or cyclist who may  be turning. Give them a wave. Make sure they see  you. In an interaction between a vehicle or a cyclist  and a walker, the walker can only lose! Even if you  are obeying traffic signs and signals, motorists and  cyclists might not notice you. Always stay aware of  surroundings when crossing any street.  3. Walk on Roads Single File. Unless you are on a side- walk separated from the road or you are in a wide  bike/pedestrian lane, you should walk in single file.  This is especially important on a road with lots of  curves, or un-level terrain (such as Sandia Heights)  where traffic has only a split-second chance of see- ing you. Walking abreast can also cause you to be- come distracted by conversations with your walking  buddy(s) and create a situation of not paying proper  attention to traffic or road signs. While it can be en- joyable to walk down the road two to three abreast  chatting, drivers don’t expect it, and you would lose  in that collision!  4. Stay Aware of Bikes and Runners. Share the road or  path with cyclists and runners. Bike riders should  alert you when approaching from behind with a bike  bell or a “passing on the left/right.” Listen for them,  and move to walk single file, allowing them to pass  safely. Runners should also call out when passing.  5. Be Visible. Wear bright colors when walking in the  daytime. At night, wear light-colored reflective  clothing or a reflective vest to increase visibility and  carry a light. Drivers are often not expecting walkers  to be out after dark and you need to give them every  chance to see you. Be just as cautious at dawn or twi- light, when drivers still have limited visibility.  6. Be Predictable. Make a practice of staying on one  side of the path while walking rather than weaving  randomly from side to side.  7. Keep the Volume Down. Don’t drown out your envi- ronment when listening to music with your earbuds  or headphones. Keep the volume at a level where  you can still hear bike bells and warnings from oth- ers using the same path.  8. Hang Up and Eyes Up. Distracted walking due to  chatting, texting, or playing games on a mobile de- vice while you walk is almost as dangerous as doing  those things while driving. You are distracted and  not as aware of your environment. You are less likely  to recognize traffic danger, tripping hazards, or  passing joggers and cyclists. Adopt habits that can  keep your phone in your pocket, or at least make it a  practice to stop in a safe place to complete your call.  9. Walk Dogs on Short Leashes. It is terrifying and  tragic to see dogs running out into traffic or getting  into a dog fight, whether on or off a leash. But when  walking your dog on a long leash, there is also a dan- ger that you will trip other walkers or cyclists. You  will keep your dog safer—as well as those who pass  by you—if you use proper leash walking etiquette.  Bernalillo County laws require dogs be leashed at all  times except in explicitly designated locations.  10. Know When to Stop Walking. Heat exhaustion, de- hydration, heart attack, or stroke can strike walkers  of any age. Learn the symptoms of medical emer- gencies and carry your cell phone (in your pocket) to  dial 911. Even if you are a seasoned, well-trained  walker, you may experience one of these problems  and need to cut your walk short.  11. Be Aware of Stranger Danger. Street safety is a con- cern for many walkers. Choose your walking route  for paths frequented by other walkers, joggers, and  cyclists. Acting alert and aware can dissuade danger- ous people from making you a target.    Enjoy these rules for safer walking in Sandia Heights!  4   The GRIT – June 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 6      APRIL CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

I hope the information is useful!]   As many of you know, emergency situations involv- ing your home can occur from time to time. If you hap- pen to encounter a situation such as a broken or  clogged water or sewer line, repair or replacement of  your septic system, a leaky roof, stucco damage (partic- ularly at the parapet locations), a large tree or tree  branch that may pose a danger to your property if not  trimmed or removed, a collapsed garage door, or any  other situation where the urgency of the issue requires  quick action on your part in order to prevent or mini- mize property damage, the ACC does not want to stand  in your way. You do not need to submit an ACC applica- tion form for these types of situations. Just let the SHHA  office know that you are tending to an emergency situ- ation and, if applicable, heavy equipment may be  needed to fix the problem. The phone number at the  SHHA office is 797-7793. This information will help the  office answer questions from your neighbors who may  be inquiring about what is going on at your residence.  As a reminder, be careful when selecting a contractor  to handle an emergency repair or for any other repairs  or modifications to your residence. There are many  individuals looking for business and some of these folks  may not be properly licensed or insured. You bear the  risk of poor-quality workmanship and a host of other  problems if you choose to use an unlicensed or unin- sured contractor. I have included articles in The GRIT on  this subject over the past several years, so take some  time and familiarize yourself with just how to make sure  your contractor is properly licensed and insured before  you “sign on the dotted line.” Don’t be a victim of an  unlicensed or uninsured contractor!  Once your emergency issue has been solved and you  wish to pursue a permanent fix, you are then required  to submit an application to the ACC. Examples of this in- clude replacing your roof, re-stuccoing your residence,  or replacing a large tree. Keep in mind that trees which  will exceed the height of your roofline when they reach  maturity are not authorized since they can interfere  with the views of your neighbors. The ACC does not  need an application for replacement or repair of your  septic system. Wastewater systems are handled by the  Bernalillo County Public Works Department and they  will issue the proper permits and perform the proper in- spections to ensure that the septic system meets  County requirements.  From all of the members of the ACC, please remem- ber that the Committee is here to help you in any way  we can through all phases of your home improvement  projects.      8   The GRIT – June 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 6    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  19 Cedar Hill Road – Reroof with Tesla Solar Roofing  30 Juniper Hill Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation   309 Big Horn Ridge – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  352 White Oaks Drive – New Construction  420 Live Oak Court – Replace Windows/Sliding Doors  and Restucco  506 Black Bear Loop – Restucco and Install Cantera  Stone Trim Around Windows  547 Black Bear Loop – Shade Structure Installation  925 Tramway Lane – Addition of Windows  1025 Tramway Lane – Replace windows w/ one window  1134 Marigold Drive – Landscaping   1165 Laurel Loop – Reroof   1215 Rockrose Road – Reseal and Install Bricks in Drive- way, Replace Railroad Ties in Patio with Pavers and  Paint/Stain Front Door   1422 San Rafael Avenue – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  1453 Honeysuckle Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  1572 Eagle Ridge Court – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation   1806 Tramway Terrace Loop – Install Screen Door,  Courtyard Gate, Gravel in Back Yard, Replace Windows   1829 Tramway Terrace Loop – Landscaping   1921 Quail Run Drive – Repaint Areas of House and   Garage Door  2440 Tramway Terrace Court – Gazebo Installation  2451 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence Replacement   2777 Wolfberry Place – Repair and Paint Stucco  2819Tramway Circle – Fence Replacement  2897 Tramway Place – Repaint Garage Door, Canales  and Wood Accents  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.     Hummingbirds  By Susan McCasland, GRIT editor    I think we all love to see hummingbirds in our yards.  New Mexico is blessed with 17 species of these tiny  dynamos, but there are four you are most likely to  see in Sandia Heights.  The first arrivals are the Black-chinned and Broad- tailed Hummingbirds. The Black-chinned males have  greenish backs and black chins and throats; females  have a green back and grey chest and belly. The  Broad-tailed males have a bright pink throat and fe- males have a dark-spotted throat. Also, the Broad- tailed hummers are loud when they fly—it sounds  like they’re screeching!   Around the Fourth of July the Rufous Humming- birds start arriving. These are the easiest to spot.  Both males and females have rust-colored feathers.  In addition, the males have bright orange throat  patches. They are also quite aggressive defending  feeding territories. Last in, towards late July or Au- gust, is the tiny Calliope Hummingbird. Males have  red streaks on their throats and generally green  backs. The females have green backs and an off- white chest and belly.  There are many flowers you can plant to attract  hummingbirds. You can also set up a feeder, though  be aware that bears also like hummingbird food, so  bring your feeders in at night. It is easy to make your  own hummingbird food. Simply mix 3 to 4 parts wa- ter to one part white granulated sugar. Heat it  slightly in the microware and stir so that the sugar  goes into solution. DO NOT USE RED FOOD COLOR- ING as this can be harmful to the hummers. The red  on the feeder is sufficient to attract them. Thor- oughly clean the feeder once a week or so.  Fun facts: a hummer’s heartrate is around 1200  beats per minute and they take about 250 breaths  per minute! They are only found in the Western  Hemisphere. They are migratory and the ones we  see in our neighborhood mostly winter in Mexico  and Central America. The Rufous goes as far north  as Alaska and northern Canada to nest.      9 The GRIT - June 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 6 10 The GRIT - June 2020 - Volume 36 - No. 6 11   The GRIT – June 2020 – Volume 36 – No. 6    Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed.          Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per directions of the  Governor’s Office.  When the situation resolves we will again meet on the second Saturday of every other month, hopefully  starting in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including  the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides  the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there  are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner  group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
