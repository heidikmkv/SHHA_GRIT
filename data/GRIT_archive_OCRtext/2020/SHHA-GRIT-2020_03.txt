Expenses of $204,459.07 and  Other Expenses of $2,666.46, resulting in a Net Income  of $915.07.  As stated at the time the 2019 Budget was ap- proved, these are projections which may change dur- ing the year and have changed. The final financial re- ports show Gross Income of $215,848.26, Expenses of  $208,457.96 and Other Expenses of $1,115.46, resulting  in a Net Income of $6,274.84. The major diﬀerence  between budgeted and actual amounts were addi- tional revenues from The GRIT and Directory advertis- ing and Tram ticket sales but, in addition, all Committee  Chairs managed their budgets which resulted in cost  savings.  2020 Budget  After reviewing the proposed budget at its September  11, 2019, meeting, the Board approved the budget as  proposed by the Finance Committee. The Finance Com- mittee developed the budget based on the current and  projected reserves and the revenues needed to cover  the services needed by the property owners.  This allows for a reasonable targeted Net Income of  approximately $444.44.  Each year the income and expenses will be reviewed  to establish the best courses of action for the following  years.  Budgets are projections which may change as the  year progresses, so please go to the Finance tab on the  Board section of the SHHA website for current details.  Internal Reviews  Each year members of the Finance Committee review  the major financial procedures to ensure they are be- ing followed.  This past year, members reviewed payroll, Quick- Books, dues, petty cash, advertising, Tram passes,  health insurance and security.  While there were no major issues noted, several im- provements were identified, especially in the area of  security. Security processes were updated to reflect  changes required due to the amount of data being  backed up.  Based on the reviews, the required annual report  was prepared and submitted to the Executive Commit- tee for review and acceptance by the President.  Please see page 3 for the Actuals vs. Budget and Bal- ance Sheet numbers.

Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  Members: Bob Thomas (Chair), Bob Bower (ACC liai- son), Stephen Baca, Camille Belden, Judy Chreist, Joyce  Harkwell, Stan Davis, Randy Tripp. Joyce, Camille, Stan,  and Randy joined the Committee. George Connor, Ruth  Haas, and Susan Seligman resigned.  Functions:  Sandia Heights has Use Restrictions (Covenants) gov- erned by over 38 sets of Covenants, each applying to a  designated Unit within the community. The CSC works  with property owners to enforce these legally binding  documents. CSC enforces covenants through a formal- ized process.  Many of the covenants were written in the 1960– 1970 timeframe and do not specifically address some  of the issues we face today. For some complaints, the  unit covenants do not cover the alleged violation and  there is nothing the CSC can do to help. We are bound  by what your covenants permit. Only the homeowners  in a specific unit can change their covenants.  The CSC meets the first Tuesday of every month at  7:00 PM in the office conference room. Homeowners  with questions or statement to make to the Committee  are allotted five minutes at the beginning of the meet- ing. Then the doors are closed to maintain the confiden- tiality of CSC business. Please notify the SHHA Office in  advance. CSC Agenda and Minutes are internal use only.

All were investigated by  CSC members and recommendations were made as to  the validity of the complaints with regard to the cove- nants relevant to their units. Of these, 21 closed in 2019.  2019 Successes: All complaints to CSC were thoroughly  investigated. Only one needed intervention by the SHHA  attorney. In some situations, BernCo Zoning Codes and  Ordinances are more restrictive than the SHHA cove- nants, such as outdoor lighting. Additionally, sometimes  the Codes and Ordinances cover a specific problem that  is not prohibited by the SHHA covenants, such as barking  dogs. In these instances, we encourage the homeowner  to file a complaint with the County. In 2018 and 2019 the  CSC has reached out to BernCo Zoning and we have de- veloped a great working relationship, resulting in the  successful resolution of several complaints.  Parks & Safety Committee (P & S)  Members: Travis Rich (Chair), Emily Rudin, Martin Kirk,  Roger Hagengruber, Barb Kelly, Burt O’Neil, Ron Vigil,  Cheryl Wieker, Bill Wiley  Summary of Activities for 2019:  • SHHA has adopted the section of Tramway Blvd  between Paseo del Norte and Simms Park Road.  We committed to clean this area 2x per year. This  year it was done in March and October. If you’re  curious, we average 1½ 40-gallon trash bags per  cleanup. The next “cleanup detail” will be March  21, 2020. You are invited to join the effort.  • March 19–21, 2019, were the dates of another suc- cessful effort to provide education to SHHA mem- bership regarding “Fire Risk Management.”  • There were 11 articles published in The GRIT during  2019 that pertained to the challenges of our com- munity. Fire risk was most prominent (6 articles);  security and crime were next (3 articles).   • Two GRIT articles (February, July) were about an  SHHA-sponsored demonstration project using  goats to remove excessive flammable organic ma- terial, thus lessening wildfire risk. The grazing goats  appeared to remove a portion of undergrowth and  that removal prevailed until the next growing sea- son. Goat-scaping is an alternative available to  homeowners who prefer a biological approach ra- ther than chemical or mechanical techniques.  Projects in the making:  Your association will be sponsoring a “Crime Risk  Management Seminar” on Saturday, March 14, 2020.  This will be a one-day event scheduled for 9:00 AM at  Church of the Good Shepherd. The purpose of the  seminar will be identifying things a resident may do to  help lower the risk of becoming a victim.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We meet on the second Saturday of every other month, starting  in September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including  the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The  host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal –  along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though  most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and  an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples  from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula  Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
