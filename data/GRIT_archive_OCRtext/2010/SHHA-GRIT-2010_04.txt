    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                     April 2010    President’s Message   ~ Andy Anderson       Our recent Meet ‘n’ Greet featured a  presentation by Dr. Mark DiMenna,  Environmental Health Manager Vector  Biologist with the City of Albuquerque  Environmental Health Department. Dr.  DiMenna is with the Vector-Borne and  Zoonotic Disease Division. Given the  elaborate title, he is in essence in charge of  the City/County organization that is  responsible for keeping the community free  from diseases transmitted to humans from  insects and animals. Although the division  resides within the City of Albuquerque  structure, they also serve all of Bernalillo  County as well.          His discussion was very insightful for  those who attended and the bottom line for  Sandia Heights was that we live in an area  susceptible to plague, hantavirus and  encephalitis. For Sandia Heights there is not  a problem with hantavirus or encephalitis,  however, we do need to be aware of and  alert for plague. The exposure to plague- infected animals and fleas increases as you  get further into housing developments in the  foothills of Sandia Mountains and in the  East Mountain area. Exposure can increase  during recreational activities, such as hiking  and camping.          Plague can be contracted if one is bitten  by infected rodent fleas and/or handles  plague-infected tissues of sick or dead  animals. Domestic cats can also contract  plague and transmit it to humans. In addition  to cats, dogs may carry plague-infected fleas  into the home. If you encounter any dead  animals near your property, please call 311  to report the sighting and ask for the  Environmental Health Department to come  out to remove the animal and test it for  plague.       Additionally, if you note any animals that  appear to be rabid or sickly, report them and  the department will respond.  You can also  call Dr. DiMenna and his task force at 505- 452-5301 or he can be reached personally on  his mobile line at 505-263-3299. The goal of  his organization is to keep the City, County  and Sandia Heights healthy and happy and  free from animal-borne diseases.    KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK    Spring Landscape Maintenance   by Margo Murdock       Spring is the time of year when I do about  95% of my landscape maintenance. It’s not  by choice. I’d spread it over the year if I  could it is just that spring is the best time for  the plants. I’ve enjoyed the seed heads over  the winter; have left the dry stalks standing  so the base and roots are protected, and  retained my lavender wands on the plant to  help keep snow from sitting on the foliage.  But it is spring and I have to think about  what needs to be done and in what order to  do it. Pruning sends a signal to the plant that  it needs to put out new stems or branches to  replace what’s been cut. For more  information about what and how to prune  visit the Sandia Heights Homeowners  website at  www.sandiahomeowners.org  and go to the news and  information page.  The GRIT, Apr 2010                                                                                                               Page 2                  Odds & Ends from Parks &  Safety Committee    By Larry & Frances Desonier       By now everyone should have heard about  the break-ins and mail theft in Sandia  Heights.  That being the case everyone  should be vigilant of any activity around  your neighborhood that looks suspicious.   Do you ever wonder what might be on line  that shows the crime in our neighborhood  and all over Albuquerque?  If you want to  see what is happening go to  www.crimereports.com  then enter  “Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87122” to get a  map of Sandia Heights and surrounding  neighborhoods.  You’ll see where autos  have been stolen, houses broken into, and  any assaults.  There are many other types of  crimes that are also reported.       Being that we are still in winter or early  spring there isn’t much or any vegetation  growth along our streets.  However, with  spring coming we will see a lot of growth.   If there are any street edges that need  trimming please let us know at SHHA so  that we can consolidate areas into a list and  give this to the county for maintenance.       Also please, please, please follow the  safety reminders below.       Pedestrian Safety Reminders  • Walk Facing Traffic; make eye  contact with drivers approaching  you.  • Wear reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening.   • If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.  • Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single  file.    Safety Vests for sale  in the SHHA office.  $2 per vest for  members and $4 per  vest for non-members.                    BYLAWS COMMITTEE       In anticipation of the annual meeting,  members are invited to submit amendments  to the bylaws.

Eighty-nine percent of our residents have  stated that they were either very or somewhat  concerned with undue obstruction of views by  trees* Now is the time to act on our convictions  and do our part to curtail, reduce, and reverse the  otherwise relentless advance of trees into our  distant mountain and valley views. The SHHA  Tree Lottery now provides a excellent chance  for all Association Members to have all or part   of their tree removal costs paid for by the  Association!        This winter has been particularly cold and  snowy. Trees in the clutches of winter cold,  winds, and drought appear dormant with no  apparent growth. But under the ground, their  roots continue to explore for new sources of  water and nutrients, thus preparing for the burst  of renewed growth which comes with spring.  Once again, our larger tree species will resume  their slow but deliberate assault on our valley  and mountain views!        The CS&MC urges you to take action now.  Are any of your trees interfering with your  enjoyment of Sandia Mountain or the Rio  Grande Valley? Are they interfering with the  views of your neighbors? If the answer is yes,  the time for action is now. Plan to have them  removed before the SHHA Annual Meeting in  June 2010 and enter the Lottery for a chance to  have the cost reimbursed.    Lottery Rules  • Must be a member of the SHHA   • Trees must have been cut and removed after  January 1, 2010  • Any size Siberian Elm** may be entered  (including young sprouts)  • Siberian Elm** stumps must be treated to  prevent re-growth  • Trees of all species over 26 feet high are  eligible  • Trees on County rights-of-way  are eligible  • Only Tree Owner can give permission  for tree removal    To Apply  • Fill out a Lottery application at the SHHA  Office  • Provide a paid copy of the invoice for tree  removal    Winners  • Drawings will follow the SHHA Annual  Meeting in June 2010  • Need not be present to win  •  Winners will receive actual cost of removal  up to a maximum of $750.00 per tree  • Drawings will continue until a total of  $5,000.00 has been awarded         Please see the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or drop by the SHHA  office for complete Lottery eligibility, entry, and  rules.
