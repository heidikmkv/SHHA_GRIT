We easily  had a quorum and we were able to conduct  our annual meeting and accomplish the items  of business we needed to perform. I am sure  you also noticed your SHHA Board of  Directors and volunteers working hard to  provide you with a meaningful and  professional meeting, with great snacks and  hot coffee this year. All went very smoothly,  and again thanks to all of the volunteers who  had to come early and stayed late for setup  and tear down to ensure we had a  professional and effective annual meeting.  Again, thank you.       The Town Hall meeting also went very  well, and the following issues and concerns  were elevated to our attention for action:    • Limit of who can report violations to  the SHHA  • Flood plain issue  • Tree issue at corner of Bobcat and  Tramway Lane  • Vendors along state highway  • Chinese/Siberian Elms  • Lack of volunteers for Wildflower  Club       These topics were assigned to the  appropriate individual and/or committee at  our 14 July board meeting. At this writing,  half the actions are already being worked  prior to our board meeting.         For those who were not able to attend, I  would like to take this opportunity to  introduce you to your new officers and Board  of Directors for 2010-2011. Your new Vice  President is Kate Fry, who joined the board a  year ago and has been very active with the  Architectural Control Committee and has  served on the Finance Committee. Michele  Munson is our new secretary. Michele too  joined the board a year ago and has been  serving on the Architectural Control and  Covenant Support Committees. Ed Tull has  done an excellent job as Treasurer last year  and has agreed to continue to serve as your  Treasurer this year as well. Ed also serves as  the chair of the Finance Committee. We have  two board members: our past president, Andy  Anderson, and Pete Heinstein, past chair of  the Architectural Control Committee, who  have agreed to continue to serve on the board  in different roles.    Other board members who will also  continue to fulfill their terms are: Bob Bower,  ACC Chair; Dick Wavrik, CSC Chair; Mike  Winokur, CS&M Chair; and Burt O’Neil,  Communications & Publications Chair.   Other continuing directors are Phil Abshere  and Bruce Childs.  We have five board members who have  fulfilled their terms ending at our annual  meeting. They are:  Marsha Thole, Jim  Irving, Frances and Larry Desonier, and  Mona Lee Schilling. Again, we want thank  each of them for their dedicated service to our  SHHA Board as well as to our Sandia  Heights community.    We also want to welcome four new board  members who were confirmed at our annual  meeting, and three who were voted on at the  July board meeting. They are already  jumping in with both feet to serve. They are:   Ana Acosta, Sandra Brown, George  Connor, Sarah Pirkl, Jon Cashwell, Joe Pappe  and Michael Pierce.

We still could  use additional volunteers for our respective  committees. At our July board meeting we  conducted our first orientation session with  all new board members. They got their  Director’s Manuals and learned about the  respective committees, with the intent to  help them become familiar with the  organization so they better know how and  where they might want to serve.  All of this would be nearly impossible to  juggle if it were not for our dedicated and  professional office staff, Sheraz Saint-Lôt  and Betsy Rodriguez, who keep us operating  like a high performing system. They are  there Monday through Friday (9-4pm) to  assist in any way they can (for example,  Tram passes, notary service, and copying  service for SHHA members) and to answer  your questions. I strongly recommend you  call upon them as needed. They want to help  and will cheerfully help you if they know  your need or concern. So please just ask.    They also keep me informed and if you  need to talk with me just let them know. I  will get in touch with you if you have a  question or an issue and concern that you  want to discuss. You can reach me by phone  at 828-1639 or by email  pamoore367@msn.com.                    Did you know one of our  Sandia Heights residents was  honored recently?    On Tuesday, 29 June Senator Harrison  H. Schmitt, a former Astronaut on Apollo 17  to the moon was honored by the Bernalillo  County Board of Commissioners and  District 4 Commissioner, Michael Wiener.  The renaming ceremony was conducted at  the Big Sky Hang Glider Park on Wilshire  Avenue, NE.  Commissioners Lucero and  Wiener and the honored guest, Senator  Schmitt all spoke at the ceremony. The new  name of the park on Wilshire Avenue will  now be:  Senator Harrison H. Schmitt Big  Sky Hang Glider Park. The SHHA President  was invited and attended the ceremony.                  Street Right of Way  Maintenance               The County right of way usually extends  a few feet beyond the paved edge of the  street into Sandia Heights properties. Each  of us is responsible for maintaining our part  of the right of way. Please be reminded  about the dangers of thick vegetation along  driveways and consider cutting thick  vegetation away from the entrance/exit of  your driveways so that both you and  oncoming cars and pedestrians have better  visibility.       As you know, the County has been  working closely with SHHA to cut along all  roadsides at a 45-degree angle in order to  help improve visibility. This has helped a  great deal, but it does not solve all problems  for pedestrians or drivers. We want to  encourage each of you to call the SHHA  office if you note specific areas where either  the chamisa is too overgrown or perhaps  signs are being blocked by trees and  vegetation at intersections. (The County  prefers to have one contact with SHHA for  reporting such nuisance areas.)       If you have a Siberian elm growing in the                          County right of way of your property, please  call the County directly at 848-1503. They  will remove the tree and treat it with Garlon  to prevent regrowth. (In this case, the  County requires the homeowner to make the  request directly to them, rather than by way  of the SHHA, to be sure that the homeowner  wants the tree removed.)                 The GRIT, Aug 2010                                                                                                            Page 3              The Sandia Heights  Coffeehouse Concert Series   will present a spirited evening of bluegrass  with Steve Smith and Chris Sanders on Sat.,  Sept. 18.

We cannot make your  reservations over the phone but you can call  the office and find out if passes are available  for the date you want. Once you bring your  $5 deposit per pass (cash or check only) we  will issue you an authorization letter stating  the number of passes and the specific date  you are going on the Tram.        Once this authorization letter is issued  you may NOT change the date. If you do not  use the authorization letter you will lose  your deposit. We will ONLY reimburse you  if the Tram is closed. You have thirty days  from the time you ride the Tram to come  back to the office with all of your Tram  ticket stubs to get a refund of your deposit.  If you are unable to come to the office  during our normal business hours you may  mail us the stubs or deposit them in the  wooden drop box that is standing next to the  front entrance of the office and we will mail  you a refund check.

While a written  and signed complaint is still required, you are  no longer asked or urged to “work it out” first  with your neighbor before filing the  complaint. With this change comes  clarification as to who can file a complaint.  Since the covenants exist for the specific Unit  the complainant needs to be part of that Unit  or directly affected by a violation (an  exception exists for major structural violations  handled by the ACC). The guidelines for who  can file a complaint are:  1. Must be a member of SHHA. If not a  member they must sign up and agree to  maintain membership for 1 year (unless  otherwise specified in By-Laws).  2. The complainant must be a property owner  in the same Unit, in direct line of sight of  the violation, or in an adjacent Unit for  which the violation is in close proximity to  the complainant. [The CSC reserves the  right to decline to act on complaints in  adjacent Units if the Complainant is not in  close proximity to the violation].  3. The BOD or SHHA members may file  complaints only on a significant violation  in progress regardless of the Unit in which  they occur. A significant violation is  defined as major architectural changes,  remodels, re-roof, major landscaping, etc.,  that if not acted upon immediately would  result in a major impact to the home owner  or Unit.  [Note: this type of violation  would generally be referred to the ACC].   If non-significant violations (trailers,  RV’s,  trim colors, etc.), which are easily  correctable, are submitted by the BOD or  SHHA members that are not in the same  Unit, in line of sight, or directly affected  by the violation, as defined in Paragraph 2,  will be rejected by the CSC.  4. The CSC, Architectural Control  Committee (ACC), and Board of Directors  has maintained a no-patrolling policy and  a non-selective enforcement policy.    If you suspect a violation, and meet the  criteria in Paragraph 2, please fill out a  complaint form (see SHHA web site or visit  the SHHA office).    ALL UNIT COVENANTS PROHIBIT THE  PARKING OF RV’S, CAMPING  TRAILERS, HOUSE TRAILERS, BOATS,  ETC ON THE PROPERTY. If these exist in  your Unit or you are directly affected (see  Paragraph 2 above) please file a complaint.  You do NOT have to confront the violator.                 SHHA Tree Lottery Results    Congratulations to this year’s Tree  Lottery Winners:  Patrice Franklin-Henden - $240.18      Bill Waters - $625.03  Burt O’Neil - $533.12         Jo Fairbanks - $478.48                         Michelle Runyan - $750.00                     Hollis J.

Solar collectors include any of a  wide range of devices designed to convert  solar radiation into heated gases, liquids, or  electricity.  Over the last year or so, the  ACC has seen an increase in requests for  installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems  which are solar collectors uniquely designed  to produce electrical energy.  This article  will be limited to a discussion of PV systems  for residential use.       So, let’s talk about the installation of a  PV system for your home. The best way to  start is to estimate your annual requirement  for electrical power. You can go to the PNM  website and get this information. It is  available for the last 13 months and is  expressed in terms of kilowatt hours (kWh).   Once you know about how much energy you  use annually, you can size a PV system to  generate all or a portion of this demand. A  good rule of thumb is that here in New  Mexico, a one kilowatt PV system generates  about 1800 kWh of electrical power per  year. This figure is based on the average  number of sunny hours per year that we  have. As an example, if you have a medium- sized home where your annual energy  consumption is about 10,000 kWh, you will  need a PV system sized to produce about 5.5  kilowatts (5,500 watts). Most PV panels  come in a variety of sizes but let’s assume  that you purchase an array of panels that  generates about 200 watts per panel after  consideration of losses associated with the  conversion of DC power produced by the  panels to AC power available for your use  and other losses associated with these types  of systems. This figure of 200 watts of  usable AC power per panel is close to the  average output power rating of most PV  systems that we have seen installed over the  last year or so here in Sandia Heights. This  means that you will need an array consisting  of just under 30 panels (27.5 to be exact) to  produce 5,500 watts which, in turn, will  meet your annual need of 10,000 kWh of  electrical power.       Obviously, there’s much more to the  installation of a good PV system than can be  discussed in this article, and a  knowledgeable contractor will help answer  your questions. The ACC encourages the  installation of PV panels to help conserve  energy that you would otherwise use from  non-solar sources. Keep in mind, however,  that the ACC is very concerned about the  potential annoyance of these panels to your  immediate neighbors and, as such, only  allows installations with features such as  pitch angles, heights, and anti-glare features  that reduce or eliminate any negative visual  impacts on those neighbors. The ACC  design guideline for solar collectors was  established to ensure that solar collectors are  in compliance with your unit covenants and  do not produce any objectionable effects on  neighboring residences. Keep in mind that in  addition to aesthetic reasons, there are  technical reasons (i.e. shading) for locating  solar panels some distance away from  parapets. The guideline contains a sample  illustration specifically designed for the  installation of PV panels. When submitting  an application for installation of a PV  system for your residence, be sure to include  the information requested in the guideline.              The GRIT, Aug 2010                                                                                                         Page 8              ACC Activity Log     The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.    15 Sandia Heights Drive – Replace Gutters.

Sandia Heights Artists News… Hang in there! The wait is almost over –  the spectacular, scintillating, sizzling Sandia Heights Art Tour is scheduled for  September 25 and 26, the last weekend in September. You’ll see beautiful art for  purchase created for you by your Sandia Heights friends and neighbors. See  examples of our work at www.sandiaheightsart.com    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity  This fall represents the sixth year of our Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” couples dining  activity. We meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our members. Each small  group consists, typically, of three couples plus a host couple, with each couple  contributing to some part of the dinner menu. By “couple” here, we mean any twosome  that makes sense! The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Our 2010  - 2011 season kicks off on Saturday, September 11 with a get-acquainted cocktail  party. We’re always looking for new couples to join us, so if this sounds like an activity  that might appeal to you, please call or e-mail Larry Anderson (821-3158;  andersnm@aol.com) for more information.
