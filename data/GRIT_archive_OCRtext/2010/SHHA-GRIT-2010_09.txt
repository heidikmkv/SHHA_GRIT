    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           September 2010                  President’s Message by   Phyllis Moore       Well, here we are emptying our rain  gauges, having our windows washed  naturally, and enjoying cooler temperatures  for a while until the kids return to school.  However, the yellow buses will be rolling  again soon, and we need to be aware of  children out near our roads and again watch  our speed as all of this will begin even  before you receive this GRIT message.            Since our annual meeting in June your  President and Vice President and Treasurer  have met with key personnel regarding the  services needed and provided, in order to  keep our community effectively working  every day. We have met with Dave  Mitchell, Director of Operations and  Maintenance for Bernalillo County,  regarding our roads and streets and the  services the department provides. After all  the rain, I have already observed the street  sweeper out and about, trying to clean up  all the loose gravel and sand as result of our  recent downpours.         This time of year also has produced some  bear sightings. We have sent out one e-mail  alert so far regarding bear sightings in the  Juniper Hill area. If you are not on our e- mail alert roster, you may want to call our  SHHA office and sign up. Again, if you  have a need to talk with someone about  bear activity, please contact our Bear Watch  Sandia Heights Wildlife Steward, Kate Fry.  You can call Kate at 828-9618 or Bear  Watch (Jan Hayes, 281-9282) at any time if  you have questions regarding bear activity  and sightings.       Also I am pleased to report that all six  issues that surfaced during our Town Hall  meeting in June have been addressed and/or  researched with the appropriate agency or  department. Topics were identified in my  August GRIT message. The one regarding  vendors on Tramway Blvd will have to be  dealt with when caught in action this  fall/winter, but we now know who to  contact if this reoccurs.            With summer activities behind us we  have two events in September that I  strongly recommend you support and  attend. Your Association will sponsor  another Sandia Heights Coffeehouse  Concert at Church of the Good Shepherd on  18 September.  Specific details were on  page 3 of our August GRIT and are on page  3 in this September GRIT. We know we  have gained new residents over the summer  and we want to cordially invite them and all  of SHHA residents to attend our next  SHHA-hosted Meet and Greet on Saturday,  25 September.   Stop by and meet our new  Board members and volunteers. They have  been busy since our annual meeting getting  integrated and  established with their  chosen committees.   Again, all of us are  working to protect and  preserve our unique,  natural community.   The GRIT, Sep 2010                                                                                                            Page 2                Motorcycle Noise on Tramway       If a Sandia Heights resident is having  trouble with excessive motorcycle noise on  Tramway Blvd. or any other road in Sandia  Heights, call the BC Sheriff and Fire Dept.  non-emergency number at 798-7000. Tell  the person that answers the call that you  want to report a non-emergency. Briefly  describe the problem and location where it  occurred. Give the person your name,  telephone #, and address, and request to be  contacted by the sheriff deputy after they  check out this problem. The last step is very  important in case the deputy sent to check  on the problem arrives after the problem has  gone away. By requesting that you be  “contacted” the deputy insures that the  incident will be “officially recorded” as an  actual incident when the deputy was too late  to catch the offender(s). Correctly  identifying the deputy’s trip to Sandia  Heights in “official reports” as a failure to  catch the offender motorcyclists can lead to  more proactive BC Sheriff patrols in Sandia  Heights and on Tramway Blvd.                    BEAR  SIGHTINGS:       There have been possible  bear sightings in Sandia  Heights. Bear sightings  should be called in to NM Game and Fish at  either 222-4700 or 222-4719. The call will  be logged and NMG&F will determine the  appropriate action to be taken, which may be  trapping and relocating.    If the bear is  threatening persons or pets , please call the  emergency number. That number is (505)  827-9372. This number should be called  ONLY if a bear is actively threatening  persons or pets.     Also, remove any ripe fruit from trees,  bring bird feeders (including hummingbird  feeders) and pet food inside at night and do  not leave your trash out. Problem bears  become problems because people make food  available!                  Help Eliminate Roadside Elm  Trees       We’ve all seen the elm trees and saplings  that seem to thrive along the edges of our  roads. We certainly do not want them there,  but that is where the rainwater drains. We  need to be vigilant about removing them to  keep the natural foothills vegetation look  that we love about Sandia Heights.      The Bernalillo County Code requires that  we homeowners trim dead vegetation, clear  weeds, and maintain the natural landscaping  in our easement areas (the part between the  edge of the road and the property line within  the public right of way). This includes  removing those rogue elm saplings from the  entire easement area. It is much easier to do  this when the elms are very small, as they  quickly grow deep roots. The County will do  their usual mowing of the first few feet on  either side of the road, but we all know that  simply cutting off an elm sapling only  stimulates it to grow into a thicket.      The only way to permanently remove an  elm tree or sapling is to dig it out. If  property owners are having a hard time with  elms that have gotten too big for them to  handle, they may call 848-1503 for only the  trees in front of their homes (not their  neighbors’) and make a work order request  directly to the County Road Supervisor.  He  will help out as best he can for trees in the  right of way on an individual request basis.                    The GRIT, Sep 2010                                                                                                            Page 3  TRAM PASSES    SHHA has purchased 6 corporate tram  passes per day!

If you eventually want to replace  the entire roof, then you will need to submit  another application so the ACC can review  your proposal for the new roof.      In addition to roof repairs and new roofs,  remember that you must submit an application  to the ACC for any project that changes the  external appearance of your residence. Some  examples are the addition of a new room,  installation of solar panels, restuccoing,  replacing doors or windows, painting trim, and  landscaping. Correcting after-the-fact changes  to your property causes aggravation and is  often expensive. Save yourself the hassle of  this kind of situation by applying to the ACC  for approval before you undertake a project!     In emergency situations such as repair of  broken or clogged water or sewer lines, repair  or replacement of septic systems, or other  situations where the urgency of the situation  requires quick action in order to minimize  property damage and inconvenience to the  homeowner, the ACC does not want to stand  in your way.  If a situation like this arises, just  let the SHHA office know that you will be  tending to an emergency situation and, if  applicable, that heavy equipment for  excavations may be required. This information  will help the office answer questions from  your neighbors who may be inquiring about  what is going on at your home.                  Covenant Support Committee      Sandia Heights comprises 37 units, each  of which has its own set of covenants.
