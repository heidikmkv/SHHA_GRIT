Roadrunner Holiday Food  Drive     Be a part of taking action this holiday  season and get involved in our food drive!  The Holidays can be difficult for many New  Mexicans with more than 20% of the  population living in poverty. Food drives  enable the food bank to provide a wide  variety of high quality, nutritious food items  throughout the year. The Roadrunner Food  Bank of New Mexico distributes more than  22 million pounds of food a year to hundreds  of nonprofit agencies throughout New  Mexico. Each one of us can make an impact.   Please help by bringing non-perishable food  items to the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association office located at San Rafael and  Tramway. Office hours are Monday through  Friday 9am-4pm. Look for the big red drop  box inside.    Most Needed Items:  Macaroni & Cheese, Canned Fruits, Canned  Vegetables, Canned Meats, Canned Entrees,  Cereal Bars, Rice, Sugar, Pastas, Soups, Baby  Food, Boxed Meals. Plastic, boxed, bagged  and canned containers present less chance of  breakage and less loss of good food.     MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR  YOUR GENEROSITY.!

Firstly, we got several interested residents to  serve on the ad hoc committee we organized  to address the waste water and septic tank  issue and concerns presented to our  community at our last Meet and Greet on  September 25th. This committee’s purpose  will be to address possible solutions and  alternatives while working with our county  and, in turn, meeting the imposed  requirements. If you were not able to attend  the Meet and Greet regarding this subject, the  County presentation is available at our  webpage. I am pleased to inform you that Bob  Francis will be chairing this committee. In fact  the committee has already met and started  their research by the time you are reading this  article. Again, a special thanks to Bob for  spearheading this effort and to each resident  serving with him on this committee. It truly  takes all of us working together to improve  and preserve our natural setting. Also I want  to extend a big thank you to Pete Heinstein for  the planning and executing the kickoff  meeting. We have a great group of interested  residents!      Secondly, we have learned about a potential  proposed change to a county ordinance for  amplified sound introduced by our 4th District  Commission, Michael Wiener. We have  notified by mail Units 6, 7, 7CC, 27, 28 and  Sandia Heights north 1, 2, 3 of the planned  hearing on Tuesday, 14 December at 5pm so  interested residents can attend. Also an article  about this proposed ordinance change appears  in this GRIT edition as well.       Thirdly, and maybe the most important to  our young residents, we have planned a Meet  and Greet with Santa on December 11th at our  SHHA office. Hopefully you have made your  reservation or have plans to do so? This is just  a sample of all the efforts behind the scenes  that are working to enhance and promote our  community. I am so pleased we are trying  different ways to build community within our  neighborhood, and we recognize that our  demographics are changing.     With my position, I hear from many of you  and I enjoy hearing what is on your minds.   However, one phone call did disturb me when  I learned of a resident needing help regarding  a fall and residents just kept walking. The fall  was the result of a dog not being on a leash  which is a requirement within our community.  My hope is that we are kind and helpful to our  neighbors, and when you see an emergency or  a need that we do pitch in and help out  quickly.         Lastly by the time you read this we will be  in the Holiday Season and all of us at the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  hope you have had a good year and are  looking forward to 2011.

If  approved, permitted amplified sound levels  would be increased from 45 decibels to 75 db  in commercial zoned areas. In addition to the  increased sound level, the proposed duration  would also increase to allow concerts up to  three times per week for three hour periods  ending at 9:30 pm. These changes would  allow restaurants such as the County Line,  which is zoned commercial, to expand their  outdoor music concerts which might affect  your neighborhood.        The Bernalillo County Commissioners will  vote on this proposal on Tuesday, December  14 at 5:00 pm. SHHA is requesting a 30 to 60  day deferral. The address of the City/County  Government Building is 1 Civic Plaza. There  is underground parking available. The  commissioners meet in the Griego Chambers  in the basement. There will be public input at  that time.

All our residents, SHHA members and  non-members, receive the monthly GRIT  newsletter in the mail. Some of our residents  ignore the mailed GRIT and only read the  GRIT online. The online GRIT is in color and  in the near future will incorporate audio and  video to supplement our printed articles.    While there is NO intention of  discontinuing the printed mailed out version of  the GRIT, some of our residents want to have  the online GRIT and cancel the mailed printed  version. This is consistent with the trend to  reduce the harvesting of trees for paper and to  avoid the unnecessary cost of inks, printing  and postage.      If you do decide to cancel your mailed  GRIT, an adult household member need only  email the SHHA office at  sandiaheights@comcast.net with your name  and address and request to be taken off of the  GRIT mailing list. Any time you wish to  return to receiving the printed mailed GRIT,  you may do so, again via an email requesting  to be added to the mailing list.                   MAIL THEFT        Mail theft is a  continuing problem! We  advise that you take your  outgoing mail to the Post  Office. If the option is  available it might be best  to have sensitive information like checks,  insurance and mortgage papers sent to your  bank branch and you can pick them up from  there, rather than having them sent to your  house. Likewise, consider opening a post  office box and have your mail sent there.  Otherwise, keep your eye out for the postman  and get your mail out of your box quickly.      The MO of the perpetrators has been early  mornings, when folks are out walking. Please  be alert to anyone in a vehicle checking  mailboxes. A license number on a vehicle  along with a vehicle description would go a  long way to putting an end to this activity.       If you experience mail theft, notify the  BCSO (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1- 877-876-2455), and Sandia Heights Security  (856-6347 and 263-4654). If you witness a  crime in progress notify BCSO and Security.

In several weeks the  treadmill of the season turns on, and we are  off and running, trying to get everything  checked off our ‘To Do' lists. That goes for  the CSC as well.     Our mission is to promote the common  welfare and interests of the homeowners,  property owners, and residents within  Sandia Heights. We do this by investigating  covenant violations reported by SHHA  members that reside within the units, and we  strive to assist homeowners resolve the  violations.     There are 37 units within Sandia Heights,  each with their own set of covenants. There  is little consistency from unit to unit except  for parking and storing RV's, boats and  camper/trailers. In all units this is a  violation, unless they are stored in a garage-- hidden, folks. Throwing a tarp over said  items does not count.     During the months when residents use  these items, you are allowed 2 days to load  and unload.  After that, you must find a  home for your toys off-site (or again, inside  your garage). You may NOT park said items  on the street or easements. Most streets in  Sandia Heights are owned by Bernalillo  County. They can and have sited  homeowners who are illegally parked.       The CSC has recently developed an  observation log to be filled out by the person  issuing the complaint. This log was  developed following advice from SHHA's  lawyer in case we have to go to court. CSC  members will also do periodic checks during  that time which will be recorded.  As over  half our members work full or part time,  they are unable to go by a property on a  daily basis.       We could all save ourselves time and  trouble by following the covenants  initially. To be clear these Declarations of  Restrictions or Covenants apply to everyone,  including renters. Let us be good neighbors  and do what is right.                  LIGHHTING ORDINANCE:        A number of our Sandia Heights  Homeowners have, over time, installed  flood lights and motion sensor lights on their  properties. Some of the Covenants state that  “no un-shaded flood lights shall be  maintained which cause light directly into  the homes of other residents in the  subdivision”. As a good neighbor, please  check and redirect your lights and/or shield  them downward to alleviate this problem.   Bernalillo County Code Chapter 30 –  Environment Article VI section 30-186 (1.)    All outdoor light fixtures and illuminated  on-premises signs shall be (1) designed and  operated as cutoff or shielded aimable  fixtures, (2) equipped with and controlled by  light and motion sensors or automatic timing  devices, and (3) shall remain off between  11:00 p.m. and sunrise except for  illuminating walkways or driveways.    Sec. 30-183. Intent and purpose.       This division is intended to create  standards for outdoor lighting so that its use  does not unreasonably interfere with the  enjoyment of adjacent property owners, and  with astronomical observations, and to  promote energy conservation without  jeopardizing safety, utility, security and  productivity. The purpose of this division is  to minimize light pollution, which has a 2  detrimental effect on the night sky  environment, interferes with the enjoyment  of the night sky, and causes unnecessary  illumination of adjacent properties.

It is a noteworthy article  and I think that the information is important  enough to pass on to the SHHA community.   I hope it is helpful.  Sincerely, Bob Bower,  Chairman, ACC.    Hire Licensed and Insured  Contractors! By Jessica Speck         Contracting without a license in the state  New Mexico is against the law. With  setbacks in our current economic conditions,  we are all cutting corners with our spending.   Many homeowners are choosing to remodel  their current homes as opposed to  purchasing new homes, which is wonderful.  But in order to save a little money, they are  choosing to hire inexperienced, unlicensed,  uninsured individuals often becoming a  sizeable liability to the homeowner and the  completed home project. While it seems  reasonable to spend less and find any cost  deals available, this approach has devastated  the home-remodeling industry.       Recently there has been a rise of  unlicensed individuals entering the home- remodeling market with a set of tools, a  truck and minor remodeling skills who have  begun delivering bids to the homeowner at  prices too good to be true!  Remember the  old adage:  “You get what you pay for”, it  still carries great validity, even in the home- remodeling industry.  Low-quality material  and workmanship often go unnoticed for  months or even years often times resulting  in the cost of demolition of the poor  workmanship and paying again for a  licensed contractor to build what the “Scope  of Work” actually called for.  Unfortunately  however, no insurance is one of the most  obvious and devastating ways construction  costs are cut.  This means that if anyone  should fall off the homeowner’s roof, use  faulty materials and methods, or damage the  homeowner’s home or belongings, there is  no coverage to protect the homeowner. In  these circumstances, the unlicensed or  uninsured remodeler cannot afford to pay for  the damages leaving the homeowner with an  uncompleted project and large mistakes to  pay for. This can be related to the liability  incurred when we get in a car accident with  an individual who has failed to purchase car  insurance. Who then pays for your personal  injuries or damages to your car and their  car? You or your insurance company will  then be responsible for the damages.
