We are in desperate need of volunteers and board members.

As a board member, she would work for the continued improvement  of our neighborhood as well as the safety of Sandia Heights.  George Connor has been a resident of Sandia Heights for 16 years and served one term on the  SHHA board 2000-2003. He has also been a volunteer the SHHA board a few times since leaving the  board in 2003.

Ana Acosta and her family moved to Sandia Heights from Portland, Oregon in June 2009. Although  she has only been a resident of Sandia Heights less than a year, she loves the area for its natural  beauty, peacefulness, and proximity to the mountains and of course the daily sun! Ana is excited to  be a member of the board and looks forward to being an advocate and representative of our  community. She is a stay-at-home mom with two young children (ages 1 and 5). She enjoys an array  of outdoor activities and finds this the place to be. Before being a stay-at-home Mom, she worked as  a consultant in the microenterprise/asset development field and holds an MA in Intercultural  Communications.                       BYLAWS COMMITTEE    The proposed amendments to the bylaws will be available on the website by May 18 or earlier.

This is to better  serve the needs of the public. While the County has a restrictive ordinance on open burning for  certain materials, covenants in Sandia Heights prohibit burning. They generally state: “No trash shall  be burned on the premises except in approved incinerators located indoors or within service yard. No  garbage shall be burned. Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said  containers to be concealed from public view by an attractive enclosure. No barbecue  or other outdoor cooking facility shall be located thereon nearer than ten feet from  either side of lot line unless made a part of the residence.” To check your covenants  you may look them up online at www.sandiahomeowners.org in the Covenants folder.

In  conjunction with the luncheon, nominations  would be accepted to award volunteers  whom had had a large positive impact on  SHHA and whom had demonstrated an  extraordinary amount of work and skill.  Drop by the SHHA office sometime and  study the wall plaque commemorating these  extraordinary volunteers.     SHHA held it’s Annual Volunteer  Recognition Luncheon at Sandiago’s at the  base of the tram on Saturday, April 10.  Thirty-two volunteers gave tribute to Jim  Irving, the Volunteer of the Year. Jim served  as a director on the SHHA board for 5 ½  years. During that time he worked on the  Covenant Support (CSC) and on the Bylaws  Committees.  Jim’s legal background  assisted the CSC in solving a number of  difficult complaints. During this same time,  he also functioned as a quasi assistant chair  on the Bylaws Committee.     Honorable Mentions were also given at the  annual 2010 volunteer luncheon to Kate Fry,  Bob Bower and Frances Desonier for their  years of service to SHHA. Kate and Bob  have been invaluable members on the ACC  for two years and were instrumental in  developing a measuring system for  determining the actual height of objects as  they relate to view obstruction. They have  also served as directors on the SHHA board  for the past year. Frances is finishing a three  year term as a director; she has served on the  Parks & Safety and on the Community  Services & Membership Committees.     Your organization is in desperate need of  new volunteers for the board and for its  various committees. Please seriously  consider offering your time and energy to  the service of your community by serving  SHHA as a director or as a volunteer on one  of the many committees.

In an effort  to "tighten our belts" the County  Commission enacted a Hiring Freeze that  began on February 1st. This will stay in  place until July 1st when we will re-assess  our currently “anemic” financial picture.  The Commission also just passed sweeping  new Ethics Legislation; holding elected  officials to an even higher standard of  conduct.  As you know, the Commission unanimously  appointed Manny Gonzales to be our new  Sheriff - succeeding and completing the  term of Darren White.  Sheriff Gonzales has  pledged to work even more closely with the  Commissioners, to respond to our concerns  and to address a number of the issues that  his predecessor was not responsive to.  The Commission also passed the first of my  MDC Enterprise Programs to have inmates  at the Metropolitan Detention Center sew  their own uniforms, mattress pads and other  textiles.  Soon this program will begin and  taxpayers will see significant annual  savings; while teaching inmates valuable  work skills.  Once this program is up and  running, I will introduce the next two  programs at MDC to have inmates raise  their own vegetables hydroponically and  establish a tilapia fish farm.  These and  many other programs exist throughout the  nation in county jails and have all proved  successful while saving millions of taxpayer  dollars.  In February, I, along with three of my fellow  commissioners, met in Washington, DC  with our U.S. Senators Bingaman and Udall  and with U.S. Representatives Lujan,  Teague and Heinrich to impress upon our  congressional delegation the importance of  our federal funding requests for $160  million in infrastructural improvements in  Bernalillo County.  I also lobbied our  Washington delegation for the need to re- build the Paseo Del Norte/I-25 interchange.   This enormous intersection improvement  will require $325 million in additional  funding to complete and will need to be  prioritized for it to become a reality.  I have established a Coalition of District 4  Neighborhood Associations (all of the  Presidents of the Neighborhood associations  throughout my district) as well as a District  4 Legislative Coalition (the 16 state    representatives and senators who share parts  of Commission District 4). We have had two  meetings thus far and plan another two hour  session on April 14th when we will discuss  the recently concluded Legislative session  and the CIP (Capital Improvement Program)  funding requests. This is a very valuable  opportunity for me to hear from our  neighborhood leaders and legislators and for  everyone to learn from one another and to  work more closely together.  There has been a slight delay in the  groundbreaking for the Eubank widening  project due to condemnation proceedings. A  neighborhood meeting is now being  scheduled for late May or early June to  announce the awarding of this contract and  then finally the construction on this $25  million/ 11 month project will commence.  Watch for announcements in the weeks  ahead as to the exact date for this  neighborhood meeting. You can track the  progress of the Eubank reconstruction  project on the <Bernco.gov> website.  It is my pleasure to represent you on the  Bernalillo County Commission. If I can  assist you in anyway, please feel free to  contact my assistant Darrell Dady at: 468- 7010. You can always email me  at:michaelw@bernco.gov or call me on my  cell phone at 688-0004.

All of the  Unit covenants prohibit these trailers on the  property or common areas. In the past  SHHA had several legal actions which  upheld the definition of a house trailer to  include RVs, camping trailers, etc. When  you moved to Sandia Heights you agreed to  abide by the covenants for your Unit. In  fairness to your neighbors please move your  toys to a storage facility.  The CSC does not patrol or selectively look  for violations but will act only on written  complaints from neighbors. Thus you may  see trailers that have been parked but no  written complaint has been filed while your  trailer has a complaint. Once a complaint is  filed it will be investigated and if valid you  will be asked to move the trailer. Failure to  comply can result in legal action.  This may sound harsh, but the CSC is  committed to maintaining the quality of  Sandia Heights while protecting each  homeowner’s rights as defined by their  covenants.            Tree Lottery News – Your Tree  Removed At No Cost to You?

We advise that you take your outgoing  mail to the Post Office. If the option is available it might be best to have  sensitive information like checks, insurance and mortgage papers sent to your  bank branch and you can pick them up from there, rather than having them  sent to your house. Likewise, consider opening a post office box and have  your mail sent there. Otherwise, keep your eye out for the postman and get your mail out of your  box quickly.                          Secure Mailboxes Available     The UPS Store located at the corner of Tramway & Academy has mail boxes available.
