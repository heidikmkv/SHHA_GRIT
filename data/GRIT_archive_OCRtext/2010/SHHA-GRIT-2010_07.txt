  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                               July 2010                President’s Message by   Phyllis Moore       As your new president, I would like to  express my thanks to all of you who  attended our SHHA Annual Meeting and  the Town Hall Meeting on June 12th. We  had a good turnout and accomplished  several objectives but most importantly we  kept you informed about our association  and what committees are working on  behind the scenes to improve our  community. All of our standing committees  were very busy this past year and your  SHHA Board of Directors  and volunteers  worked hard to provide you with an  authentic review of our association and a  professional meeting without any major  glitches.         Four new directors for the SHHA Board  of Directors were nominated and  confirmed. The BOD welcomes Ana  Acosta, Sandra Brown, George Connor and  Sarah Pirkl. We are also pleased to report  too that two nominees have agreed to stay  on for a second term. They include our past  president, Andy Anderson and our recent  Architectural Control Committee Chair,  Pete Heinstein. Your new officers are Kate  Fry as Vice President, Ed Tull as Treasurer,  and Michele Munson as Secretary--thanks  to all for volunteering. As we expressed at  our annual meeting, we are working with  lean committees. However, we do  anticipate additional new Board members to  be confirmed at our upcoming July Board  Meeting but we still need additional  volunteers for our established committees.   We are especially short on the Community  Service & Membership Committee,  Covenant Support Committee and  Communications & Publications  Committee. If you have a few hours to  spare and have an interest in serving on any  of the committees, I encourage you to  contact me or any current Board member or  call the office and volunteer. We need you.          If you have an area of concern, please  either contact us at the office (797-7793) or  email us at shha@sandiahomeowners.org,  or call me at 828-1639. We continue to  welcome your input and I look forward to  working with the Board, the committees,  the officers, and our residents to continue to  improve and maintain our unique  community.           The amended SHHA Bylaws that were  approved at the 2010 Annual Meeting are  now on the website.       SHHA wishes  everyone a safe and  happy Fourth of  July!    The Declaration of  Independence    We hold these truths to be self-evident,  that all men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Creator with  certain unalienable Rights,  that among these are Life, Liberty and the  pursuit of Happiness.  The GRIT, July 2010                                                                                                            Page 2                Did you know  that Bernalillo  County has a  noise ordinance?        For complaints regarding  noise, (e.g., from homes, cars, motorcycles,  restaurants and other businesses, etc.), you  can call the Environmental Health Office at   314-0310 and County Commissioner  Michael Wiener at 468-7010. For  car/motorcycle racing up and down  Tramway Blvd, also call the non-emergency  number for the Sheriff at 768-4160. Often,  when it is a neighbor who is causing the  noise, it helps to make a polite request to  that person to resolve the problem.        Subscribers to Sandia Heights Security  can call the mobile patrol to check loud  parties, but all other complaints need to go  to the Sheriff's Office or as noted  above. Barking dogs may also be handled by  animal control.                Architectural Control  Committee (ACC)       Are you planning a home improvement  project soon? If it will change the exterior  appearance of your property, you must submit  an application to the ACC.  Please make sure  that your application is completely filled out  and submitted in a timely manner so that the  Committee can do its job for you as quickly as  possible. An incomplete application will cause  unnecessary delays in the approval process.     It is important that you understand the  covenant restrictions applicable to your  property before you plan a project. As a first  step in planning your project, you need to read  your covenants and the applicable ACC design  guidelines. Both are available in hard copy at  the SHHA Office or on the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org. Most disapprovals by  the Committee could be avoided if these steps  were taken first.  In addition, the ACC is  willing to discuss the project with you before  you incur the expenses associated with a  detailed design.       The ACC processes between 300 and 400  applications per year. Approximately one-half  of these applications are to replace roofing,  windows and doors or to re-stucco. The ACC  usually processes these within a few days.  However, projects such as new house  construction and additions, walls and fences,  and landscaping sometimes take up to a month  to process after all the required information is  received. If your project is like one of these,  please take extra care to see that the ACC gets  the information it needs and that you will be  available to meet with an ACC volunteer to  walk your property and explain the project.  These projects usually require a plot plan that  shows the location of your house and project  relative to your property lines and are either  drawn to scale or carefully dimensioned. The  plot plan that you received with your deed is a  good starting point. The ACC cannot begin to  process your application until these steps are  completed.       Please do not ask the Committee to expedite  your application so your contractor “can start  your project next week.” The Committee  works very hard to handle your application in  a fair and professional manner and needs  adequate time to do its job. Starting a project  before you receive the written approval of the  ACC is a violation of your covenants and puts  you and your contractor at risk if the  Committee is unable to approve part or all of  your project. With a little advance planning  and the timely submittal of your application,  you can avoid these difficulties.     Remember, the ACC encourages you to  have the Committee look at your project in the  early planning stages to check for covenant  compliance. Please take advantage of this  service if you have any doubts so you can  avoid future problems. A little advance  planning will go a long way to assist you  through all phases of your project and to  enhance your ultimate enjoyment of it!               The GRIT, July 2010                                                                                                            Page 3              SHHA Membership Cards &  Merchant Benefit Program             Your SHHA member benefits and  services include: office and notary services,  annual classified ads, Coffeehouse Concert  Series, Sandia Tram Passes, covenant  enforcement, no-fee ACC applications, and  discounted safety vests.

We cannot make your reservations over  the phone but you can call the office and  find out if passes are available for the date  you want. Once you bring your $5 deposit  per pass (cash or check only) we will issue  you an authorization letter stating the  number of passes and the specific date you  are going on the Tram.      Once this letter is issued you may NOT  change the date. If you do not use the  authorization letter you will lose your  deposit. We will ONLY reimburse you if the  Tram is closed. You have thirty days from  the time you ride the Tram to come back to  the office with all of your Tram ticket stubs  to get a refund of your deposit. If you are  unable to come to the office during our  normal business hours you may mail us the  stubs or deposit them in the wooden drop  box that is standing next to the front  entrance of the office and we will mail you a  refund check.  Please note: After 5pm the $1  parking fee at the Tram terminal is waived.                  The Sandia Heights  Coffeehouse Concert Series   will present a spirited evening of bluegrass  with Steve Smith and Chris Sanders on  Sat., Sept. 18.

This is  also when the mama  bears kick out the two- year-olds, who then  have to find their own  territory. These young  bears often wander into our neighborhood  because they remember where they have  found easy food. Here’s what you can do to  keep bears from becoming habituated and  thus becoming problem bears:  ¾ Keep all garbage in your garage or a  sturdy shed.  ¾ Put garbage out only on the morning of  your trash pickup day.    ¾ Don’t leave pet food outside.  ¾ Bring hummingbird feeders inside at  dusk (and take them inside for the winter  in October).  ¾ Fill bird feeders with only enough seed  to last half the day (better yet, don’t feed  the birds at all for a while).  ¾ If you have fruit trees:  pick fruit as it  ripens, and keep fallen fruit picked up.        Bears are very intelligent. They remember  any place they have ever found food and  return unerringly to it. They know what  trash cans and bird feeders are and will  always investigate them for food. We’re  asking all Sandia Heights residents to be  tolerant, understanding, and proactive.  Enjoy the sight of a bear if you happen to  see one, but please don’t do anything to  unintentionally feed them or injure them.       Please feel free to call your BearWatch  Sandia Heights Wildlife Steward (Kate Fry,  828-9618) or BearWatch (Jan Hayes, 281- 9282) at any time if you have questions.              The GRIT, July 2010                                                                                                         Page 8              ACC Activity Log     The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.    3 Sandia Heights Drive – Window & Door  Replacement.

This year we are holding our annual Garden Tour on Saturday,  July 24. This is later in the summer than the tour has been held in the past,  but we thought that this year it would be interesting to see how our gardens  look as we get a little further into summer. We will begin our tour at 9:00 a.m.  at the home of Kathryn Lazier, 7715 Cedar Canyon Court. The locations for the  other gardens on the tour will be provided at the first home. Charlie  McDonald will also be leading interested residents on weekly evening strolls  to look for and identify wildflowers and other native plants in the Sandia  Heights community. These leisurely wildflower walks will be conducted on  Tuesday evenings at 7:30 p.m. during the months of June, July and August.  Interested Sandia Heights residents should plan to meet Connie and Charlie  McDonald at their house which is located at 1405 San Rafael Place. Please  wear sturdy shoes and bring water. We promise not to walk too fast or to  venture too far. We have changed the date of our annual Potluck from  September 18 to September 25. Members are also reminded to check their  email for periodic updates about Wildflower Club activities. Connie and  Charlie McDonald can be reached at 797-2620.
