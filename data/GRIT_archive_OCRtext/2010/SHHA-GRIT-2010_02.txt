  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                        February 2010        Vice President’s Message   ~ Phyllis Moore       As your SHHA Vice President, I recently  represented SHHA at the Bernalillo County  District 4 Coalition meeting. The January 6th  meeting was the perfect opportunity for  District 4 Neighborhood Association Leaders  to meet their District Representatives, and  conversely, for the Legislators to get to know  Neighborhood Leaders and learn from them  how they can help to make their communities  better. Again the purpose of this meeting is to  get more acquainted with all of our  neighborhoods within District 4 and for the  residential leadership to hear and become  aware about the various issues and concerns  facing our respective communities. Feedback  was given to the Bernalillo County leadership  that their website is not very comprehensive  with information nor very user friendly. We  then learned that they are currently working to  change both content and ease of use and were  aware of the shortfalls.      A major theme that surfaced at this meeting  was the Railrunner train and all the issues this  new transit service is causing.  Concerns  surfaced about traffic in loading and  unloading areas, security at the loading  stations at night, and the unreasonable number  of times the train blows its horn daily.    Since many of the New Mexico House and  Senate Legislators were in attendance too and  were offered a few minutes to speak, budget  concerns and Tax Lightning surfaced. Both  topics will be ongoing issues as we enter the  new year.      County Commissioner Michael Weiner did  report that the widening of Eubank to Paseo is  on schedule and will be an eleven (11) month  project beginning March of this year. A  public hearing will be held soon for the North  Abq Acres residents to address their concerns  during this construction.    On another topic, as your current SHHA Vice  President, I am beginning our search for new  officers interested in serving on the SHHA  Board for next year (2010-2011).  We  currently have a great team and I know we  will need additional volunteers and Board  Members as we begin our new year that starts  at our annual meeting in June.  Please drop  me an email pamoore367@msn.com or give  me a phone call (828-1639) so we can discuss  and explore your interest as an SHHA Board  Member or a volunteer on a specific  committee. We need your ideas, your  different perspectives and your skills in order  to effectively serve this unique community  that we all call home.     MAIL THEFT    Mail theft is still a  problem! We advise that  you take your outgoing  mail to the Post Office. If  the option is available it  might be best to have sensitive information  like checks, insurance and mortgage papers  sent to your bank branch and you can pick  them up from there, rather than having them  sent to your house. Likewise, consider  opening a post office box and have your mail  sent there. Otherwise, keep your eye out for  the postman and get your mail out of your box  quickly. The closest collection box is at the  Circle K office. Pick-up time is 4pm Mon-Sat.  The GRIT, Feb 2010                                                                                                               Page 2  Radon  Mailing Address  Environmental Health/Air Quality Division  P.O. Box 1293 Albuquerque, NM 87102  Physical Address  1 Civic Plaza   Room 3047   Phone: (505) 768-1972  Fax: (505) 768-1977  Email: aqd@cabq.gov                 Radon is an invisible, odorless gas known to  cause cancer. Everyone is exposed to Radon at  some level. Millions of homes and buildings  contain high levels of Radon gas. The EPA  and the Office of the Surgeon General  recommend that all homes below the third  floor be tested for Radon. Because Radon is  invisible and odorless, a simple test is the only  way to determine if a home has high Radon  levels.     New Mexico Environment Department    • The New Mexico Environment Department,  in conjunction with the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, have designated January  2009 as Radon Action Month.   • Starting in January, NMED will have free  radon test kits available for NM residents  willing to share their test results as part of a  statewide radon survey.   • To participate, please call 1-800-324-5928  to request form.     Health Effects From Radon Exposure   • No immediate symptoms.   • Estimated to contribute to between 7,000  and 30,000 lung cancer deaths each year.  • Smokers are at higher risk of developing  Radon-induced lung cancer.     Steps to Reduce Exposure to Radon   • Take action if your Radon level is 4  picocuries per liter (pCi/L) or higher.   • Radon levels of less than 4 pCi/L still pose a  risk, and in many cases, may be reduced.      How to Get a Radon Test Kit  • Test your home for Radon - it is easy and  inexpensive. Requests for Radon Test kits  can be sent to the National Safety Council’s  1-800-SOS-RADON number ($9.95) or  Lowes Home Improvement Centers ($16.88)  per the NM Environment Department.                 A Brief Message from Your  Parks & Safety Committee    We are very pleased to see many of you  walking on the correct side of the street when  out on our roads. However, there are still a  few of you that are walking on the wrong side.   Remember, if you cannot make eye contact  with oncoming drivers, you are not walking on  the correct side of the road. Also, although  wearing a reflective vest is unnecessary during  the daylight hours, it becomes very important  near dusk and later in the evening. It is  wonderful to see how many of our neighbors  are improving their health by making the  effort to walk out of doors a little more! Let’s  also work at making our neighborhood a  friendlier place by smiling and waving at our  neighbors as they drive by us. A smile can  really brighten your day as well as that of  others!    We also want to remind drivers to be extra  vigilant when driving our curvy roads; and,  please, remember to go no faster than the  posted speed limits.    Hope each of you have an opportunity to visit  one of our neighborhood parks soon. The  playground equipment has been updated, a  few adult exercise stations have been added  and drainage has been improved. Thank you  Bernalillo County!

Obstruction of views by trees has been one  of the more frequent homeowner concerns  received by the Association over the years.  Now several homeowners have picked up a  SHHA Tree Removal Lottery Application  from the SHHA Office and are working to  have their trees removed. Should they be  one of the several that will win the lottery in  June, it will have cost them nothing to have  their tree(s) removed!     Please see the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or drop by the  SHHA office for complete information on  Lottery eligibility, entry, and rules.    The lottery is open to SHHA members only.  Not a member of the SHHA? Join with your  neighbors now and do your part to support  Sandia Heights and enjoy the many benefits  of membership, including the Tree Lottery.

It is for the recognition of  “Extraordinary Service to Sandia Heights.”   The names of the recipients of our volunteer  recognition awards are listed on this plaque.  This may be in acknowledgement for years  of service, for outstanding accomplishments,  or for a special recent service award.      A Volunteer Recognition Luncheon was  instituted by our Board a few years ago in  order to recognize and, hopefully, to serve  as an ongoing incentive to SHHA  volunteers. In conjunction with the  luncheon, awards have been given to several  worthy volunteers.      The following are a list of those who have  previously earned special recognition for  their years of extraordinary service:  Lena  Martinez (04/08), Robert Francis (04/08),  Ed Whitten (10/08), Terry Taggart (04/08),  Kerney Bolton 04/08), Sheraz Saint-Lot  (10/08), Marsha Thole (04/09), Peter  Heinstein (04/09), George Conner (10/09),  and Don Wortman (10/09). Each of their  names are listed on the plaque.    The next time you are in the SHHA Office, I  hope you will look for this beautiful plaque  on the west wall.  And maybe one day, your  own name will be added to the plaque in  recognition of your extraordinary service to  Sandia Heights!                SECURTY ALERT    The office has a security email alert that can  be emailed to all of those people whose  email addresses are in our database.
