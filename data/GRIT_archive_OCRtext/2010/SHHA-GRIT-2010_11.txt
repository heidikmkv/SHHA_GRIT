I know our SHHA committees have been  really busy the past month, especially the  Community Service and Membership  Committee. They hosted the recent  Coffeehouse Concert series on 17 September  and on 25 September they also hosted our  Meet and Greet. They collaboratively worked  with the Architectural Control Committee  and arranged to have George Schroeder and  Chris Gonzales of the Bernalillo County  Office of Environmental Health speak about  the new County wastewater regulations. The  meeting was well attended and as a result our  County Commissioner, Michael Wiener  hearing your questions and concerns we will  be organizing an ad hoc committee to further  explore alternatives for our community. We  have a few names of interested residents that  signed up for the ad hoc committee at our  original meeting, however, if you are  interested and are willing to expend some of  your time for a few additional meetings,  please contact the SHHA office by Tuesday,  November 9.        The purpose of the committee will be to  work with Commissioner Wiener to request  case-by-case exceptions to the County  wastewater ordinance and to explore the  possibility of installing sewer lines in Sandia  Heights. I know our County Commissioner  jumped into action on Monday following our  meeting and he has started the ball rolling  with the appropriate county officials. At this  time, we envision a meeting or two with our  newly organized ad hoc residential committee  and the appropriate county personnel. Then  after that, we anticipate another public  meeting for the entire community giving the  results of our additional research and possible  alternatives and related costs. We hope to  make all of this happen by March of next  year. Stay tuned and we will use the GRIT to  keep you informed of any future meeting.  Again a special thanks to all of our volunteers  who made these two events a reality. Just a  quick reminder, the deadline for our annual  photo contest is Friday, 5 November.         With sadness, I recall our mid July  meeting with Richard Abruzzo, President of  the Sandia Heights Services. Richard, who is  presumed lost in a gas balloon accident over  the Adriatic Sea, will be gravely missed in  our Sandia Heights community. As I reflect  on our July meeting, I remember his positive  and collaborative attitude as we all that  morning discussed possibilities for our  community and potential additional  membership benefits. I know you share with  me in expressing our deepest sympathy to his  immediate family and to the entire staff of  Sandia Heights Services. Richard will be  missed in our immediate community and in  the greater Albuquerque area as well.         The GRIT, Nov 2010                                                                                                            Page 2  Roadside Mowing       It doesn’t seem fair, but the features that  make our Sandia Heights roads so  picturesque also make them dangerous.  Our  roads are narrow and winding, and are used  by bicycles and pedestrians as well as by  cars. We don’t have sidewalks for  pedestrians to use, nor do we want them— sidewalks would change the unique  character of our community, and not for the  better. The natural vegetation growing along  the roads is also an important part of the  look of Sandia Heights. The problem arises  when the vegetation grows right up to the  edge of the road or even out over the road,  obscuring sight lines at intersections and  preventing people who are walking from  getting off the road when cars go by. None  of us wants an accident to happen because of  this situation!      As you are aware, property owners are  responsible for maintaining the County  right-of-way, which is the part of your  property next to the edge of the road. While  the County right-of-way extends about  seven feet from the edge of the road, the  area we’re concerned with in this article is  the three-foot-wide area right next to the  road. Maintaining this area includes  removing vegetation (such as chamisa) and  keeping grasses and other native plants  trimmed to preserve sight lines and allow  pedestrians to walk on that area if necessary.     If property owners do not maintain the  County right-of-way, the County can and  will mow these areas to ensure clear lines of  sight. The County usually mows the first  three or four feet.    SHHA and the County Public Works  Department frequently get calls from  residents asking for cutting and mowing of  roadside brush.  SHHA and the County also  get many calls from residents objecting to  cutting and mowing that has taken place.   The reality is that when the County mows  the roadsides, they mow over chamisa,  grasses, cactus, juniper saplings,  wildflowers, and whatever else is growing  there, and the results are not attractive. In  addition to the unsightly result of ragged  bare branches, mowing chamisa does not  eliminate the problem—it just stimulates the  chamisa to grow more vigorously. We  individual homeowners can do a much tidier  job, and indeed we should be doing it  anyway. The County cannot accommodate  individual requests to opt out of mowing;  however, they will not mow sections of the  road that are well enough maintained not to  need mowing.     So here’s the deal. If you don’t like the  way the roadsides look when the County  mows them, you must take the initiative and  groom the sides of the roads along your  property.  This means removing chamisa  and other woody plants (that is, digging  them out by the roots) and either cutting  short or trimming and thinning grasses and  wildflowers to preserve sight lines and  provide an “escape route” for pedestrians.   Bernalillo County has told SHHA that if you  keep the right-of-way trimmed along your  property, they will refrain from mowing  that section. It may be a lot of work  initially, but the results will be worth the  effort. Neighbors could pool their efforts to  periodically clean up and trim an entire  street. It’s a great way to get to know each  other, and it’s a good feeling to know that  you’re working together to keep Sandia  Heights looking the way we want it to!

Your SHHA Board of Directors was very  pleased with the overwhelming support  expressed by you, our Members, for tree  removal and for the Tree Lottery.  The  Board has once again voted to run a tree  lottery for another year and raised the total  winnings to $7,500.00. Trees cut since this  year’s SHHA Annual Meeting, June 12th,  2010 are eligible for a drawing at next  June’s Annual Meeting.          Eighty-nine percent of our residents have  stated that they were either very or  somewhat concerned with undue obstruction  of views by trees.* Now is the time to act on  our convictions and do our part to curtail,  reduce, and reverse the otherwise relentless  advance of trees into our distant mountain  and valley views. The SHHA Tree Lottery  will once again provide an excellent chance  for all Association Members to have all or  most of their tree removal costs paid for by  the Association!          Are any of your trees interfering with  your enjoyment of Sandia Mountain or the  Rio Grande Valley? Are they interfering  with the views of your neighbors? If the  answer is yes, now is a good time to add tree  removal to your list of Fall cleanup jobs.     Lottery Rules    • Must be a member of the SHHA   • Trees must have been cut and removed after  June 12, 2010  • Any size Siberian Elm** may be entered  (including young sprouts)  • Siberian Elm stumps must be treated to  prevent re-growth  • Trees of all species over 26 feet tall are  eligible  • Trees on County rights-of-way  are eligible  • Only Tree Owner can give permission  for tree removal    To Apply  • Fill out a Lottery application at the SHHA  Office  • Provide a paid copy of the invoice for tree  removal    Winners  • Drawings will follow the SHHA Annual  Meeting in June 2011  • Need not be present to win  •  Winners will receive actual cost of removal,  including GRT, up to a maximum of  $750.00 per tree  • Drawings will continue until a total of  $7,500.00 has been awarded              Please see the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or drop by the  SHHA office for complete Lottery  eligibility, entry, and rules.

The covenants were drafted by  the original developers and registered in  Bernalillo County to ensure the integrity,  quality and appearance, and indeed to  maintain the values of the properties in all  the Units. Every property owner in Sandia  Heights was given the covenants when  purchasing property in Sandia Heights and  should know that this is a covenant- controlled community and that adherence to  the Unit covenants and to the applicable  ordinances of Bernalillo County is the  responsibility of each and every property  owner in Sandia Heights.       The responsibility to uphold and enforce  the covenants is the duty of two committees  staffed entirely by volunteer homeowners  who serve terms lasting three years. These  committees are the Architectural Control  Committee (ACC) and the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC). The ACC is  responsible for maintaining the external  architectural appearance of all SHHA  properties as covered by the covenants,  while the CSC is responsible for all other  situations and conditions defined in the  covenants. Neither of these committees  engages in active patrolling to look for  covenant violations. Both committees have  established procedures where alleged  violations, initiated through written  complaints from the SHHA members, are  investigated to determine if the complaints  are valid.     Once the violation has been documented  and determined to be valid, letters are sent  by either the ACC or CSC or both, to the  violator with notification of the nature of the  violation and asking that the violation be  corrected  within a given time deadline. The  majority of violations are resolved at this  stage. Only a few cases require a second  letter or follow-up visit.     However, there are a few cases (about 3%  of the original complaints) in which the  property owners choose to ignore these  letters and visits, which leaves the two  committees and SHHA no choice but to  engage the services of the SHHA attorney  and possibly the courts for compliance.  Legal costs resulting from involvement of  the SHHA attorney may range from $300 to  $5,000 or more. Since all SHHA activities  and functions are entirely supported by your  membership dues, such extraordinary  measures for covenant enforcement are  actually paid for by every member of  SHHA.       Many of these problematic covenant  violations requiring expensive attorney  involvement and court action could be  resolved with a minimum of effort and  expenditure of funds on the part of the  offending property owner. For example, a  resident failed to apply to the ACC for  approval to replace an old garage door with  a new one, which happens to be white in  color. The covenants prohibit white garage  doors. To date, about $1,300 has been spent  on legal fees, and more funds will be  required if the case has to be taken to court.  The entire situation could have been avoided  if the homeowner had hired someone (or  spent part of a day himself) to paint the door  an acceptable color or bought a door with an  acceptable color in the first place. What a  needless waste of our SHHA member fees!     In another example it cost the SHHA and  each and every member a total of $1,200 to  The GRIT, Nov 2010                                                                                                                Insert  get a resident to remove a trash container  from the street after trash pickup.  Similarly, every Unit covenant states that  travel trailers (this includes fifth wheels,  RV’s, motor homes, campers, and boat  trailers  as interpreted by the courts in a  2005 SHHA case) are prohibited from being  stored in Sandia Heights, except for a period  of 48 hours before and after a trip for the  purpose of loading and unloading. Yet at  present, there are several motor homes,  travel trailers and boats parked throughout  SHHA. Again, repeated letters from the  CSC brought no response from the  offending residents.  The eventual resolution  of this situation will require involvement of  the SHHA attorney and courts to force these  residents to move these items,  which will  cost every member of SHHA. Again, the  inconsiderate actions of a few are resulting  in significant costs being borne by the entire  community!     So how do we remedy these situations  which require a large amount of time and  expense for the CSC, ACC, and SHHA and  encourage residents to respond to letters and  visits from the ACC and CSC?  In cases  involving court action, we have asked  judges to rule that SHHA can recover  attorney fees and court costs from the  offending property owner.         Another possibility is to spend some of our  monetary reserves, which may require an  increase in the SHHA dues. This remedy  would penalize all SHHA members because  of a very small number of property owners  who disregard the covenants. Such measures  are perhaps drastic but may have to be  considered.     Clearly, then, the best solution would be to  obtain the cooperation of the few who insist  on blatantly disregarding the covenants and  the attempts by SHHA to enforce the  covenants for the benefit of the entire  community.     SHHA would appreciate comments,  thoughts, and suggestions from our members  to help solve the problems caused by  recalcitrant property owners who refuse to  adhere to our covenants.                    SHHA Membership Cards &  Merchant Benefit Program            Your SHHA member benefits and services  include: office and notary services, annual  classified ads, Coffeehouse Concert Series,  Sandia Tram passes, tree lottery, covenant  enforcement, no-fee ACC applications, and  discounted safety vests.
