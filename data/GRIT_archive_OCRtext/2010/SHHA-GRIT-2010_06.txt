Democracy means involvement!      President’s Message by Andy Anderson                Another year has slipped by and it is time  for our SHHA Annual Meeting. As in the  past, we really need your help by spending  about an hour with us on Saturday, June 12,  to support your organization and to ensure we  have enough members to conduct the  meeting. This milestone also represents the  end of my tour as your President.                This year has been another good year for  SHHA. We have continued to ensure the  quality of life in Sandia Heights by ensuring  our residents respect their neighbors and the  covenants which are intended to maintain our  neighborhood standards provide for the  pristine community in which we all live. Our  Committees have worked diligently  throughout the year to provide service to the  community by enforcing covenants and  resolving complaints between residents. In  addition to being responsive to compliance  tasks, our committees have worked to provide  our members with additional services and  benefits. The free Tram passes continue to be  a big hit with our members and we have  increased the number of passes available on a  daily basis from 4 to 6. The pool passes had  not been as attractive as we had anticipated,  but we may continue to provide them on a  scaled back basis. We hope you are taking  advantage of the discounts offered by our  local restaurants and businesses by using your  membership cards. We also have our unsung  heroes in the background looking out for your  safety and keeping the chamisa trimmed  along our roadways (by request). As you will  see at the annual meeting, one of our  committees has been working for the past  several years to bring our bylaws up to date,  culminating in this year’s revision to align the  bylaws with our guiding principles of Roberts  Rules of Order Newly Revised. We have also  continued to maintain a close relationship  with our County and State representatives to  ensure they are aware of our SHHA needs  and desires.

I would like to express my sincere  appreciation and gratitude to all of them for  their dedication and tireless efforts, making  my job so much easier.        A very special thank you goes out to  these people who have served on the board  and committees, dedicating their time and  efforts:  Frances Desonier has served: on the board,  as secretary, on the Parks & Safety and  Community Service & Membership  committees since 2007   Larry Desonier has served: on the board  and on the Parks and Safety Committee  since 2000  Jim Irving has served: on the board, the  Covenant Support and Bylaws committees  since 2005  Melissa Puckett has served: on the board  and Community Service & Membership  committee since 2009  Mona Lee Schilling has served: on the  board and the Community Service &  Membership committee since 2004  Marsha Thole has served: on the board, as  secretary, on the Architectural Control and  Bylaws committees since 2005       Also, special recognition goes to Duane  Henden, who recently passed away, for  serving on the Bylaws committee for 3  years. His time and contribution was  invaluable.       To all of our members, I would like to  thank you for the opportunity to serve you  over this past year.                Proposed Bylaw amendments  Please go to the website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org for full  information. To assist you in understanding  the proposed amendments, and to expedite  discussion time at the annual meeting, the  Bylaws Committee will hold a Q&A session  at the SHHA office on Monday, June 7 at  11a.m.              Nominating Committee    ~ Phyllis Moore, Chair         Your SHHA Board of Directors would  like to thank Ana Acosta, Sandra Brown,  George Connor and Sarah Pirkl for their  commitment to serve the Sandia Heights  community. In accordance with our bylaws,  the SHHA Board of Directors requires 14  members in order to look after the interests  of the Association. The volunteer services of  these four new directors brings us to a total  of 16 directors, which barely allows us to  function as an organization to oversee the  well being of our community.        Although serving on the Board requires a  commitment on the part of individuals, it is  truly a rewarding experience when the fruits  of our efforts are utilized and recognized by  the 2100 households in our community. The  Board encourages you to take up the  challenge and join us in the experience.    Officer Election Results: The following is  the slate of officers elected for the 2010- 2011 operational year:  Phyllis Moore, President  Kate Fry, Vice President  Michele Munson, Secretary  Ed Tull, Treasurer    Returning BOD Member nominations for  a second 3-year term:   Andy Anderson – 507 Black Bear Loop  Pete Heinstein – 185 Big Horn Ridge    New Board Member nominees:   Ana Acosta - 935 Bobcat Blvd.  Sandra Brown - 1411 Bluebell Place     George Connor - 8227 Raintree Drive  Sarah Pirkl - 2007 Quail Run Drive            The GRIT, June 2010                                                                                                            Page 3              Covenant Support Committee    ~ Dick Wavrik, Chair         Most of the Sandia Heights Unit  Covenants address light pollution. This is  done to preserve the enjoyment of the night  sky from light pollution. Regardless of the  individual covenants for your Unit, the  entire North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia  Heights fall under the Bernalillo County  Code for light pollution. The code includes,  but is not restricted to security lighting,  street lights, landscape lights, building  mounted area lights, building façade lights  (see Code for exceptions).  In general, lights  shall remain OFF between 11:00 pm and  sunrise; lights on buildings shall be mounted  no higher than 16 feet; lights must be  shielded so the light is directed  perpendicular to the ground. The entire  Code may be viewed using the link on the  SHHA Web site.       So, if you leave your lights on at the  entry, garage doors, house floods, after  11:00pm and they are not shielded they may  be in violation of the County Code. While  the CSC does not enforce County ordinances  we will work with folks to make them aware  of the options and try to get resolution.       At night, even a 40 watt bulb in an  unshielded fixture can be a distraction to  those that wish to enjoy the night sky, the  darkness of the neighborhood, or the lights  of the city below.                SHHA Membership Cards &  Merchant Benefit Program             Your SHHA member benefits and  services include: office and notary services,  annual classified ads, Coffeehouse Concert  Series, Sandia Tram Passes, covenant  enforcement, no-fee ACC applications, and  discounted safety vests.

We cannot make your reservations over  the phone but you can call the office and  find out if passes are available for the date  you want. Once you bring your $5 deposit  per pass (cash or check only) we will issue  you an authorization letter stating the  number of passes and the specific date you  are going on the Tram.      Once this letter is issued you may NOT  change the date. If you do not use the  authorization letter you will lose your  deposit. We will ONLY reimburse you if the  Tram is closed. You have thirty days from  the time you ride the Tram to come back to  the office with all of your Tram ticket stubs  to get a refund of your deposit. If you are  unable to come to the office during our  normal business hours you may mail us the  stubs or deposit them in the wooden drop  box that is standing next to the front  entrance of the office and we will mail you a  refund check.  Please note: After 5pm the $1  parking fee is waived.

We had no need of another magazine subscription so  we gave them a donation, a check made out to AMG. On Thursday  of that week, a friend in the University area of the city sent an E- mail alert telling of solicitors in her neighborhood using the same  story presented to us. We were scammed. It was too late for us but  maybe someone else will read this letter and avoid an unpleasant  experience.

WIENER, DISTRICT 4       I'd like to take this opportunity to update  you on some of the issues that I’ve been  working on over the past couple of  months....       The $25 million Eubank Blvd  Improvement Project continues with the  project design complete and all rights of  entry to the condemned properties having  been granted.   The project has also been  expanded to include the widening of Eubank  even further north of Paseo del Norte than  was originally planned.  The project will be  put out for bid in June and I expect the  groundbreaking to take place,  finally, in mid-July.       It has been my goal since taking office to  find a suitable way to honor our  most famous/well-known resident of District  4.  On Tuesday June 29th, Bernalillo County  will be naming a NE Heights park located at  10802 Wilshire NE after the last man to set  foot on the Moon; former U.S. Senator and  astronaut Harrison "Jack" Schmitt.  Soon  “Senator Harrison "Jack" Schmitt Park" will  be a reality.  As you probably know, Dr.  Schmitt was the only geologist and the last  of only 12 men to visit the moon, as part of  NASA’s final Apollo lunar mission in  December 1972.  [Editorial Note: We are  honored to have Jack as a resident of Sandia  Heights.]       As always, I consider it a privilege to  serve you! I am continuously available to  discuss any issue with you.

This  year we are holding our annual Garden Tour on Saturday, July 31. This is later in the  summer than the tour has been held in the past, but we thought that this year it would  be interesting to see how our gardens look as we get a little further into summer. If  anyone would like to have their garden included on the tour, please contact Connie  McDonald at 727-2620. Charlie McDonald will also be leading interested residents on  weekly evening strolls to look for and identify wildflowers and other native plants in  the Sandia Heights community. These leisurely wildflower walks will be conducted on  Tuesday evenings at 7:30PM during the months of June, July, and August. Interested  Sandia Heights residents should plan to meet Connie and Charlie McDonald at their  house which is located at 1405 San Rafael Place.  Please wear sturdy shoes and bring  water. We promise not to walk too fast or to venture too far.  We have changed the  date of our annual Potluck from September 18 to September 25. Look for more  information about this event and about the annual Garden tour in next month’s Grit.  Members are also reminded to check their email for periodic updates about Wildflower  Club activities.    Sandia Heights Artists News…The weather is warming up and so are  we!
