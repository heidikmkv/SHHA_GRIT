  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                            March 2010              President’s Message   ~ Andy Anderson         Hopefully we have seen the last  snowstorm and can now look forward to  longer days and shorter nights. With spring  upon us, there will be more folks out for early  morning and late evening walks. For  motorists, that means we need to be more  vigilant for those walking along our winding  roads. For those out getting their daily  exercise we would ask that you are cautious  of vehicles and use common sense, walking  facing traffic. For a little extra visibility,  SHHA still offers reflective vests to everyone  in Sandia Heights and at a reduced rate for  members. We hope you take advantage of the  warmer weather and enjoy our beautiful  community.       I know we have had several messages  regarding mailbox theft and we all were  hoping it would decline after the holidays.  Unfortunately, it still remains a continuing  problem in our community. We would ask  you to be vigilant in getting your mail out of  your mailbox as soon as possible after  delivery. We also suggest that you do not put  outgoing mail in your mailbox and, instead,  use a drop box or drop it off at the Post  Office. If you notice any suspicious vehicles  in the neighborhood, please contact Sandia  Heights security 263-4654 or the Sheriff’s  office 798-7000 relaying the circumstances  and, if possible, a description of the vehicle.         Our annual meeting is approaching fast  and we are still looking for volunteers to  serve on your Association’s Board or as  Committee members. The pay is not the best  in the community, however, the satisfaction  for serving your community is rewarding. For  those interested in serving, please get in touch  with the SHHA office or call Phyllis Moore,  Chairperson of our Nominating Committee at  828-1639.                County Line         On 25 January, District 4 County  Commissioner Michael Weiner, a Bernalillo  County Environmental Health representative  and the owner and president of the County  Line Restaurant and affected residents  conducted a neighborhood meeting regarding  noise levels and parking issues for the  proposed County Line music series outdoor  summer 2010 concerts.         Differing views were aired at the meeting,  ranging from support to opposition.  The  County of Bernalillo Office of Environment  Health representative reported how they  monitored the noise level for the residents and  adjustments to the outdoor staging in order to  have the least impact on the residents within  the immediate community.         After all the discussion, the music series  outdoor concerts will continue again this year.   The Roadrunner Food Bank will again benefit  from the individual food donations and  monetary contributions from those attending  the concerts.       This year there will be 13 outdoor concerts  between May and August and will be held  again on Thursday evenings from 7-9pm only.  Three SHHA Board members attended the  meeting:  Robert Bower, Marsha Thole and  Phyllis Moore.  The GRIT, Mar 2010                                                                                                               Page 2  MAIL THEFT    Sandia Heights Security  says that mail theft is  still a problem! We  have had a number of  mail thefts going back  to Christmas.   Residents are advised not leave mail in  mailboxes, either incoming or outgoing. If  you cannot retrieve your mail promptly ask  a trusted neighbor to get it for you. If you  are leaving town suspend your mail  delivery, have it held at the Post Office.  If you have mail that would be considered  sensitive, you may want to mail it at a USPS  office.   Another suggestion might be to replace your  mailbox with either a heavy duty locking  type or totally enclosing the box  with acceptable construction and a lock to  impede vandals as well as thieves.  The MO of the perpetrators has been early  mornings, when folks are out walking.  Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle  checking mailboxes. A license number on a  vehicle along with a vehicle description  would go a long way to putting an end to  this activity.   If you experience mail theft, notify the  BCSO (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1- 877-876-2455), and Sandia Heights Security  (856-6347). If you witness a crime in  progress notify BCSO and Security.                  Odds & Ends from Parks &  Safety Committee  Larry & Frances Desonier    As everyone who has read the GRIT over  the last couple of years will know, we  always end this article with the Pedestrian  Safety Reminders. These are so very  important, especially walking against traffic  and having light clothes and reflective  material after dark. It is unfortunate that  some folks just won’t do this – it’s baffling.  Here is a quote from an email one of our  concerned neighbors sent us. “We were  coming home last night between 6:15 and  6:30pm - East on San Rafael, turning North  onto Bobcat.  Just before we started to turn,  we saw a female jogging South on Bobcat,  turning East onto San Rafael. Realize, it is  ALMOST dark; our headlights are ON. As  we started to make our turn, we had to  literally SLAM on the brakes to avoid  hitting two young males on bicycles  following the female jogger. What terrified  us was that we could have hit them.  None  of them were wearing any kind of reflective  clothing; there were no lights or reflectors  on the bicycles and no one was carrying a  flashlight that was on. It frightened us  terribly. We hope that Sandia Heights Grit  will write up another article about walking,  jogging, biking, etc - especially regarding  safety rules while out in the dark.”    So please, please, please follow the safety  reminders below.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders  • Walk Facing Traffic; make eye  contact with drivers approaching  you.  • Wear reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening.   • If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.  • Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single  file.    Safety Vests for sale in  the SHHA office. $2 per  vest for members and $4  per vest for non-members.

Obstruction of views by trees has been  one of the more frequent homeowner  concerns received by the Association over  the years. Now several homeowners have  picked up a SHHA Tree Removal Lottery  Application from the SHHA Office and are  working to have their trees removed. Should  they be one of the several that will win the  lottery in June, it will have cost them  nothing to have their tree(s) removed!        Please see the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or drop by the  SHHA office for complete information on  Lottery eligibility, entry, and rules.

It is hard to believe we are planning for  our upcoming SHHA Annual meeting on 12  June. (Mark your calendars!) However, your  current Board members are starting to think,  prepare and plan for that meeting. As we  plan we are very cognizant that we will be  losing five Board Members effective in  June. We need Sandia Heights residents to  volunteer to replace these Board Member  positions and/or volunteers to serve on a  committee.         As your current Vice President, it is my  responsibility to recruit volunteers. Please  give me a call if you are willing to serve our  Sandia Heights community. You will learn  more about the area in which you live, you  will get to know additional residents who  are also volunteering and care about our  community. Please drop me an email:  pamoore367@msn.com or give me a phone  call at 828-1639. We certainly hope we can  count on you to serve.
