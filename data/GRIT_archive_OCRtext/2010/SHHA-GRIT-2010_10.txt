    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           October 2010               Vice President’s Message by   Kate Fry     Once again, it seems like summer flew  by, and now the days are getting shorter and  the nights a bit chilly. With the sun coming  up later and going down earlier, we all need  to keep an eye out for kids at the bus stop in  the morning and people out enjoying our  spectacular fall weather. Early morning and  late evening walkers might want to think  about getting one of our reflective vests. You  can pick one up at the SHHA office for  cheap!   The Bernalillo County roads supervisor  and his crew have been busy removing elm  saplings along Tramway Road. We very  much appreciate their efforts to beautify this  road that is traveled by so many out-of-town  visitors. As you know, the County will also  remove unwanted trees from your property if  they are in the right-of-way, usually several  feet from the edge of the road. You can call  848-1503 to put in a request. Remember that  you may ask to have trees removed only from  the right-of-way on your own property.  As you saw in the August GRIT, the 2010  Tree Lottery was a great success. I am  pleased to announce that the 2011 Tree  Lottery will run from June 12, 2010 to the  2011 SHHA Annual Meeting. So if you pay  to have a qualifying tree removed during this  period, save the receipt. Look for the article  on page 3 for eligibility and lottery rules.  We had several bear visits this summer,  most likely because spring was cold and early  summer was dry, which disrupted the bears’  natural food supply. We had a bumper crop  of acorns in late summer, but unfortunately,  once bears figure out there is easy food in our  neighborhood, they will continue to check out  places where they have found it. This  includes garbage that is put outside before  trash pickup day, bird feeders and  hummingbird feeders (bear candy!), pet food,  and fruit trees. We are now in the season  when the bears are trying to pack on the  pounds so they can make it through the  winter in hibernation. Bears usually go into  dens in November, so please continue to be  vigilant. Keep garbage in the garage and put  it outside no earlier than the morning of trash  pickup. Don’t feed your pets outside. Bring  bird feeders inside at night. Bears demolished  several empty bird feeders during the  summer—they know those things usually  have birdseed in them, and they will go after  feeders even if they are empty. Keep ripe  fruit picked and clean up fallen fruit. Please  feel free to call me at 828-9618 if you have  any questions about coexisting with bears or  other wildlife. And above all, enjoy the  privilege of living in this beautiful area and  sometimes getting a glimpse of our wild  neighbors!     BEAR SIGHTINGS:       Bear sightings should be called in to NM  Game and Fish at either 222-4700 or 222- 4719. The call will be logged and NMG&F  will determine the appropriate action to be  taken, which may be trapping and  relocating. If the bear is threatening persons  or pets, please call the emergency number.  That number is (505) 827- 9372. This number should  be called ONLY if a bear is  actively threatening persons  or pets.

The Bernalillo  County Code Section 66-225 states:  (h) Unobstructed vision for traffic safety shall  be strictly and solely maintained by the  property owner and occupant on all corner  lots, regardless of the zone classification, with  reference to any vehicle, trailer, sign, fence,  ornament, hedge, shrub, tree, display or any  other obstruction, but not including buildings.  No such obstruction to view between three  and eight feet above the gutter line shall be  placed or maintained within the clear sight  triangle which is a triangular area at the street  corner, which area is bounded by and  whichever is the lesser of:   (1) The curb lines of a street intersection and  a line extended to the curb lines connecting  points on the property lines 25 feet distant  from the intersection of the property lines of  the corner lot in such street intersection; or   (2) The curb lines of an intersection and line  connecting points 35 feet distant from the  corner of the intersection and such corner is  determined by projecting the curb lines out  to a specified point.   (i) Any owner, occupant or agent in charge  of all corner lots failing to comply with the  provisions of subsection (g), (h) and (i) of  this section, shall be liable to the county for  any claim or demand made upon the county  which arises from, either directly or  indirectly, the erection of, or failure to  maintain, any vehicle, trailer, sign, fence,  ornament, hedge, shrub, tree or display  which obstructs the clear sight triangle, or  which hides or obscures any official traffic  control device, railroad sign or signal.

Your SHHA Board of Directors was very  pleased with the overwhelming support  expressed by you, our Members, for tree  removal and for the Tree Lottery.  The  Board has once again voted to run a tree  lottery for another year and raised the total  winnings to $7,500.00. Trees cut since this  year’s SHHA Annual Meeting, June 12th,  2010 are eligible for a drawing at next  June’s Annual Meeting.        Eighty-nine percent of our residents have  stated that they were either very or  somewhat concerned with undue obstruction  of views by trees.* Now is the time to act on  our convictions and do our part to curtail,  reduce, and reverse the otherwise relentless  advance of trees into our distant mountain  and valley views. The SHHA Tree Lottery  will once again provide an excellent chance  for all Association Members to have all or  most of their tree removal costs paid for by  the Association!        Are any of your trees interfering with  your enjoyment of Sandia Mountain or the  Rio Grande Valley? Are they interfering  with the views of your neighbors? If the  answer is yes, now is a good time to add tree  removal to your list of Fall cleanup jobs.

In an effort to "Go Green" and  reduce the amount of trash in our landfills, the  curbside recycling program began on July 1,  2010. Participation is available to all residents  at no extra charge. The success of the pilot program allowed SHS  to implement recycling as part of the normal solid waste  collection services. Please place your recyclables in tightly  secured clear plastic bags or plastic grocery store bags along with  your regular waste by the curbside by 7AM on your regular  collection day every other week – please see the calendar for  specific  dates.  The  calendar  can  be  found  at  http://sandiaheightsservices.com.  If you can’t find clear plastic  bags, use what you have and just be sure your recycling can be  distinguished from your regular trash.

Wiener   for District 4, 688-0004 (cell #) or at 858- 0004 (home #)         Many exciting and positive changes are  taking place in Bernalillo County as we head  into the Fall season. The much anticipated  Eubank Boulevard expansion (from Academy  north to Paseo del Norte NE) to four lanes is  finally underway. This $25 million long- delayed project had its ground-breaking on  September 15th - with construction  commencing on September 27th by Franklin  Earthmoving Inc. This project will take one  year to complete and will greatly improve  traffic flow in the northern part of Bernalillo  County. Eubank will soon be 4 lanes all the  way to Paseo Del Norte with new frontage  roads, sidewalks, traffic signalization, trail  improvements and storm drainage added. You  can follow the progress of the Eubank Blvd.  expansion on the web at  <www.bernco.gov/eubank>.        The Coalition of District 4 Neighborhood  Associations had a very informative meeting  on August 18th at the Sibrava Sheriff's  Substation. A very thorough and interesting  presentation was made by Chris Blewett on  the New Mexico RailRunner. The next  District 4 Neighborhood Coalition meeting is  scheduled for Wednesday, November 3rd.  For  information about this important meeting  please contact my assistant Darrell Dady at  468-7010.       In October, we will be dedicating the MDC  Sewing Initiative at the Metropolitan  Detention Center as inmates will begin  making their own uniforms and all textiles in a  new 2500 square foot building adjacent to the  jail, that was just constructed. This project is  expected to save taxpayers hundreds of  thousands of dollars each year while giving  inmates worthwhile job skills, teaching them  responsibility and improving their self-worth.   The next programs I am championing at the  MDC will involve inmates raising their own  vegetables hydroponically and growing  Tilapia in large fish tanks to reduce the  county’s cost of feeding inmates.       During the summer Bernalillo County re- opened the newly improved swimming pool at  the Paradise Hills Community Center and also  unveiled a new Splash Park at the Raymond  G. Sanchez Community Center to better serve  my constituents in the far North Valley and on  the West side.        Our Economic Development Team has  been very involved in bringing more Movie  and Television Production to our County and  they are also very excited about hosting the  "Taste of New Mexico" (www.the  tasteofnewmexico.com) Event at 1 Civic Plaza  - October 8th and 9th.  This event, in  conjunction with the City of  Albuquerque, will highlight many area  restaurants featuring their “food, wine and  brew”. You are invited and encouraged to  attend what will hopefully become an annual  event.        Perhaps the most exciting news is that I  now have $50,000 to award as I will be  soliciting proposals from all of the  neighborhood associations in my district  asking them to submit a proposal as to how  they would best use these funds. A committee  will soon be established to review these  proposals and the money will be awarded -  either $50,000 to one Neighborhood  Association or divided among several winning  associations.        Despite the downturn in the economy,  Bernalillo County Government continues to be  well-managed and enjoys the highest bond  rating possible.  At a time when the City of  Albuquerque had to cut employee salaries -  we have just provided 2% raises to all  Bernalillo County Employees and have a  balanced budget. New Ethics Legislation is  being discussed now and the County  Commission is taking steps to eliminate  nepotism and to improve the management of  the MDC (Metropolitan Detention Center)  which costs $71 million a year to operate) and  MATS (Metropolitan Assessment and  Treatment Services) both of which have been  in   The GRIT, Oct 2010                                                                                                             Insert  the news lately.

If you have any  questions regarding the changes please  email us at sandiaheights@comcast.net. The  following amendments will be voted on  individually at the June 2011 Annual  Meeting.     AMENDMENT #1 –To Bylaws Section  7.1.3   change the first sentence, which currently  reads:   7.1.3 Directors’ Participation on  Committees:  All Directors except for the  President shall serve on at two (2)  Standing Committees.     To read: All Directors except for the  President shall serve on at least one  Standing Committee.      Rationale:   PROS: The number of Directors specified  by the Bylaws is sufficient to populate the  Standing Committees with the required  number of Board members if each Board  member serves on one Standing Committee.   Board members are free to serve on more  than one Standing Committee if they desire.  CONS: None are known.     AMENDMENT #2 - To Bylaws Sections:  7.2.4, 7.2.5 and 7.2.7,   change the first sentence which currently  reads:  7.2.4 Covenant Support Committee. The  Covenant Support Committee (CSC) - shall  consist of a minimum of five (5) Board  members, excluding ex officio members.  For each Unit in Sandia Heights for which  CSC has responsibility, the Board authorizes  it to take necessary and appropriate actions  to enforce the Unit covenants as set forth in  its charter, as well as other functions as may  be set forth in its charter.   7.2.5 Community Service and Membership  Committee. The Community Service and  Membership Committee shall consist of a  minimum of three (3) Board members  excluding ex officio members. It shall be  responsible for activities which enhance a  sense of community and perform such other  duties and functions as set forth in its  charter.  7.2.7 Parks and Safety Committee. The  Parks and Safety Committee shall consist of  a minimum of three (3) Board members  excluding ex officio members and shall be  responsible for overseeing park issues,  working with Bernalillo County on traffic,  road and safety related matters such as  proper visibility along roadways, making  recommendations to the Board and  appropriate legislators, and such other duties  and functions as are set forth in its charter.    Change the first sentence of each to read:  “shall consist of a minimum of two (2)  Board members.”      Rationale:  PROS: The changes detailed above bring  consistency to all committees with regard to  the number of committee members required  to be Board members. CONS: None are  known.     The GRIT, Oct 2010                                                                                                              Page 7              Architectural Control  Committee -- The Neighborhood  Review Process       The ACC processes over 300  applications a year ranging from new home  construction and modifications to existing  homes to small projects such as trim  painting. All of these projects are evaluated  prior to their approval to make sure they  conform to Unit covenants and ACC  guidelines. In some cases, the ACC will  conduct a neighborhood review of the  project as part of the evaluation process.  This decision is made when the ACC feels  that the project may have an impact on the  views, harmony, property values, or interests  of the owners of nearby properties.    So how does the neighborhood review  process work? The process consists of the  following steps:  1.  A notification letter is sent to neighbors  in the immediate vicinity of the proposed  project.   2.  The letter describes the project and  advises addressees that they have 10 days to  come to the SHHA office to review the  project plans. These plans normally consist  of a plot plan showing the footprint of the  project, elevation drawings, samples/specs  for exterior materials, colors, and finishes,  and landscape plans.  3.  Once all comments are received, the  ACC provides feedback to the project  applicant and works with the applicant to  address the comments.   4.  If the ACC feels that the comments  expressed during the review process indicate  that there is a feeling of uneasiness with the  project within the neighborhood, the ACC  will schedule a neighborhood review  meeting to allow neighbors to meet with the  ACC.  5.  Once the ACC has received all comments  from the neighborhood review letter and  from any subsequent meetings, the ACC  will consider all of these comments before  making a final decision to approve or  disapprove the project. The ACC will  inform all parties of the decision.  The neighborhood review process is the  product of many years of experience in  dealing with the community’s need to  continually build, update, and modify its  residences. The ACC was established by the  Unit covenants at their inception to provide  overall guidance to the homeowner and to  maintain control of the various architectural  standards imposed by those covenants. The  neighborhood review process was an  outgrowth of the need to have meaningful  neighborhood input as a vital part of the  ACC’s decision process instead of having a  process which did not consider the impact of  a project from the neighborhood’s point of  view.                   ANNOUNCEMENTS &  NOTICES:    • Office hours: Monday –  Friday, 9am – 4pm.   • Office Closed on Monday,  October 11 in observance of  Columbus Day.  • Tram passes, Classified ads,  Contractor Evaluation  Binder, Notary & Office  services (fax – copies) free to  members.  • Tree Lottery Program for  members       The GRIT, Oct 2010                                                                                                         Page 8  ACC Activity Log   The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.

This format is supported  by Adobe-Reader 9. Adobe-Reader 9 software can be downloaded free of charge (how to do this  will be outlined later in this article.) Adobe is the industry standard and is used by the courts and  government to generate all computer generated documents.  All our residents, SHHA members and non-members, receive the monthly GRIT newsletter  in the mail. Some of our residents ignore the mailed GRIT and only read the GRIT online. The  online GRIT is in color and in the near future will incorporate audio and video to supplement our  printed articles. While there is NO intention of discontinuing the printed mailed out version of  the GRIT, some of our residents want to have the online GRIT and cancel the mailed printed  version. This is consistent with the trend to reduce the harvesting of trees for paper and to avoid  the unnecessary cost of inks, printing and postage.   If you do decide to cancel your mailed GRIT, an adult household member need only email  the SHHA office at sandiaheights@comcast.net with your name and address and request to be  taken off of the GRIT mailing list. Any time you wish to return to receiving the printed mailed  GRIT, you may do so, again via an email requesting to be added to the mailing list.  Almost all personal computers have Adobe-Reader installed. If yours does not, go to the  internet and do the following: 1. Go to Adobe.com, then double click on the “get Adobe Reader”  button. 2. The next web page will ask you to download Adobe Reader 9.3.4. but, BEFORE YOU  DOWNLOAD, CLICK OFF THE SYMBOL FROM “ALSO INSTALL McAfee.” Follow the  prompts and a free copy of Adobe Reader 9.3.4 will be downloaded to your computer.   To view the October online GRIT, go to sandiahomeowners.org. On the home page, mouse  over to the “news/information” button and then, on the drop down menu, click “GRIT  newsletter”, then click on the “September GRIT”. All of the 2010 GRITs are archived and  available to the user. Check it out, the SHHA website offers a very colorful clear pdf file of our  GRIT newsletter.
