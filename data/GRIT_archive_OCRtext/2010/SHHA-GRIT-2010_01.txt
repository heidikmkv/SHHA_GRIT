  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                         January 2010                           President’s Message   ~ Andy Anderson       A few weeks ago, a Sandia Heights resident  sent a note to our SHHA office describing an  encounter with three bow hunters on her  property. The hunters were in camouflaged  clothing with bows in hand. When our  resident approached them to ask them what  they were doing and advised them that they  were on private property, their response was  that they were hunting and implied they had  every right to do so since the property was not  posted. Our homeowner called Sandia  Heights Security, however, the group was out  of the area before security could arrive.      In an effort to gain insight into a situation  such as this, we asked Ed Whitten, a former  SHHA President and bow hunter, for some  advice for our residents. Ed’s comments are  as follows:  Residents of Sandia Heights should be  aware that deer hunting (with a bow and  arrow) is allowed in the National Forest  which borders our neighborhood. There  was a Youth (under 18) hunt from  November 21 through November 29.  There is also a regular adult hunt in 2010  from January 1 through January 15. Each  hunt is limited to 50 hunters and the  authorized area of the Sandia Mountains  is a very large area. However, there are  occasional hunters who access the  National Forest through our  neighborhood. Most all hunters are very  courteous and aware that they must use  recognized access points to park or enter  the hunt area. If necessary hunters should  be reminded of the following rules as  stated in the New Mexico Big Game &  Trapper Rules & Information:  “Sportsmen must get written landowner  permission to cross private land where no  public access exists to get to the public  land.”      Although this incident was isolated and  unique, residents should remain alert for  anyone crossing their property without  permission and notify Sandia Heights  Security and the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s  office as appropriate. Living in Sandia  Heights is a true privilege and our property  rights must be respected if we want to  maintain our unique community.     SHHA would like to wish you all a  prosperous and healthy new year. The Board  and staff look forward to continuing to serve  and represent all of our members in 2010.    MAIL THEFT    Mail theft is still a problem!  We advise that you take  your outgoing mail to the  Post Office. Last month  mail was stolen from mailboxes during the  night hours from 15 different residences. If  the option is available it might be best to have  sensitive information like checks, insurance  and mortgage papers sent to your bank branch  and you can pick them up from there, rather  than having them sent to your house.  Likewise, consider opening a post office box  and have your mail sent there. Otherwise,  keep your eye out for the postman and get  your mail out of your box quickly. The closest  collection box is at the Circle K office. Pick- up time is 4pm Mon-Sat.  The GRIT, Jan 2010                                                                                                                    Page 2  SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES  Sandia Heights Services would like to remind  all residents that trash (including recycling)  must be out no later than 7am on the  scheduled pickup day, or no earlier than  5pm on the evening prior to collection.    White Roofs in Sandia Heights  from the ACC       The Architectural Control Committee  (ACC) is assigned the task to ensure  compliance with the covenants that pertain to  the exterior appearance of the properties  within the Units of Sandia Heights. One of the  covenants that uniformly applies to all Units  is the prohibition of white roofs. Some of  these covenants were established as far back  as 1965 when energy savings was of little  concern.      Over the past two years, the ACC has  received a number of requests for the  installation of roofs that are made of relatively  new materials known as "cool roof" materials  that allow a reduction of up to 50% in energy  requirements to cool a house. This is  especially true for flat roofs and, of course,  would be a major benefit to home owners in  warmer climates including Sandia Heights.      Many of these new materials are available  in several colors including white and tan. The  white materials are promoted by local roofing  companies because of ready availability and  their high solar reflectance.     However, as stated above white roofs are  against the covenants in the Units of Sandia  Heights and, therefore, cannot be approved by  the ACC.     The ACC has studied this "white roof"  dilemma of energy savings versus the fact that  white roofs are prohibited by the covenants,  and proposes the following solutions.                                       1.  The ACC will approve roofs with a Solar  Reflectance (SR) or a Light Reflectance  Value (LRV) of 65 or less. Where white  roofs have a LRV or SR of more than 80,  a tan roof 65 and a tar and gravel roof 10.  The energy saving varies little between a  SR or a LRV of 80 and 65. According to  studies published by the Lawrence  Berkley National Laboratory, the energy  savings of a tan roof (SR = 65) is only 4  % less than a white roof (SR = 80) and  still qualifies for the Energy Star label as a  "cool roof", as defined by the USDOE.   2.  The ACC will consider the visibility of a  roof surface from neighbors in  determining the acceptance of a roofing  material. Roof reflectance should never  influence neighbors in a negative manner.  3. Roofs that are not visible from the roads  or visible by the neighbors and are  screened by parapets can have a SR or LR  value of more than 65 but not more than  80.  4.   At all times the ACC will require that            for conventional roofing material (e.g. tar         and gravel) the insides of the parapets will        be painted or stuccoed in a color scheme         in harmony with the outside walls of the         home. If a membrane material is used, the         inside upswing of the parapets shall be        covered with a low reflectance membrane         material of tan or other darker color.   5. The ACC will not approve a high gloss  finish that has the potential of reflecting  nuisance levels of light into nearby  properties. Gloss is a measure of the  degree to which a surface functions as a  mirror. The ISO and ASTM specular gloss  scales include <10 = flat (matte, velvet),  10-20 = eggshell, and >85 = high gloss.  Finishes with a flat, eggshell or low sheen  designation (gloss value of <20) are  usually acceptable.

For those who may be new to the  neighborhood this is a reminder that our  roads are OWNED and MAINTAINED by  Bernalillo County. Your homeowners  association has absolutely NO authority to  do anything about the roads when they are  totally iced over.     The county policy for bad weather is: “The  most heavily traveled roads are prioritized  first. As an example in the Sandia Heights  area, Eubank and Paseo Del Norte would be  a priority because of the number of cars that  use it.” In talking to them there really is no  time schedule and they usually work the  storm as it develops. This being the policy,  the best advice is to stay home the morning  after a storm, if at all possible, safe and  warm, until the ice on the streets begin to  melt and it is safe to travel.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders  • Walk Facing Traffic; make eye contact  with drivers approaching you.  • Wear reflective vest or brightly-colored  clothing, particularly in the evening.   • If you are walking a dog, keep the dog to  your left.  • Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single file.                 The GRIT, Jan 2010                                                                           Page 4        Officers  President – Andy Anderson  Vice President – Phyllis Moore  Secretary – Frances Desonier  Treasurer – Ed Tull    Board Members  Phil Abshere  Bob Bower  Bruce Childs  Larry Desonier  Kate Fry  Pete Heinstein  Jim Irving  Michele Munson  Burt O’Neil  Melissa Puckett  Mona Lee Schilling  Marsha Thole  Dick Wavrik  Mike Winokur    Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrative Assistant       SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  WEBSITE:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  EMAIL:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org      GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Attempt to publish both  sides of every issue,  including constructive  criticism; no abusive or  insulting remarks.   Reserve the right to edit any  submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.
