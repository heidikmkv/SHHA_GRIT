    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                     April 2009    President’s Message ~ Sy Caudill    Spring Time and Water       As I sit writing this today, we are getting  our first precipitation of the year, anticipated  to be about a quarter of an inch. While this is  good news, the bad news is that we recently  went 70+ days without rainfall. With an  average annual rainfall that is not much more  than 8 inches, we do not expect too much and  all of us greatly appreciate the rain when it  does come.        However, all of us expect to turn on our  water taps and have fresh pure clean water  anytime of the year.  Have you ever  considered just where your water comes from  and how it gets delivered to your home?  Our  friends at Sandia Peak Utility Company  (SPUC)  (http://www.sandiaheightsservices.com/spu/in dex.htm ) are our water providers and have  been since the inception of this community.         As many of you know, our water comes  from a deep underground aquifer that  provides us with some of the best water in the  world and with minimum treatment. You can  read about this in the annual report provided  by SPUC. As explained by SPUC  management, our source of water has  remained remarkably stable since the  inception of the utility; however, we need to  be aware that any aquifer may not be infinite.  Albuquerque found that out over the last five  decades and is now converting to river water  as an additional source of their drinking  water, and they have instituted an extensive  water conservation effort as well. Of course  they get even less rainfall than we get  annually, which is the recharge source for  most aquifers in this area. The Rio Grande  may provide some recharge, and Albuquerque  is working with some surface recharge but  most of our water comes from rain. What we  have tapped into with the aquifer is the stored  remains of thousands or millions of years of  rain or snow fall. Lucky for us the Rio Grande  Valley is a continental rift (split) that has  many thousands of feet of gravel below the  surface which makes for extremely good  storage of water! So when you take your  shower or get that glass of water, think of it as  very old and something to be cherished— especially in our semi-arid environment.       Even so, our water is somewhat like the  current situation with oil: we are taking eons  of stored or accumulated product and using it  for our current needs. While oil is most likely  not being replenished at any significant rate,  aquifers are a different story. Most aquifers  are subject to depletion and will fall as  Albuquerque’s has, if the amount withdrawn  exceeds the amount put back into the aquifer  by rainfall.        Now I don’t know about you, but I do like  my cup of coffee and a good hot shower every  day. With that in mind, I began to wonder just  what demands have been placed on the  aquifer that supplies us and how it has fared  over the last couple of decades of use. In  addition, especially since many of us have 30- year home loans, what is the projection for the  next 30 years and what can we do to ensure  that water is still available 30 years from  now? So I turned to the experts and have  asked SPUC to answer some questions and  provide their views on our future supply of  water. The interview will appear in the next  issue of the GRIT.

While we all support the refuse collection,  the other two are voluntary subscriptions,  and they add immeasurably to the  community. I have written on this issue  before and will continue to do so, as the  Security Patrol provides additional  protection for everyone in our community  by just being present and driving around at  all hours of the day and night. However,  they are limited in coverage and equipment  by lack of funding from the community.        I’m asking that each of you review your  bill from Sandia Heights Services to see  whether you subscribe to the Security Patrol.  For those of you not on the service, Sandia  Heights Security is offering free service until  June 1, 2009 as an incentive for you to join  with your neighbors.  If you are interested in  this exclusive offer, please contact Jackie  Sexton at 857-8924. Please consider joining  to allow them the resources they need to  better protect all of us in the community.              WE NEED YOUR HELP  AND SUPPORT   ~ Andy Anderson, Nominating  Committee Chair           The SHHA is a volunteer organization  with the prime objective of maintaining  the unique character and exceptional  living conditions in our community.

These amendments will  be published on the SHHA website by April  17 and available in the office as well  for review. The amendments are being  posted to the website to save postage and  printing costs, which would have been  approximately $3000. To help members  better understand and to answer your  questions, the Bylaws Committee has  scheduled three Q&A sessions to be held at  the SHHA Office on the following dates:      Tues, Apr 21, 10:30-11:30 am  Wed, May 6, 5:30-6:30 pm  Wed, June 3, 11:30 am -12:30 pm           We thank everyone for their suggestions  and input. Come by to meet your Bylaws  Committee members and learn more about  the amendments.              Parks & Safety Committee   ~ Frances Desonier         Hello, Neighbors, Spring is about on us  and we have noted that many of you are out  preparing your lawns and gardens for the  warmer days ahead. We have been very  happy to see that many of you are cutting  back the vegetation from the curbside to  make our roads a little safer for pedestrians.  Good for you!       The last P&SC article printed in the  March GRIT reminded our neighbors about  the dangers of thick vegetation along  driveways. Unfortunately, there are still  many who have chosen to ignore this  potential hazard. PLEASE consider cutting  thick vegetation away from the entrance/exit  of your driveways so that both you and  oncoming cars and pedestrians have better  visibility.       As you know, the County has been  working closely with the P&SC and SHHA  to cut along all roadsides at a 45-degree  angle in order to help improve visibility.  This has helped a great deal, but it does not  solve all problems for pedestrians. We want  to encourage each of you to call the SHHA  office if you note specific areas where either  the chamisa is too overgrown or perhaps  signs are being blocked by trees and  vegetation at intersections. (The county  prefers to have one contact with SHHA for  reporting such nuisance areas.)       It has come to our attention that there  may be increasing instances of vandalism  and break-ins in Sandia Heights recently.  For this reason, the Sheriff’s Office is being  contacted for information and to ask how  SHHA might be able to assist them and our  residents in preventing such instances. We  will keep you posted.       We also want to remind you that the  SHHA office has safety vests for sale that  have reflector strips down the front and  back.  These are sold below cost at $2 for  SHHA members and $4 for non-members. I  am told we have already sold well over 150  such vests!  Go, Neighbors!  Sure hope I  begin to see more of them on pedestrians,  particularly during evening hours.
