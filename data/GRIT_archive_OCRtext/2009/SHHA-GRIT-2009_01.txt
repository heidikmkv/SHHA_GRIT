    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                           January 2009    President’s Message   ~ Sy Caudill    Home for the Holidays?         As you are reading this the holidays are  past and I hope each and every one of you  had an exceptional season--also welcome to  2009! As I walk my dog--or she walks us-- every morning I am reminded of just how  nice a community we have and how lucky  we are to have this jewel overlooking the  valley, with its views to the horizon and the  towering mountains behind--snow covered I  hope!        This is my second and last year as  president, two too many for some I am sure,  and I am a recent transplant I'll admit. I  often get reminded by callers that they have  lived here 20-25-30 years as the case may  be. I try to remember to ask whether they  have volunteered to keep the association  running and are they willing to help out with  whatever the issue is they are calling  about. YOUR association needs your  volunteer help to keep it running and allow  us to maintain the area so we can all enjoy  this exceptional community. Our covenants  are like most other similar communities in  that we have to continually enforce  them and insure that it is always done fairly  and equitably. We enforce all provisions of  the covenants using the volunteers that we  have available on the CSC and the vigilance  of our members. Remember that our process  is not to "police" for violations but to  respond to member reported violations.        Our ACC actively works to interpret the  covenants and provide guidelines that clarify  and implement the covenants to make it  easier for homeowners to do a project  correctly the first time. Both the ACC and  the CSC are doing work that our surveys  overwhelmingly show the membership  wants done--covenant enforcement. Both of  these committees need volunteers to do the  work that our members support and we need  volunteers on the Board of Directors. Our  current dues are $8 and have been for a long  time. That pays for keeping the office  running, producing the GRIT, the Resident  Directory, and all of the benefits of the  association such as the free Tram passes  and coffeehouses.             None of these funds go toward  employees doing covenant enforcement,  maybe we should have hired employees to  do this work, but for now we use volunteers  and your dues are low. Our volunteers keep  our costs to an absolute minimum; but we  must have your volunteer support and we  need it now. As we move into the spring our  ACC requests will increase greatly, as will  our other work. I am asking for your support  by donating your time and energy to keep  our community a desirable place to live. I  got involved in the association as a result of  doing some volunteer work at a community  event and then being asked by Bill Johnson  to join the Board--yes Bill I'm still here-- now it is my turn to ask each of you for your  support--please volunteer your time by  calling the office and offering to give your  association a helping hand.       Happy New Year    from your Board of        Directors and the            office staff.

As Sy Caudill mentioned in his article, many of the planted trees have  reached heights of 30-40 feet. In addition to the tall trees, very invasive, non-native trees have  proliferated in our community. In a drive around the neighborhood, it was noted that many of  these trees actually block the owner’s views of the mountain or city lights. Some obstruct a  neighbor’s view as well. Sy commented that he had several of his trees trimmed “not because  any of my neighbors asked me to—just because it was the right thing to do.” We applaud that  attitude.       In addition to the view issue on large trees, there have been numerous inputs regarding  damage to leach fields and septic systems because of invasive roots. Septic system repairs can be  very expensive, as many of you know. Sandia Services has noticed significant problems in the  water distribution system, which are costly repairs also. These issues cost all of us in the end.       Many people have expressed a desire to have some of their trees trimmed or removed. In an  effort to help facilitate this desire, the Community Services and Membership Committee has  been discussing ways to assist in this effort. One action we plan is to have a professional arborist  come to our next Meet ‘n’ Greet to provide residents with ideas on tree maintenance, as well as  an idea of the cost for trimming or removal. Please plan to attend our next Meet ‘n’ Greet on  March 28, 2009. In addition, the committee is investigating ways to have some of the more  commonly used tree services in our area provide a discounted cost for trimming or removal. The  committee has also considered helping with the cost of such services, if the interest is great  enough. Members who might be interested in assistance of this nature should call our office to let  us know.  The GRIT, Jan 2009                                                                                                                Page 3                 Parks & Safety Committee   ~ Frances Desonier, Chair       Howdy, Neighbors, just a reminder that  the SHHA office has safety vests for sale  that have reflector strips down the front and  back. These are sold below cost at $2 for  SHHA members and $4 for  non-members. I am told we  have already sold nearly  100 such vests! Go,  Neighbors!    We certainly hope to see pedestrians  wearing these vests as they walk our  lovely neighborhood. Know, however, that  our roads really are not designed for  pedestrians, hence the lack of sidewalks or  paths along our roads. So, PLEASE, be extra  cautious as you walk our streets. Please,  wear your safety vest (particularly in low  visibility conditions - like at night or in bad  weather), face traffic and step off of the  road whenever a car needs to pass you by.       As you know, the County has been working  closely with the P&SC and SHHA to  cut along all roadsides at a 45-degree angle  in order to help improve visibility. This has  helped a great deal, but it does not solve all  problems for pedestrians.    The Parks & Safety Committee asks that  each of you clear obstructions from your  property adjacent to streets; clear anything  that would prevent a pedestrian from  stepping off the street and out of the way of  oncoming vehicles. There is already a  county law that specifies that it is the  homeowner’s responsibility to maintain the  first two to three feet of the property that is  along the road. Please clear at least two feet  of space between the edge of the road and  any obstruction or vegetation that would not  allow a walker to safely step off of a road in  order to avoid a dangerous situation.     I sincerely hope that this message finds each  of you healthy and happy. All of us at the  P&SC wish each of you a Happy New Year!                     Covenant Support  Committee ~ Pete Heinstein, Chair         The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) is  charged with following up covenant  complaints filed in the SHHA office by  members of the homeowners association. In  most of these cases the CSC can resolve the  disagreements in an amiable fashion by  discussing the covenants for the respective  units with the alleged violator as well as the  complainant. The CSC refuses to get involved  in neighbor disputes that do not directly  involve alleged covenant violations.  Furthermore, CSC does not “patrol” Sandia  Heights to look for covenant violations           The majority of alleged violations involve  trees blocking views, RV’s and/or trailers  parked on the property, lights shining into  neighbors houses, and complaints about  barking dogs and owners not picking-up after  their pets.         The issue of trees and views produces the  most difficult arguments to resolve. The  covenants in some units clearly spell out that  certain trees are not allowed. However, if such  clear directions are not in the covenants the  CSC attempts to mediate a resolution by  talking with both parties, the complainant and  the alleged violator. Since these complaints  can be looked at as landscaping problems the  CSC works together with the Architectural  Control Committee (ACC) to come up with a  solution.

The world’s longest aerial  tramway, an attraction for visitors from  around the world and located right in our own backyard, has  become a little more accessible to Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association members. Up to 4 round-trip Tram Passes are available  for SHHA members, each day, free of charge! (A $17.50 value for  adults, $15.00 for seniors, $10.00 for kids under 12, for a total  savings of up to $70.00 per day.) Call the office to see how it  works.  The GRIT, Jan 2009                                                                                                               Page 7  Continued from page 3    The covenants for all units in Sandia Heights  state that recreational vehicles, trailers and  boats cannot be parked or stored in the open,  or not shielded from view, on any property in  Sandia Heights. However, the temporary  presence (1 to 2 weeks) of RV’s, etc. for  loading or unloading, is acceptable.            The majority of covenants of the individual  units in Sandia Heights state that “no un- shaded flood lights shall be maintained which  cause light to shine directly into the living  units of any residence….”.   The temporary  activation of security lights set at a 2 to 3  minute cycle is acceptable. The problem arises  with motion activated (security) lights. Due to  the often windy conditions in Sandia Heights  such lights are turned on by movement of  trees, bushes or grass. The CSC recommends  the installation of a cut-off switch to turn off  these lights when windy conditions persist. It  should be mentioned that Bernalillo County  has an ordinance that prohibits the positioning  and use of lights that shine into living areas of  adjoining properties and CSC has referred a  number of complaints to the county for action.         Complaints concerning barking dogs are  referred to the County Animal Control  Department for action. Bernalillo County has  an ordinance that requires dog owners to  clean-up after their dogs. Recent complaints  about excessive dog droppings especially  along the AMAFCA (Albuquerque  Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority)  owned properties but used by many Sandia  Heights residence to walk their pets, has  resulted in the placement of signs in these  areas. The signs, erected by AMAFCA,  remind dog owners to clean-up after their pets.  The County approved a new Animal Control  Ordinance and Fee Structure on 12/9/08  that  goes into effect 6/809. It can be found at  http://www.bernco.gov//upload/images/animal _control/animal_control_ordinance_2008_120 908.pdf.  All owners of Sandia Heights property should  have received a copy of the covenants,  reservations and restrictions upon purchase of  their property. If not, a copy can be  downloaded from the SHHA website or  obtained from the SHHA office. The CSC  hopes that all residents of Sandia Heights  understand that the covenants, reservations  and restrictions have been established and are  enforced by the CSC as benefit for all  residents to maintain the beauty and the  lifestyle in this unique subdivision, as well as  protect property values.                                         Letter to the Editor    ref: Article in GRIT Dec 08 by Burt O'Neil     In the December issue of The GRIT, Mr.  O'Neil spoke to an issue regarding  safety and in the article he makes the  following (good) comment, "For accident  avoidance, both the walker and driver  must see each other in time to take  evasive action." As a resident in SH, I drive  the roads daily so the issue of safety is  always a consideration. I would like to offer  some observations and mention a couple of  ideas/suggestions for anyone using the  roadway for pedestrian use, walking,  jogging, pet exercise, etc.     1. Pedestrians should always walk on the  side of the road facing oncoming traffic;  that would be on the left side of the  road. By doing so both the pedestrian  and the oncoming vehicle operator can  make early eye contact and both help to  avoid any mishaps. It is also true, in  most cases, when an approaching  vehicle operator sees pedestrian/s  walking towards them in the same lane  then the vehicle operator tends to yield  sooner and give pedestrians a wider  berth when passing. This alone reduces  the odds of a mishap by nearly 100%!

Those pedestrians choosing to ignore this  'age-old-advice' and continue to walk in  the middle of the road or in the          right-hand lane with their back/s to  traffic are placing themselves at a severe  disadvantage in the case of a distracted  or careless vehicle operator.  I have  noticed that some of our residents and  guests not only walk with their backs to  traffic but do so while wearing  headphones, exercising their pets or  simply enjoying the scenery! This is a  very dangerous practice in today's  climate of cell-phone users and in  general the fast-paced environment we  live in.                                                                3.   Please, try to remember that using the  'middle of the road' is not advisable  for pedestrians or vehicles on  our roadways here in SH.       Please practice common sense when  walking, running, exercising your pets and  'take-a-walk-on-the-safe-side'!     I am not advocating that vehicles have any  more right to be on the roads than  pedestrians. If we share the road then  perhaps it would be easier if we all were on  the same page and subscribed to some basic,  common sense safety practices.
