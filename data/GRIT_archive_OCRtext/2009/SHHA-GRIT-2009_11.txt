    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                            Nov 2009    HAPPY THANKSGIVING!      Comments from the  President   ~ Andy Anderson         As November approaches, I would like  to put in a plug for the kickoff of the  recycling pilot program by Sandia Heights  Services. Although the homeowner’s  Association is not involved in the  program, it is a major benefit to our  community and SHHA fully supports the  initiative. November also kicks off a new  year of offering Tram passes to our SHHA  members and we have increased the  number of passes available from four to  six per day due to the success of the  program. The passes can be obtained at  our SHHA office and require a refundable  deposit at the time of pick-up.             I am pleased to welcome one of your  SHHA neighbors, Melissa Puckett, as a  new Board member who will also be  serving on the Community Service and  Membership Committee and the Covenant  Support Committee. We thank Melissa for  her service and would welcome more  volunteers to serve on both the Board of  Directors or as volunteers on our  Committees. Please contact our office staff  if you are interested in serving.               Our community continues to be a  unique area thanks to the support of all our  residents and the efforts put forth by our  SHHA committees and volunteers. Your  Board of Directors also continues to work  behind the scenes with the county and our  representatives to focus their attention on  the needs of Sandia Heights for the  maintenance of our roads and to keep our  streets safe.           Your SHHA Board recently met with  Dave Mitchell, the Bernalillo County  Public Works Division Operations and  Maintenance Director. The diligent effort  of our SHHA volunteers has kept us at the  forefront on road maintenance in the  unincorporated areas of the County  through the timely submission and  coordination of our requirements within  the County and State budget process. We  are looking for assistance to augment our  current volunteers in continuing our road  maintenance and improvement efforts.  Any SHHA members interested in helping  out please contact our SHHA office staff.              On behalf of the Board I would like to  wish all of our residents the best for the  upcoming holiday season.

Remember, county  law requires all dogs to remain on a leash  when being walked and that a dog’s  excrement should be picked up by the owner  of that dog.  Also, those individuals that  walk up the Domingo Baca Flood Plain into  the National Forest should realize that this  trail is on private property – and that they  really don’t have permission to walk there.   It is extremely inconsiderate to let dogs run  loose; they run up to houses and get into  other’s dog food, facing off and  antagonizing other’s pets, etc.  Please,  demonstrate courtesy to the home owners  and keep your dog on a leash – after all, it’s  the LAW.     Here is also another reminder that tall  chamisa hanging over our already narrow  streets causes a significant safety hazard.   Homeowners are required to keep brush cut  back in the easement. The county can  actually fine the homeowner and/or trim the  brush and also bill the homeowner for the  trimming.  As a courtesy the county has  agreed to trim the brush back at no charge –  and since many homeowners are letting it  grow tall, the county is getting more  aggressive in cutting it back.  If there are  any areas that you see as a safety hazard,  particularly corners and next to driveways,  please call the SHHA office.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders  • Walk Facing Traffic; make eye contact  with drivers approaching you.  • Wear reflective vest or brightly-colored  clothing, particularly in the evening.   • If you are walking a dog, keep the dog to  your left.  • Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single file.                  HOLIDAY PARTY TIME:        It’s time to book your holiday party at  High Finance Restaurant or Sandiago’s  Mexican Grill for a group of 20 or more.

These are the  buzzwords we hear so often today with our  ever growing concerns as inhabitants of earth  to do what we can to protect our precious  resources.  With curbside recycling being  piloted in our community, Sandia Heights  Services LLC would like to assist our  customers in understanding the recycling  process.  By educating ourselves about the  process of recycling, we hope to make our  curbside recycling program a success!       Recycling is the process of taking a product  at the end of its  useful life and using  all or part of it to  make another  product.  The  internationally  recognized symbol  for recycling  includes three  arrows moving in a  triangle.  Each arrow represents a different  part of the recycling process, from collection  to re-manufacture to resale.  1  Recycling serves two key purposes:  •  It keeps valuable materials, such as  aluminum and paper, out of landfills so  this material can be reused in other  forms and not wasted.  •  It prevents hazardous materials and  chemicals, such as lead and mercury,  from ending up in landfills, where they  can contaminate soil and leach into our  drinking water.2       As part of our curbside recycling pilot  program, it will be important to know what  can and can’t be placed out for collection.  We  will accept the following recyclables, which  should be placed in clear plastic bags  (available at Wal-Mart and Costco).  It is not  necessary to separate the materials, with the                                                               1 Adapted from Earth911.com  2 Adapted from Earth911.com  exception of corrugated cardboard, which  should be flattened and bundled.  •  #1 - #7 Plastic   bottles and jugs,   rinsed and caps   removed-the   recycle symbol   will appear on the   container with a   number in middle   of the symbol if it is recyclable.  •  Phone books, brown paper bags, cereal  boxes, plastic grocery bags, newspapers,  magazines, catalogs, junk mail, home  office paper, aluminum cans, tin/steel  cans.       We are not currently accepting glass or  Styrofoam containers for recycling.  For hazardous wastes such as paint, antifreeze,  cleaning supplies, pesticides, poisons,  batteries, fertilizers, pool chemicals,  fluorescent light bulbs and mercury, you may  contact the City of Albuquerque/Bernalillo  County Household Hazardous Waste  Collection Center at 345-1650 for hours of  operation and information on disposing of  household hazardous waste.       For disposal of used computer hardware,  including printers and scanners, you may  contact New Mexico TechNet at 343-7612.   Their Computer Reruns Program refurbishes  re-usable computers that are then given to  schools and non-profit organizations in New  Mexico.  Broken and outdated hardware such  as non-working monitors, obsolete PC’s and  printers will be recycled in an environmentally  safe manner.       The curbside recycling pilot program  begins on November 2, 2009.  For more  information visit our website at  www.sandiaheightsservices.com or if you  have not signed up for the curbside recycling  pilot program, contact our office at 857-8924  today!  We can all make a difference, one  household at a time, one community at a time,  to have an impact on the world around us!

The County Commission will meet on  October 13th in "closed door session" to  discuss moving forward with the Proposed  Condemnation of the 10 acre Mhoon  Property at Tramway and Paseo Del Norte,  and an updated appraisal is underway.   Bernalillo County has never used its powers of  condemnation to purchase Open Space before  so we would be setting a precedent.  I will  need to get at least three votes from the  Commission and this may be easier said than  done as I must convince my fellow  commissioners that this is a priority for your  neighborhood/my constituents.   Each Commissioner looks to the Open  Space fund to purchase properties in their  districts. We may need you to contact them to  let them know you are paying a heavy  property tax burden and want "your share" of  the pie.    The County's new Weed Abatement  Ordinance which I sponsored is working well  and citations are being issued. If you know of  any properties in the unincorporated area that  have an accumulation or storage of noxious  weeds, litter or just need to be cleaned-up, you  can report these to the Bernalillo County Fire  Marshall's Office at 468-1340.  So far over 50  complaints have been filed with notices sent to  property owners and irregularities have been  mitigated.  Several residents have contacted me  concerning the CVS Pharmacy on Tramway  voicing concerns over the liquor license, and  excessive lighting issues.  I have instructed  staff to address all of your concerns. The  liquor license was issued and our legal staff  informed me that there was nothing they could  do to stop that. We have hired a consultant to  analyze the lighting situation and we should  have a report within two weeks.  The traffic calming efforts (revised speed  hump profiling) have concluded in Sandia  Heights. There is still an ongoing evaluation  with the Stop signs at Deer Trail and Tramway  Lane as it pertains to vegetation and line of  sight. County staff learned a great deal from  this recent exercise and they have now  changed their procedures to require running a  State Statutory Speed Resolution Study on  every road petitioned for traffic calming to  insure that the speed limit study is set  correctly. There was some controversy  concerning the disparities in cost between City  and County speed humps and I can assure you  that I investigated this matter thoroughly and  have all the data in my office.  I am meeting  again this week with Sheriff White to enlist  his help in speed enforcement, so please slow  down and help keep your neighborhood safe!  I heard from some of you, throughout the  summer, about the excessively loud music  emanating from the County Line Restaurant  on Thursdays as they held outdoor concerts  there on those afternoons/evenings.  Because  of these repeated noise complaints and the  lack of a permit process for outdoor music, I  have authored a new Outdoor Concert  Ordinance and permit process which will  soon be presented to the County Commission  for approval.    We now have 125 more parking spaces at  the El Pueblo Rail Runner Station due to my  leadership.  The whistles are silent in the  North Valley as "quiet crossings" have been  installed which I advocated, and the Eubank  Boulevard expansion from San Antonio to  Paseo Del Norte will soon break ground on  schedule as the $25 million project to widen  and greatly improve Eubank moves forward.   Thank you for the opportunity to address  you in this newsletter. If you need my help  with any county issues or want to speak to  me please feel free to contact my assistant,  Annabelle Romero at 468-7010.

Several GRIT articles over  the past year have made these points in  various ways. At recent SHHA Office Open  House Meet ‘n Greets the subject for  discussion has been the care and control of  trees. And at this year’s Town Meeting,  following the SHHA Annual Meeting, a  resident asked what trees should be considered  weeds in Sandia Heights and how can they be  controlled.        According  to  Mr.  Joran  Viers,  horticulturalist for the Bernalillo County  Extension Service, Tree of Heaven and  Siberian Elm should be considered weeds in  Sandia Heights and Siberian Elms are  considered the greater present threat.     Siberian Elm       According to Baker H. Morrow, Best  Plants  for  New  Mexico  Gardens  &  Landscapes,  Siberian  Elm  is  “Almost  supernaturally hardy; thrives in any soil with  little or no water and is not affected by heat or  cold.” They “Can grow to 80 feet in height,  with a 50 foot crown” and “Reseeds itself  profusely in early spring.”       Our covenants restrict houses to 2 stories or  less in order to be in harmony with their  surroundings and so as not to create an undue  obstruction of views. At present, a few  Siberian Elms already tower over 2 story  houses and there are hundreds, soon to be  thousands, of Siberian Elm saplings rapidly  growing to join them. It would be prudent for  all of us to be aware of this condition and to  consider effective actions to control this  growing threat to our views and quality of life.       Mr. Viers advises that when removing  Siberian Elm, the trunk should be cut as close  to the ground as possible and the stump treated  with an herbicide. (Untreated stumps and roots  will sprout new saplings.) He recommends the  use of Garlon - 4 to treat the stump. The threat  constituted by the proliferation of Siberian  Elm is one of the very few instances he  believes where the use of an herbicide is  justified. Garlon-4 can be purchased at Rocky  Mountain Pool & Agriculture and applied to  the freshly cut stump at any time during the  year.  Siberian Elm 2-3 years old           The Siberian Elm invasion in Sandia  Heights in many ways is comparable with the  Salt Cedar invasion of the Rio Grande Bosque.  The salt cedar invasion was allowed to  continue far too long. It is now costing  enormous amounts of money and effort to rid  the Bosque of this weed. If you have Siberian  Elm seedlings on your property it would be a  lot easier to remove them now rather than deal  with them later after they have become very  large trees.     Siberian Elm 10-12 years old  The GRIT, Nov 2009                                                                                                         Page 8  ACC Activity Log        The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.    16 Juniper Hill Loop – Stucco.
