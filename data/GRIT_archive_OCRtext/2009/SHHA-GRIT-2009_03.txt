    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                           March 2009    President’s Message ~ Sy Caudill    Frostbite and Survivors         My wife asked me in mid January why our  front porch light, which is motion sensitive,  was going on and off in the evenings. Being  one to always have answers I told her it was  the wind. That lasted for a few days until I  noticed that it was happening in the early  mornings as well. One morning I caught a  glimpse of a dark shape moving across our  porch. I paid greater attention—which I  should have done earlier—and low and  behold it was a cat. Turns out it was living in  the heavy evergreens in front of our home.   My wife took over from there and began to  put out food and water in an attempt to  approach the shy and reclusive feline.        Let me digress for a minute to discuss our  environment and domesticated animals.    Most of you have seen the pictures or have  actually seen bobcats and coyotes feasting on  the rabbits and birds. I have had a very large  owl enjoy rabbit meals on the roof of our  home. As I’ve mentioned before, we have had  a bear in our backyard and Sandia Heights  Security has had reports of cougars near the  Tram. We have a very diverse and active  natural environment, which is one of the great  features of this great community that we call  home. It is one of the prime reasons we  selected this to be our home and I’m sure that  is true of a lot of others who live in Sandia  Heights. We and our domesticated pets enjoy  this environment from the security and safety  of our homes. The animals living off the land  have survived by being resourceful, clever  and successful over an extended period. How  they manage with a lack of water, sub 20-  degree temperatures and limited vegetation  for food is beyond me—but they have  survived and prospered. Quite the opposite is  true for the domesticated animals that escaped  or have been “released” into this environment.    They are accustomed to having dinner served  up in a bowl and a warm place to sleep. They  have neither the skills, nor the endurance, to  survive long, and most will likely become  dinner for one of the predators that I  mentioned earlier.       I am hopeful that the signs we all have  seen posted for “lost” pets ended happily but,  in at least two instances I know of, that was  not the case. I would encourage each of you  to take a look at your pet sleeping quietly by  your side and imagine that cat or dog fending  for itself—against the pack of eight coyotes  that I had in my driveway early one morning.   Take a few minutes to consider how they  could “escape” your home and take  preventive steps. Do you let your dogs “out”  for a free romp in the neighborhood? I know I  have seen some that appear to get released on  a regular schedule; maybe you should  reconsider. I have no knowledge of, but have  heard discussions of people “dumping” pets— I hope that is not the case, but I can’t rule it  out. Take a few minutes to consider how you  might avoid your pet’s facing the life the cat  under our evergreens faced.       Oh, the cat—now Sally—yes, my wife was  successful and a couple of very gracious  neighbors helped Sally. She was obviously a  pet at one time, previously spayed, no  diseases, but a bit underfed. She had frostbite  on her ears, nose and paws from the 15- degree temps.

Without our  views SH would just be another ordinary  residential area.            Many homes, and the landscaping that  goes with them, are well over 25 years old.  Before the development of SH, the area was  used to graze cattle. This allowed for the  growth of various native grasses. After the  disastrous drought of the 1950s, the land  was zoned for homes. Shortly after, the  famous Sandia tram was constructed, and  lots were sold and homes constructed. The  lots had some grass and picturesque rock  formations and incredible views. The large  lots and forever views were the selling  points used by the developers. The old- timers tell of seeing the San Francisco  Mountains in Arizona from the top of the  Sandia Mountains.           Many of us planted bushes and trees and  put in landscaping consistent with desert  conditions. Some varieties of trees over time  grew well over the maximum 25 feet current  policy. The current landscaping policies,  based on our covenants, can be found on the  SHHA website. Go to the internet and type  in “sandiahomeowners.org”. Then click on  the Architectural button and then the  Landscape button. One can read about  acceptable tree types and other useful  landscaping information.             The point I hope to make is that SH  owners have done an amazing job of  beautifying the landscape surrounding their  homes, but it is time to consider some  pruning and even tree removal.        Figure 1 shows a large pine tree that  currently blocks a homeowner’s view of the  Sandia Mountains. The picture is taken from  their patio. This tree is more than 22 years  old. Figure 2 is a Photoshop image rendered  so as to remove the tree to allow one to  evaluate the recovered view. This simulates  the effect of the tree removal. The result is  striking and allows for a full vista view of  the mountains.     Figure 1: a large pine blocking   a view of the Sandia Mountains.        Figure 2: Photoshop rendering depicting   the restoration of the spectacular view of the  mountains after the large tree is removed.   The outline of the tree is purposely left   in the scene to orient the viewer.    The GRIT, March 2009                                                                                                         Page 8  Parks & Safety Committee   ~ Frances Desonier    Howdy, Neighbors!         As I write this article, it looks like winter  has returned to our neighborhood once  again. It has snowed off and on for the past  couple of days, yet there is still only a small  accumulation of snow on the ground.  How  fortunate we are in Albuquerque that the  snow stays on the mountain where it belongs  and not long on our roads.       We are pleased to announce that SHHA  has now sold 150 reflective safety vests!   Way to go, Neighbors! Although our supply  is currently depleted, more will be ordered  and available for sale at the SHHA office at  the price of $2 for members and just $4 for  non-members. As you know, reflective  safety vests are particularly effective at  making pedestrians visible to drivers at dusk  and during the evening hours. Several of you  have already been seen wearing them.   Fantastic!       It is also important to walk facing  traffic, making eye contact with drivers as  they approach you. Although more and more  neighbors have been seen doing just that,  there are still a few of you who walk facing  the same direction as the cars in your lane.   Remember, making eye contact with  approaching drivers assures that drivers are  aware that you are in their lane. In addition,  please walk in single file, especially during  peak traffic hours (7-9AM and 4-6PM).       Drivers, please, be vigilant when driving  our roads and do not speed. We are working  diligently with the county to improve  visibility, but nothing can take the place of  due vigilance. Also, be particularly careful  at dusk.        We also need to remind our homeowners  to maintain curbside property. By law, each  homeowner is responsible for doing so, and  our county has agreed to help us out by  trimming vegetation along our roads at a 45- degree angle to improve visibility for both  pedestrians and drivers. Please, also take  particular note of any bushy vegetation  along the edge of your driveway.   Overgrown vegetation often makes it  difficult, if not impossible, to see low-riding  cars when they are exiting private drives.       The P&SC wants to acknowledge the  good works of Marty and Dave Evans.   They have initiated their own “Neighbors  Helping Neighbors” campaign by assisting  other homeowners along their cul-de-sac by  trimming overgrown vegetation. Thank you  for being such good neighbors! Hopefully,  their good example may encourage more of  us to do similar neighborly acts. (Just be  sure you check with the homeowner before  you begin any such project.)       Hope to see many of you at our next  Meet ‘N Greet at the SHHA office on March  28th.                   ACC Activity Log     The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.      140 Big Horn Ridge – Replace doors &  windows.
