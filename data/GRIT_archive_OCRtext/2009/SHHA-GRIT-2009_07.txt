    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                             July 2009    President’s Message   ~ Andy Anderson       As your new president, I would like to  express my gratitude for the large turnout at our  SHHA Annual Meeting and the Town Hall  Meeting. The numbers really exceeded our  expectations, with 90 families attending. Your  SHHA Board of Directors and volunteers  worked hard to provide you with a meaningful  and professional meeting, which went off  without a hitch. We had to call in reinforcements  to add to the food and I think everyone got their  fill in spite of the electrical breaker issue with  the coffee pots.        For those who were not able to attend, I  would like to take this opportunity to introduce  you to your new officers and board of directors  for 2009 – 2010. Your new Vice President is  Phyllis Moore, who joined the board last year.  Phyllis accepted the challenge to chair a new  committee, Community Relations Committee,  that provides a direct interface between SHHA  and our county and state representatives and  government decision makers, ensuring our  Sandia Heights desires and needs are  communicated and understood. Ed Tull has done  an excellent job as Treasurer last year and has  volunteered to continue to serve as your  Treasurer this year. Ed also serves as the chair of  the Finance Committee. Your new Secretary is  Frances Desonier who has been an active board  member for several years. Frances also serves as  the chair for Parks and Safety Committee.      We have two board members that have  fulfilled their terms and are not returning this  year. Your past president, Sy Caudill, served as  your board president for the past two years and  provided the leadership that brought several new  benefits to the membership and community. Sy  will be a tough act to follow and I will call on  him in the future for sage guidance. We also lost  Kerney Bolton who has led the Architectural  Control Committee (ACC) for the past six years  and has streamlined our guidelines, processes  and procedures enabling your ACC requests to  get through the system faster with a more even- handed approach. They will both be missed and  I thank them both for their service to the  Association and our SHHA community. I am  pleased to announce that we have three new  board members to help fill in the gap. Larry  Desonier returns to the board after sitting out for  about a year. Larry previously served on the  Board for six plus years and we welcome him  back. Also, we are adding two new volunteers to  the Board, Dick Wavrik, who served as a  volunteer on the Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) last year, and Michele Munson. We  welcome all of them to the Board of Directors.  In addition to the Board and volunteers, I would  like to recognize our dedicated and professional  office staff, Sheraz and Betsy, who keep us out  of trouble and serve as your immediate day to  day interface to the Association. They are there  every day to assist in any way they can and  answer your questions and I strongly  recommend you call upon them as needed.      Your Association is here to support you and  the community in retaining the unique  environment we all enjoy and take for granted.  However, we really do need more volunteers,  both on the Board and to serve on Committees,  to keep us a viable organization. Our bylaws  require fourteen board members to conduct  business, and with our three new volunteers we  have a grand total of fifteen, just on the ragged  edge to accomplish our mission. I would again  encourage each of you to consider helping the  Association in whatever capacity you can to take  the burden off of the handful of volunteers who  are doing the work for Sandia Heights  community. Two committees which are really in  need are the ACC and the CSC, however,  volunteers for any committee will not be turned  away. If you would like to serve, please contact  Sheraz or Betsy and they will take it from there.  I look forward to serving you in the coming year  and my goal is to continue to make Sandia  Heights a community you want to come home  to.

In response to the question, the SHHA has a 5 year contract with the SHS, which in addition to  collecting the monthly dues, they also will print and insert up to nine “SHHA bill stuffers” per  year with their water bills. The current monthly cost is $1,594, which is subject to no more than a  5% increase per yearly renewal.     Since there is an average of 1650 SHHA members per month, the cost of SHS equates to less  than $1 per month per member.                             Did you know that Bernalillo County has a noise ordinance?      For complaints regarding noise, (e.g., from homes, cars, motorcycles, restaurants and other  businesses, etc.), you can call the Environmental Health Office at   314-0310 and County Commissioner Michael Wiener at 468-7010. For  car/motorcycle racing up and down Tramway Blvd, also call the non- emergency number for the Sheriff at 768-4160. Often, when it is a neighbor  who is causing the noise, it helps to make a polite request to that person to  resolve the problem. Subscribers to Sandia Heights Security can call the  mobile patrol to check loud parties, but all other complaints need to go to the  Sheriff's Office or as noted above.

The hearing officer ruled in  favor of the CVS liquor license over the  objections of 15 Sandia Heights residents.                A Note from Your  Architectural Control  Committee (ACC)     Are you planning a home improvement  project soon? If it will change the exterior  appearance of your property, you must submit  an application to the ACC.  Please make sure  that your application is completely filled out  and submitted in a timely manner; so that the  Committee can do its job for you as quickly as  possible.      It is important that you understand the  covenant restrictions on your property before  you plan a project. As a first step in planning  your project, you need to read your covenant  and the applicable ACC design guidelines.  Both are available in hard copy at the SHHA  Office or on the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org. Most disapprovals by  the Committee could be avoided if these steps  were taken first.     The ACC processes between 300 and 400  applications per year. Approximately one-half  of these applications are to replace roofing,  windows and doors or to re-stucco. The ACC  usually processes these within a week.  However, projects such as new house  construction and additions, walls and fences,  landscaping, and planting trees sometimes  take up to a month to process after all the  required information is received. If your  project is like one of these, please take extra  care to see that the ACC gets the information  it needs and that you will be available to meet  with an ACC volunteer to walk your property  and explain the project. These projects usually  require a plot plan that shows the location of  your house and project relative to your  property lines and either drawn to scale or  carefully dimensioned. The plot plan that you  received with your deed is a good starting  point. The ACC cannot begin to process your  application until these application steps are  completed.       Please do not ask the Committee to expedite  your application so your contractor “can start  your project next week.” The Committee  works very hard to handle your application in  a fair and professional manner and needs  adequate time to do its job. Starting a project  before you receive the written approval of the  ACC is a violation of your covenant and puts  you and your contractor at risk if the  Committee is unable to approve part or all of  your project. With a little advance planning  and the timely submittal of your application,  you can avoid these difficulties.     Remember, the ACC encourages you to  have the ACC look at your project in the early  planning stages to check for covenant  compliance. Please take advantage of this  service if you have any doubts and avoid  future problems. A little advance planning will  go a long way to improve your experience  building your project and your future  enjoyment of it!

Hope all of you are  enjoying our beautiful surroundings this  summer. It was such a joy to see so many  familiar faces at our annual meeting last  month.       This article is just going to be a reminder  about many of the safety topics the P&SC has  been promoting for the past couple of years.  As you know, the county has been wonderful  about trimming the edges of our roads, which  has increased visibility for our pedestrians and  drivers. However, we must remember that it is  the homeowners responsibility to maintain the  easement.     Please trim tall bushes on either side of your  driveways and along the roadside to increase  the visibility of cars entering and exiting your  drive, particularly for low profile cars, and to  allow a space for walkers to step off of the  road when danger approaches. We are aware  that many of you have been trimming the  easement yourselves and it is beginning to  make a real difference in our community.   Thank you! If you are unable to maintain your  curbside yourself or want to report particularly  dangerous spots for drivers or walkers in our  community, please don’t hesitate to contact  the SHHA office at 797-7793.      We have also recently become aware of  problems emergency responders and visitors  sometimes experience when trying to find  addresses of homes in our community. Many  street signs are incorrectly oriented or are in  poor repair and many home address numbers  are not easily visible from the road. In  addition, although most of our fire hydrants  are now clearly marked by brown posts with  blue tops (the international sign for fire  hydrants), there are still a few that remain  hidden. This is a potential danger in case of  fire! Please take the time to walk or drive by  the nearest fire hydrant to your home and  report it to SHHA if it not clearly marked or  cannot be easily seen from the street.      The P&SC is also happy to report that we  sold another dozen or so reflective vests at our  annual meeting. While these vests may not be  needed when walking our streets during the  day, they become particularly important  during evening hours when daylight begins to  fade and visibility is decreased. We will  continue to have these safety vests available in  the SHHA office for purchase at a mere $2 for  members and $4 for nonmembers.     The P&SC also wants to commend those  neighbors who have been more conscious  about the speed of their cars on our roads.   The county has been very diligent about  conducting speed studies to determine safe  speed limits and have installed speed bumps  where it was felt they were needed. It is our  responsibility as good neighbors to be aware  of and to obey the posted speed limits and   to be vigilant in watching for pedestrians and  pets on our roads.      By the way, Mark Chavez, (Cell#: 934- 6367), of the Bernalillo County Parks and  Recreation Dept, has notified SHHA that there  will be improvements made to Little Cloud  Park this summer. They will be replacing the  playground equipment with new equipment of  roughly the same size and will install swing  sets, replace most of current sand with  engineered wood and add a few adult exercise  stations (like sit-up bench, etc.) He would like  input from interested homeowners regarding  the selection of these improvements. Please  call him as soon as possible to discuss these  matters, as this is a project funded for this  summer.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders  •  Walk Facing Traffic  •  Wear brightly-colored clothing  •  Wear a reflective vest and/or carry a  flashlight while walking at night (avoid  shinning it into eyes of oncoming  drivers).  •  If you are walking a dog, keep the dog  to your left.   •  As cars approach, walk single file and  make eye-contact with the drivers.    Let’s all have a fun and safe summer!  The GRIT, July 2009                                                                                                         Page 8  BEARWATCH Early and mid-summer  is the time the bears have come out of  hibernation, and they’re hungry. This is also  when the mama bears kick out the two-year- olds, who then have to find their own territory.  These young bears often wander into our  neighborhood because they remember where  they have found easy food. Here’s what you can  do to keep bears from becoming habituated and  thus becoming problem bears:  ¾ Keep all garbage in your garage or a sturdy  shed.  ¾ Put garbage out only on the morning of your  trash pickup day.    ¾ Don’t leave pet food outside.  ¾ Bring hummingbird feeders inside at dusk  (and take them inside for the winter in  October).  ¾ Fill bird feeders with only enough seed to  last half the day (better yet, don’t feed the  birds at all for a while).  ¾ If you have fruit trees:  pick fruit as it  ripens, and keep fallen fruit picked up.        Bears are very intelligent. They remember  any place they have ever found food and return  unerringly to it. They know what trash cans and  bird feeders are and will always investigate  them for food. We’re asking all Sandia Heights  residents to be tolerant, understanding, and  proactive. Enjoy the sight of a bear if you  happen to see one, but please don’t do anything  to unintentionally feed them.       Please feel free to call your BearWatch Sandia  Heights Wildlife Steward (Kate Fry, 828-9618)  or BearWatch (Jan Hayes, 281-9282) at any  time if you have questions.              ACC Activity Log   The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.    29 Sandia Heights Drive – Replace windows &  doors.
