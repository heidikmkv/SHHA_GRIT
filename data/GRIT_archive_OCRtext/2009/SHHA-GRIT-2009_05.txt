No 99-4, Sec. 6-56,  require individuals that who their dogs for a  walk be responsible for their four-legged  companion and, therefore, clean up after  their pet. The County ordinance is very  specific in this case and dog owners can be  fined when they don’t follow this ordinance.  We know that most dog owners in Sandia  Heights have a plastic bag along and  immediately clean up. However, for the few  who do not feel responsible, have some  consideration for your neighbors and clean  up after your pet.      With the spring winds comes the problem  with motion-activated lights. Again the  covenants, as well as North Albuquerque  Acres and Sandia Heights Light Pollution  Ordinance, Bernalillo County Code, Chapter  30, Article VI, specifies that any light that  shines into a neighbor’s residence is illegal  and can be “... punished by a fine not  exceeding $300.00 per day of the  violation…” Please, be considerate of your  neighbors and turn off these lights manually  when windy conditions persist. The CSC  will transfer all light complaints to the  County for action.           Community Service &  Membership ~  New Swim  Pass  Your Association has  made arrangements  with the Four Seasons Club to purchase a  limited number of passes for members to the  swimming pool this summer. It is hoped that  this program will encourage annual  membership in the Four Seasons Club and in  SHHA.     Each SHHA member family will be  allowed three (3) visits (free passes) for the  summer. Each pass is good for four (4)  family members or guests each visit. Passes  will be available at the SHHA office and  available on a requested date. A limit of 10  passes could be issued on any one day (40  people.)      Unlike the Tram passes, there is no deposit  required; however, members are reminded  that an unused pass will count as one of the  three allowed per family and might also  deny someone else a pass for that day. Other  specific details and rules will be published  soon and available at the SHHA office.     This is another great benefit provided by  your Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association.            Bylaws Committee   ~ Marsha Thole, Chair    Based in part on comments received at last  year's annual membership meeting, the  Board has approved amendments to the  SHHA Bylaws, and seeks ratification by the  membership at the Annual Meeting on June  6. These amendments are needed to better  manage the Association and to help serve  you, the member, better. You may view  them on the website and in the office.  Posting them to the website has saved us  $3000 in additional postage and printing.       To help members better understand and  to answer your questions, the Bylaws  Committee has scheduled three Q&A  sessions to be held at the SHHA office on  the following dates:               Wed, May 6, 5:30-6:30 pm        Wed, June 3, 11:30 am -12:30 pm         We thank everyone for their suggestions  and input.

The GRIT, May 2009                                                                                                          Page 7  2009 SESSION WRAP-UP   ~ Kathy McCoy, State Representative –  House District 22         We have just concluded a 60-day session  in Santa Fe, and it was unlike any that I  remember.     The 2010 budget was the top priority, but  before we could start that, we had to  structure a solvency package just to get us  through 2009. Facing a $600 million  shortfall meant making both strategic and  dramatic cuts. In the end, we basically  passed a flat budget, counting on the federal  stimulus money to fill in the gaps.         Unfortunately, this is non-recurring money  and by all accounts, next year’s revenues  will be significantly less. The state’s  revenues are primarily dependant on oil and  gas royalties, which are currently as low as  we have seen them for many years, and are  expected to remain in decline at least for the  next few months.     Ethics reform was a major issue this  session and we did make progress. We  fought for and won a battle to install video  and audio of the House and Senate floor  sessions. Conference committees will also  now be open to the public.      Also, we passed campaign contribution  limits, but do not be fooled about this  superficial legislation. Contributions from  non-profits and “527” organizations were  not included in the bill, so the big money  will continue to flow without donor  disclosure. It is a huge hole and one that  effectively negates the purpose of  contribution limits.       Also on the ethics front, the state now has  an independent ethics commission to  oversee elected officials throughout the  state. Members of the public can submit  complaints to the commission, which is  made up of appointees selected by the  Governor and leaders of both legislative  chambers.     One bill of the session would have given  the public access to the state’s budget on a  searchable database. Much has been written  about transparency in government and this  bill would have gone a long way to achieve  that. Unfortunately, it never made it to the  House floor for a vote.     Once again, voter photo ID failed. A group  is taking their case to court so we may hear  more about this in the coming months.       A bill which provides for prevailing wage  rates for all public projects over $60,000 is  on its way to the Governor for his signature.  We do not know what kind of fiscal impact  it will have. One estimate is that the impact  on our roads alone will be $137 million over  the next three years.           What effect it will have on schools,  prisons and other government institutions is  unknown.       The bill to allow concealed carry license  holders to “carry” in certain restaurants was  killed. On the bright side, legislation that  will give the State Engineer oversight over  deep water aquifers is on its way to the  Governor.       TIDDS legislation for SunCal failed twice  after being reconsidered, but the TIDDS for  Winrock passed without debate. The death  penalty was repealed, but permitting  research on embryonic stem cells failed to  pass, as did legislation establishing domestic  partnerships.     Finally, any hope we legislators had of  bringing capital outlay funding home to our  districts was dashed once we got deep into  the budget. Needless to say, it was  disappointing for both legislators and those  who count on state funds for projects.       I’m hopeful we’ll have more optimistic  news later in the year.

It is important to  point out that not all water that meets  federal standards is the same. In some cities,  water that is perfectly safe to drink may  have an unpleasant taste, color or odor. We  are very lucky here in Sandia Heights to  have water that is odorless, colorless and  tastes good.   GRIT:  Just where does our water come  from?  SPU:  Our water comes from an  underground aquifer accessed by wells that  are approximately 800 feet deep just west of  the Sandia Mountains.   GRIT:  When were our supply wells drilled  and how many do you now have in service?  SPU:  Our two main supply wells were  drilled in 1986. These two wells produce all  of the water used by the neighborhoods.    GRIT:  Besides all of Sandia Heights, what  other areas do you supply water to?  SPU:  In addition to Sandia Heights we also  provide water to the Primrose Pointe  subdivision just west of Tennyson.  GRIT:  Do you have plans to further expand  to serve other users from these same wells?  SPU:  Sandia Heights and Primrose Pointe  are pretty much built out. Additional  customers will result from the few remaining  unbuilt lots sprinkled throughout all of the  subdivisions.  GRIT:  What changes have you seen in well  performance due to new wells being drilled  (such as hundreds in North Albuquerque  Acres), wells for the new casino or any other  new wells drilled in the area?  SPU:  We have seen little or no impact to  our wells from other wells drilled in the  area; additionally, we have seen little or no  impact upon these wells from the drought  years of recent experience.  GRIT:  What contingency plans do you  have if the wells were to be contaminated by  accident or damaged by a geological event?         SPU:  We have plans to drill a third well  which would provide redundancy in the  event of a catastrophic well failure. This  third well would not result in any additional  pumping of water beyond what we are  already permitted for and what would be  required for the build-out of these  neighborhoods. Once the third well is  completed we would still only use two of the  three wells at any one time for normal  operations.  GRIT:  Are there needed upgrades in our  now 30- to 40-year old water distribution  system?  SPU:  Yes, we have diligently been  upgrading the system on an annual basis.  This is very important as far as reliability  and also to keep lost water to a minimum.  Our goal is to upgrade system piping,  valves, and fire hydrants before the end of  their useful life.  GRIT:  Who do our members contact when  they have water supply or pressure issues?  SPU:  In the event of any problems,  customers should contact our Customer  Service Representative, Jackie Sexton, at  857-8924.

In the event of an after-hours  emergency please call 888-5336.   GRIT:  How will our water rates be  impacted in the coming years?  SPU:  We are raising rates a little bit at a  time each year in order to avoid rate shock  and to enable us to continue the required  maintenance and upgrades to keep our  aging system reliable and dependable.  GRIT:  What can our residents do to assist  in making sure we have a sufficient water  supply for many years to come?  SPU:  We should all take steps to conserve  water whenever possible. It is mostly  common sense of course. Fix those leaky  toilets and faucets. Don’t leave faucets  running. Use drought resistant plants and  trees. Watch your water bills for abnormal  usage that would indicate a plumbing leak.  Go to www.bernco.gov/water  to see the  county water ordinances that apply to all  residents of Sandia Heights and incentive  programs to help you to conserve water.  GRIT: We would like to thank SPU and  all the employees who provide our water,  garbage and security services. When you  see the employees working in your  neighborhood, please take a moment to  thank them for all the services they  provide our community.          NOTICE:  There is a sign at the corner of  Sandia Heights and Tramway that is in  disrepair. This sign will be removed due to  its bad condition.          A Message from Commissioner  ~ Michael C. Wiener, Commissioner,  Bernalillo County District 4     I am proud to represent you as your  County Commissioner and look forward to  maintaining the rapport and solution- oriented dialogue we have begun. I would  like to compliment you for the interest you  have shown to improve our lives and county  government in Sandia Heights by being an  ACTIVE member of your neighborhood!  The following are news-worthy  improvements in Bernalillo County District  4 that I can report for the preceding month.   Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention  Center Farm Initiative      I have begun a new initiative to create a  “farm enterprise” on fifteen acres of the  Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention  Center (MDC). The farm enterprise will  raise basic vegetables, starter trees, as well  as xeriscape foliage and shrubs (for use at  county facilities to reduce consumption of  water). The purpose of implementing this  farm enterprise is intended to prepare the  inmates at the MDC to re-enter society with  practical work skills and values, as well as  provide a means by which to reduce some  costs associated with feeding these inmates.  Shortly thereafter we will implement a Pig  Farm; the pigs will eat all of the food  discarded every day by the inmates and will  then be a valuable food source. As you  know, one of my key campaign promises  was to address the problems of reducing the  costs of feeding the inmates as well as  lowering the rate of inmate recidivism.

As part of this initiative upper  management staff from our county will be  visiting Maricopa County in Arizona on  April 16 to see firsthand the successes their  Sheriff has had there – including the inmates  work initiative, much cheaper inmate meal  costs and animal integration in jail/inmate  care - all of this resulting in huge tax  savings. I strongly feel that we can modify  and improve the administration of Bernalillo  County inmates by adopting several of  Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s  initiatives.   Speed Humps      A controversial and continuing problem  in our district focuses on the pros and cons  of speed humps, their placement, removal,  value and safety. It is a difficult issue to  referee as there is a close balance between  those who are in favor of speed humps and  those that are not. I have tried to work  closely with all residents who are concerned  with reaching some resolution to the  problem and have responded to hundreds of  phone calls, emails and letters. We will be  having a meeting for Sandia Heights  residents on May 4 at the Church of the  Good Shepherd at 7:30 pm to discuss this  issue and to unveil several proposed  solutions to this ongoing concern as voiced  by many residents of Sandia Heights.   Meeting with our Congressional  Delegation     On March 9 and 10 I was in Washington,  DC with three other Commissioners and the  County Manager. We met with our  Congressional Delegation concerning  Bernalillo County's FY 2010 Federal  Priority Package and our Stimulus Funding  Requests. Together we identified various  funding opportunities and are working with  staff now to secure these much needed  dollars to fund county projects.   Weed Ordinance      After years of living with fire hazards and  other problems regarding excessive  overgrowth of weeds in the North and South  valleys and the East Mountains, I introduced  a new weed ordinance to fine or put liens on  the property of owners who do not comply  with mandatory removal of weed  overgrowth. The ordinance is scheduled to  be approved by the County Commission at  the April 13 meeting. I want to emphasize  that we’re going to give property owners the  opportunity to remove the weeds  themselves. Only as a last resort, if they  don’t comply, they will be fined (up to  $1,000) and/or the county will come in and  remove the weeds and put a lien on the  owner’s property.  Address Numbering of Businesses and  Residences      I have also begun a new aggressive  enforcement campaign to improve  response/time by emergency vehicles which  focuses on the critical need for residents and  businesses to clearly mark their properties  with their address numbers. All too often an  emergency vehicle--law enforcement,  medic, fireman, reaches the emergency site  too late because they could not find the  address they were sent to....and every year  people die needlessly because rescue units  waste valuable time trying to "hunt down"  an address. Last week I drove throughout  Sandia Heights after dark, street by street,  and many homes are NOT properly marked  and address numbers are simply not visible.  PLEASE Mark your homes with large  reflective numbers than can easily be seen at  night; your life may depend upon it!  Thank you for your support. I look forward  to seeing you on May 4.

I will use the  Bernalillo County “Public Works Division”  document as a reference guide. When I  quote this document it will be in quotation  marks. This document is at the SHHA office  and available for review.        The SBA is “that portion of land along the  road between the private property line and  the edge of the paved road or curb.” “The  absence of a sidewalk does not relieve the  County nor the adjoining property owner of  the responsibility to allow safe passage of  pedestrians.” In addition, “Unobstructed  vision for traffic safety shall be strictly and  solely maintained by the property owner.”  Items (g), (h) and (i) on page 4 of the  County document elaborate what constitute  a safety obstruction.     This article addresses removal of hedges,  shrubs, or bushes. The prime culprit is the  Chamisa bush. The bush needs 14 inches of  annual rainfall. Runoff from a roadway  raises our 9-inch average rainfall to the  required 14 inches which allows for verdant  growth of the Chamisa bush. Since we have  no sidewalks, this bush grows nicely in the  SBA.  However, alongside the roadway, the  bush grows high enough to obstruct a  vehicle driver’s view and impede a  pedestrian, creating unsafe conditions.     Cutting away a Chamisa bush is an  arduous task. The county does offer a partial  solution, “The Operations and Maintenance  Department will respond to requests  for…mowing. The width of service ranges  up to 7’ from the edge of the road.” The  county will clean up any cuttings that are on  the roadway and will “on a best effort basis”  clean up in the SBA. If property owners are  not satisfied with the clean-up in the SBA,  they can call 848-1500. Before calling, the  property owner should keep in mind that the  homeowner is responsible for the SBA.      I regularly jog in Sandia Heights and  include a photo here of a roadway that used  to be heavily overgrown with Chamisa  bushes. One notes that on both sides of the  road the Chamisa has been effectively cut  back.    A photo taken after a heavy growth of  Chamisa was cut back by the county.     One last note—while found in abundance  throughout the Southwest, Chamisa is not  native to Sandia Heights. It is a very  invasive form of vegetation, and its roots  have gotten into septic system leaching  fields and contributed to the failure of septic  systems. To permanently remove a Chamisa  bush you should remove its roots several  inches below the surface of the ground or it  will grow back and very quickly, too.
