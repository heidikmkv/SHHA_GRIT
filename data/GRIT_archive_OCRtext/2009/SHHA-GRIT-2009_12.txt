  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                         December 2009        President’s Message ~ Andy Anderson       Being in the midst of the holiday season it  is time to reflect on the joys of living in our  unique, pristine community.  It is also a time  to recognize that others less fortunate look  upon our community as an opportunity to  capitalize on our treasures.  In late October  we had a series of three break-ins by one  group of vandals in one afternoon.   Although they were seen by some  neighbors, by the time Sandia Heights  Security and the Sheriff’s office responded  the trio was out of our neighborhood.   Fortunately, some of our residents had  provided a description of the trio and their  truck to law enforcement and they were  supposedly arrested some time later.  In the  process of notifications to law enforcement,  your SHHA office was also informed and an  email alert went out to all of our members  who have signed up for that service as well  as a notification on our website.      At our SHHA Meet and Greet in  November we were fortunate to have a  deputy from the Sheriff’s office provide an  overview of security within Sandia Heights.   For those in attendance it was an excellent  opportunity to gain insight into ways to  protect ourselves against intruders.  For  those not fortunate enough to hear the  presentation I would like to share some of  those insights.  First, we must remember that  our protection is provided by the Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) and that the  Sheriff’s forces are currently spread fairly  thin due to many unfilled positions.   Secondly, we are fortunate to have Sandia  Heights Security providing a roaming patrol  and they do coordinate their actions with the  Sheriff’s deputies.  If you notice any  suspicious cars or people, don’t hesitate to  call both agencies and alert them to the  situation.  Sandia Heights Security will be  able to respond faster than the Sheriff,  however, if you suspect there is an intruder  in your house and relay this information to  the Sheriff’s dispatcher, the Sheriff’s  deputies will expedite their arrival with  lights and sirens.     The message from Sgt. Chavez was to live  your life as normal, however remain alert  and use common sense when it comes to  security.  Use caution if a stranger comes to  your door and don’t open the door if you do  not feel comfortable.  Talk through the door  so the stranger knows there is someone  home as they may just be looking for an  unoccupied home.  If you do open the door,  he suggested a security door to keep a  barrier between you and the person.  Again,  if suspicious, call security and the Sheriff.   He also recommends setting your alarm,  even when leaving for a short period of  time, and the use of conspicuous signs, such  as “Beware of Dog” or an  “alarm/surveillance in use”, near your home.   Lighting is also an excellent deterrent,  especially motion activated lights to keep  our light pollution to a minimum.       Phone numbers to keep handy:  Emergency – 911 (when using cell phone  ask to be passed to BCSO)      Non-Emergency – 798-7000  Sandia Heights Security – 856-6347  Security Mobile – 263-4654    Continued on page 2  The GRIT, Dec 2009                                                                                                                    Page 2  Continued from front page:       In spite of my doom and gloom message,  we need to understand that we do live in a  safe neighborhood and break-ins and  vandalism are minimal and not on the rise.  If  we are all Good Neighbors and watch out for  each other, we can continue to maintain our  great lifestyle in a unique community.     Your Board of Directors, our SHHA staff  and all our volunteers wish all of our residents  a very safe and happy holiday season.    SHHA Tree Removal  Lottery Announcement       You have been complaining and your  Community Services & Membership  Committee (CS&MC) has been listening!  Obstruction of views by trees has been one of  the more frequent homeowner concerns  received by the Association over the years.  Now you have a chance to have your tree  removed at no cost to you if it meets certain  criteria as part of SHHA’s Tree Removal  Lottery.     With the approach of winter, deciduous  trees have dropped their leaves and the tempo  of plant growth has slowed. Trees in the  clutches of winter cold, winds, and drought  appear dormant with no apparent growth. But  under the ground, their roots continue to  explore for new sources of water and  nutrients, thus preparing for the burst of  renewed growth which comes with spring.  Once again, our larger tree species will  resume their slow but deliberate assault on  our valley and mountain views!      The CS&MC urges you to take action now.  Are any of your trees interfering with your  enjoyment of Sandia Mountain or the Rio  Grande Valley? Are they interfering with the  views of your neighbors? If the answer is yes,  the time for action is now. Plan to have them  removed before the SHHA Annual Meeting in  June 2010 and enter the Lottery for a chance  to have the cost reimbursed.    Lottery Rules  • Must be a member of the SHHA   • Trees must have been cut and removed after  January 1, 2010  • Any size Siberian Elm* may be entered  (including young sprouts)  • Siberian Elm* stumps must be treated to  prevent re-growth  • Trees of all species over 26 feet high are  eligible  • Trees on County rights-of-way  are eligible  • Only Tree Owner can give permission  for tree removal    To Apply  • Fill out a Lottery application at the SHHA  Office  • Provide a paid copy of the invoice for tree  removal    Winners  • Drawings will follow the SHHA Annual  Meeting in June 2010  • Need not be present to win  •  Winners will receive actual cost of removal  up to a maximum of $750.00 per tree  • Drawings will continue until a total of  $5,000.00 has been awarded       Please see the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org or drop by the SHHA  office for complete Lottery eligibility, entry,  and rules.     * Siberian Elms, often confused with  Chinese Elm, are prohibited by the  Covenants.

The GRIT, Dec 2009                                                                                                            Page 3  Odds & Ends from Parks &  Safety Committee ~ Larry & Frances  Desonier     Those drivers that use San Rafael should be  proud of themselves.  The county did yet  another speed study on San Rafael on October  30th and it turns out that drivers have slowed  down even more.  The speed study before this  showed that drivers had slowed down  considerably after the speed was raised to 20  mph and the humps were lowered.  So  everyone should be really proud of themselves  for helping to make our neighborhood safer.     Also, just another reminder to be aware of  what is going on in the neighborhood around  your house.  Sandia Heights has had several  break-ins in the last two months.  However,  we have been told that those committing those  crimes had been apprehended.  It is always  wise to let your neighbors know when you are  going to be away for an extended time.   Whenever possible park your car in the garage  rather than just in the driveway and remember  not to leave valuables in your car (particularly  gifts visible in the car at this time of the year.)  Pedestrian Safety Reminders  •  Walk Facing Traffic; make eye contact  with drivers approaching you.  •  Wear reflective vest or brightly-colored  clothing, particularly in the evening.   •  If you are walking a dog, keep the dog to  your left.  •  Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single file.                 SECURTY ALERT     There was a rash of break-ins in October  at several locations: White Oaks, Cougar Loop  and Tramway Lane, Unit 10.       The office has a security email alert that can  be emailed to all of those people whose email  addresses are in our database.

The  purpose of this Neighborhood Association  Coalition Meeting for District 4 was to bring  all of our individual neighborhoods together as  we face similar challenges and issues. The  coalition meetings will provide a forum where  neighborhood associations can share ideas and  can even learn of potential collaboration  opportunities.         Twelve local neighborhood associations  from District 4 were invited and seven  associations were in attendance at this first  meeting.  County Commissioner Weiner  called this meeting as he sees all of us are  facing tough economic times with scarce  resources. He too believes that now more than  ever, it is an opportune time for us to work  together to better address our communities  needs. Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association was represented by our Vice  President, Phyllis Moore.       The next District 4 Neighborhood Coalition  meeting will be held in early January 2010 and  the plan will be to hold approximately six  meetings per year.
