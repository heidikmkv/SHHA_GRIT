  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association               June 2009      SHHA Annual/Town Hall Meeting  Church of the Good Shepherd on Tennyson, 10 AM – 12:30 PM, June 6, 2009  Doors open at 9:15 a.m. Drinks and refreshments available.  Come and make your input known. Business to be conducted includes:    Voting on proposed amendments to the bylaws (go to the website for full information)     Introduction of new officers elected by the Board     Presentations by the SHHA committee chairs and officers     Election of new board members    Town Hall Meeting following the annual meeting for members to express their concerns     Door prizes – tickets will be given to members who sign in before 10 am  The SHHA Board needs to know the concerns of the community.   Democracy means involvement!      President’s Message ~ Sy Caudill  The past two years has passed quickly and my  time as president is coming to an end with the  annual meeting this month. Remember we need  your attendance to meet our quorum to conduct  business! Please attend!  Over the past two years, your Board and the  Committees have made some excellent changes  in our association. Most notable are the efforts  to provide additional benefits to members. The  limited pool passes, Tram passes, free concerts  and elimination of Architectural Control  Committee (ACC) fees for members are all  excellent examples of new benefits for our  membership. We have an effective and active  Covenant Support Committee (CSC) that is  constantly dealing with member-reported  violations of our covenants. The ACC has been  processing hundreds of projects to make sure  we maintain the original architectural concepts  as defined by the covenants. We were recently  notified that Bernalillo County has taken action  to obtain the 10 acres at Tramway and  Paseo Del Norte as open space--which SHHA  fully supports.  The new building going on the lot next to our  office is nearing completion, filling out the  business space on that corner. The vacant lot on  the north east corner of San Rafael and  Tramway will eventually be developed; at this  time we do not know the plans. That leaves the  commercial lot next to Futures for Children as  the only significant undeveloped large property  in Sandia Heights.                  Continued on page 3  Don't forget to review the proposed bylaw amendments on the SHHA website.   We have the last of the 3 Q&A sessions to answer your questions and concerns on   June 3, from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Refreshments will be served.

The GRIT, June 2009                                                                                                          Page 3  Continued from Front Page       I think your Board and the ACC have  done a very effective job of ensuring that all  aspects of our community are in harmony  with the 2500+ homes in Sandia Heights.       We have been effective in obtaining  repaving for both Tramway and for major  streets within the community. We can thank  our members who worked these efforts as  well as our elected officials for their support  for capital outlay funds from the state and  county.        We have established a new committee  that is working directly with our state  representatives, Kathy McCoy and  Bill Rehm and county commissioner  Michael Wiener. We will continue to work  with them on the projects I have mentioned  as well as working to gain direct access to  Paseo Del Norte for the fire department--this  will result in decreased response times in  emergencies. I am also glad to report that  our finances are sound and we have  adequate reserves to handle future demands  when they arise.       With all this good news there are still  some areas that have not been adequately  resolved over the past couple of years.  Most  notable is our continuing need for Board  members. We have a dedicated BOD and  they have done a lot for you and YOUR  Association. However, we need new  members and new ideas, as well as taking a  fresh look at established functions.  I am  asking each of you to please consider giving  some of your time to keeping YOUR  Association viable and active. You are the  only ones who can make this work and  continue to improve our community. Please  call the office to volunteer--we need your  assistance.       It has been a pleasure serving this  community and I look forward to new and  better improvements in our Sandia Heights  in the future.              Nominating Committee    ~ Andy Anderson, Chair         Your SHHA Board of Directors would  like to thank Larry Desonier, Michelle  Munson and Dick Wavrik for their  commitment to serve the Sandia Heights  community. In accordance with our bylaws,  the SHHA Board of Directors requires 14  members in order to look after the interests  of the Association. The volunteer services of  these three new directors brings us to a total  of 15 directors, which barely allows us to  function as an organization to oversee the  well being of our community.   Although serving on the Board requires a  commitment on the part of individuals, it is  truly a rewarding experience when the fruits  of our efforts are utilized and recognized by  the 2500 households in our community. The  Board encourages you to take up the  challenge and join us in the experience.

This exciting new member benefit will speed member access to  Tram Passes, Coffeehouse Concerts, and Swim Passes. It will  also come with reduced price offers from participating local  merchants.

The GRIT, June 2009                                                                                                          Page 7          GET EMERGENCY ALERTS  ON YOUR CELL  By: Karen Ziegler, Bernalillo County  Emergency Communications Center     Bernalillo County and its Emergency  Communications Center are pleased to  announce that residents and business owners  in the unincorporated areas of Bernalillo  County may now register their cellular  and/or VoIP phone number(s) to receive  important and/or emergency notifications.   The Emergency Notification System can  send thousands of messages in a very short  time, specifically targeted to certain areas.  Examples of Emergency Notifications  include:  • Evacuation notices caused by emergency  situations such as fires, floods, and  severe weather  • Notifications of dangerous situations  such as an environmental hazard, law  enforcement investigation or other  instance in which you may be instructed  to stay in your home.  *Notifications are NOT automatic and  are sent at the direction of an incident  commander or other managing authority  of a situation.     If you have a landline, your phone number  has automatically been entered into the  system and you will already be set up to  receive emergency notifications. If you  would like to receive emergency  notifications on your cellular/VoIP phone  number, please register your number by  visiting www.bernco.gov and follow the  links below:  • Select and click Depts., Offices and  Divisions  • Select and click Emergency  Communications  • Click on the Emergency Notification  Opt-In link     Keep in mind, however, that when you  register and the Bernalillo County  Emergency Communications Department  sends an emergency message; you will  receive the notification even if you are NOT  in the affected area at the time.     Also, if you change your cellular/VoIP  phone number you will have to re-register.          Community Service &  Membership ~ Swim Pass       Your Association has  made arrangements with  the Four Seasons Club to  purchase a limited  number of passes for  members to the  swimming pool this summer. It is hoped that  this program will encourage annual  membership in the Four Seasons Club and in  SHHA.     Each SHHA member family will be  allowed three (3) visits (free passes) for the  summer. Each pass is good for four (4)  family members or guests each visit. Passes  will be available at the SHHA office and  available on a requested date. A limit of 10  passes could be issued on any one day (40  people.)      Unlike the Tram passes, there is no deposit  required; however, members are reminded  that an unused pass will count as one of the  three allowed per family and might also  deny someone else a pass for that day. Other  specific details and rules are available at the  SHHA office.     This is another great benefit provided by  your Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association.           The GRIT, June 2009                                                                                                         Page 8  ACC Activity Log        The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.    19 Cedar Hill Road – Stairs, fence, & gate.

The Board has been  hampered by some very outdated bylaw  sections in conducting its business. Thus, the  proposed amendments. We scheduled three  Q&A sessions to address your questions and  concerns, and to hopefully shorten the meeting  time as well. Unfortunately, no one came to  the first two sessions. There is one more  session on Wednesday, June 3, from 11:30 -  12:30 at the SHHA office. We would love to  meet  you  and  discuss  the  proposed  amendments. Refreshments will be served.   The GRIT, June 2009                                                                                                         Page 11                                                                    Condition of SH Street Signs   ~ Alyson Clark       Most of the street signs in Sandia Heights  are in good condition but a few are not.  Some of them are either leaning, bent or  otherwise damaged. Several are positioned  in such a way that is misleading and  therefore would be confusing to visitors who  are not familiar with our community.         Imagine yourself trying to follow these  signs at night or during a snow storm. Please  take note of any signs in your neighborhood  that are in poor repair. Call our SHHA office  at 797-7793 to report the name and location  of these. Our goal will be to notify the  county and have them repaired. This  includes the brown fire hydrant posts and  any street signs that are missing, unclear or  ambiguous.                 Missed your letter carrier?      Despite rumors to the contrary, there is a  USPS collection box at the site of the old  Circle K, at Tramway Blvd  and Tramway Lane. It  has only 1 pick-up, at 4  pm, from Mon-Sat. No  holiday pick-up.                  Community Event Bulletin Board  Not all of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
