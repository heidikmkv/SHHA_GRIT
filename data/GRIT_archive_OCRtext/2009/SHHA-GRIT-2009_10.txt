    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                            Oct 2009      President’s message   ~ Andy Anderson    A few weeks ago, an article was  published in the Albuquerque Journal  written by a Journal staff member. The  article related to speed limits and speed  humps in Sandia Heights. The  establishment of speed limits and  installation of traffic calming devices are  the responsibility of the County and,  although these are County issues, the  article cast your SHHA Board of  Directors in a less than complimentary  light. My comments are not to defend the  action of the Board, as they have done  nothing requiring defense, but to simply  set the record straight for our SHHA  membership.      The SHHA Board is made up of your  neighbors and friends who volunteer  their time and service to maintain our  unique quality of life and make Sandia  Heights a better place to live. Along with  the Board, your association relies on  volunteers who also give their time to  ensure the Committees can provide the  services which benefit everyone living in  our community. Neither the Board nor  the volunteers receive any compensation  for their time and efforts, sometimes  taking abuse for doing their jobs. With  this in mind, I personally take exception  when they are ridiculed by individuals  not present at the meeting, and  comments taken completely out of  context, for asking why they should sign  a pledge not required of any other SHHA  member. We struggle to maintain enough  volunteers to keep the organization  running and to ask them to live by more  stringent standards than their neighbors  is degrading and demoralizing. I  personally want to thank them for their  continued dedication and I would invite  other members of the community to join  us in keeping Sandia Heights the  community of choice in the Albuquerque  area.    I would also like to remind everyone  that although we live in a relatively safe  area, we still need to be aware of security  for our homes and neighborhood. We  recently had an instance of a day-time  break-in in the center of Sandia Heights.  In this instance, a van had been noted in  the area for a few days prior to the  incidence and could have been the  vandal looking for an opportunity.  Although we all enjoy our privacy,  please keep an eye out for suspicious  vehicles and don’t hesitate to notify  Sandia Heights Security, mobile: 263- 4654 or the Sherriff’s office: 798-7000  of your concerns.

This results in a narrow  street becoming an extremely narrow single  lane. Recently, it was noted that the problem  was so bad, that larger vehicles couldn’t  even get through. Please remind your guests  to park on only one side of the road.  Those who own dogs like to take  their dog(s) out for a walk. Everyone should  know that county law requires that all dogs  remain on a leash when being walked and  that a dog’s excrement should be picked up.  A dog off a leash can run in front of a car  and get killed, even if the car is going the  speed limit. Don’t take that chance; please,  keep your pet leashed. Also, bring  something to pick up after your dog to keep  our neighborhood clean.   What would happen if you had an  emergency at your house and emergency  services was delayed because they could not  find the number for your address?  This has  already happened in our community. Few of  our streets have curbs to have numbers  painted on; that only leaves the mail box as  a beacon for the ambulance or fire truck. If  you don’t already have your address on your  mailbox, please consider getting reasonably  large and reflective numbers to put there.    Several more of our neighbors have  been seen wearing their safety vests when  out walking our streets. Good for them!  SHHA has already sold 250 vests and have  ordered more. If you have not yet had an  opportunity to purchase one, they are only  $2 for SHHA members and $4 for non- members.           Drivers, remember that school is back in  session and many of our younger  community members are walking to or  waiting at bus stops. Please be extra vigilant  and slow down when passing any pedestrian  along our roadways.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders  • Walk Facing Traffic; make eye  contact with drivers approaching  you.  • Wear reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening.   • If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.  • As cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single  file.                  MARK YOUR CALENDARS for  SATURDAY,  November 7, 2009  SHHA Office  Meet and Greet,  11am to 2pm    Join with your friends and neighbors at the  SHHA office, 2B San Rafael.

Many times valuable minutes  or seconds are lost when the resident calls the office to report  suspicious activity. The security office then has to contact the  officer on patrol and relay the information to him.         In the case of a recent burglary a resident reported the  suspicious vehicle and person (she did a great job with the  description of the vehicle and perpetrator) to the security office.  By the time the security office got off the phone and called the  officer to relay the information to him, the burglar had struck  three houses down. Those valuable minutes could have made  the difference between a possible foiled attempt at a burglary or  in this case sadly a successful break in.        If you have any questions regarding security, please call  Sandia Heights Security at 856-6347.                      The GRIT, Oct 2009                                                                                                          Page 7              SHHA Membership Cards &  Merchant Benefit Program        SHHA members, you should have  received your personal SHHA membership  card and key-ring tag by now.

Sandia Services is pleased to report that to date they  have received over 100 of the mail-in cards from residents to sign  up.  This means that with a little extra effort on our part, we can  reduce the amount of waste in our landfills.          The average American generates about 4 pounds of garbage per day.  Currently about 30% of American’s garbage is recycled. Manufacturing companies  are able to take old paper products and produce “new” newspaper, cardboard and  the like. Aluminum cans are melted down and recycled back into cans. Plastic  bottles, however, are not yet able to be reused as such. Instead, the plastic is melted  down and used to make low grade plastic products used in playgrounds,  electronics, carpet and some fabrics.         The recycling logo is a triangle with chasing  arrows.        The three legs of this triangle stand for collection, manufacturing and  buying. The more we recycle, the more profitable it will be for companies to make  products from recycled material which can be sold to consumers.    We will keep you updated as the starting date, November, 2nd approaches.       Community Event Bulletin Board  Not all of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
