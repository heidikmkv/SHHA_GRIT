    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                            Sep 2009      President’s Message   ~ Andy Anderson      It is hard to believe that summer is  behind us, the kids are back in school  and fall is fast approaching.  With the  days getting shorter, keep in mind the  activity at our school bus stops and be  watchful of folks out enjoying an  evening walk through the neighborhood.   For those of you who enjoy early  morning or late evening walks, you  might want to consider getting one of our  reflective vests which are still available  at the SHHA office.      The summer has been busy for the  SHHA office and the Board and  volunteers have remained active behind  the scenes. The Tram and swim passes  are an attractive benefit for our members  and are being used frequently. We  enjoyed a successful Meet ‘n’ Greet and  have another Coffee House coming up  on September 12th, thanks to the efforts  of the Community Service &  Membership Committee. You should  have also received your SHHA  Membership cards which will expedite  signing in at SHHA activities and  provide discounts at participating local  establishments. Our other committees  continue to do their jobs to keep Sandia  Heights the unique and pristine  community we all enjoy.    Your association has been working for  some time with Sandia Heights Services  to provide the community with a  recycling program. The efforts between  SHHA and Sandia Heights Services have  been fruitful and they have just  announced the initiation of a recycling  pilot program to begin this November.   Please read the associated article in the  GRIT for more details.    Our office has received some calls  regarding the trimming of chamisa and  other vegetation encroaching on our  roads in the community. Our Parks and  Safety Committee serve as our  Association focal point for these  complaints and have established an  agreement with the County to trim them  back and eliminate the safety hazard. If  you need your curb trimmed or note a  hazard in the community, please call our  SHHA office and they will take it from  there.    We continue to need more volunteers to  serve on the Board of Directors and on  our Committees, especially the  Architectural Control Committee. If you  would like to join in to serve your  community please call the SHHA office  or contact any of our Board members to  sign up.

He was  inducted into the Autoharp Hall of Fame in  1993, and he stands only with Maybelle  Carter, Kilby Snow and Sara Carter. For  nearly 3 decades he has been to the autoharp  what Earl Scruggs was to the five-string  banjo. He presents instrumental virtuosity  combined with warmth, eloquence,  expression, and professionalism. He is also  well known as a singer-songwriter, and  increasingly, as a storyteller. See  bryanbowers.com.  "...This man makes more music from an  Autoharp than you can imagine from a 12- string guitar and a harpsichord combined.  He has more stage presence and charisma  than any stage performer in recent  memory."  -The Washington Times    This will be an all-age, alcohol-free event,  free to all SHHA members. General  admission will be $15/adults, $10/teens and  seniors 60+, $5/12 & under, under 5 free.

The pricing is such that the  customer will provide their own clear plastic  bags, or you may also use the plastic grocery  store bags for containing the recycling  materials. Your recyclables will be delivered  to Durango McKinley Paper where they will  be separated and shipped to end users. SHS  will pay a tipping fee and receive no money  for recyclables delivered to Durango  McKinley, they in fact have to pay them to  take them!              SHHA CS&MC is excited about this new  program and encourages all residents of  Sandia Heights to sign up. The success of  the pilot program depends upon residents’  participation! We hope that participation  will be such that this service will be  implemented as part of SHS’s normal solid  waste collection services in the future. The  Committee, primarily through the dedicated  work of its Volunteers, has been hard at  work for nearly a year to bring curbside  recycling to our community. The more who  sign up, the more we will recycle, and the  result will be less solid waste going to the  landfill. For more details watch for your  SHS bill insert notices enclosed with your  monthly SHS bill, the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org, and the SHS  website at sandiaheightsservices.com.              Plague in our neighborhood?    Larry Desonier, Chair Parks & Safety  Committee         Have you noticed any dead animals  around your house lately? There have been  several reports recently of dead animals in  our neighborhood. Remember these dead  animals should never, ever be handled  because of the possibility of plague.  Plague  is a naturally occurring, flea transmitted  disease of rodents and rabbits. Infected  rodents usually die, leaving plague-infected  fleas, which then find new rodent or human  hosts.          Plague infected animals and human cases  have occurred mainly in mountainous  eastern Bernalillo County and in the western  foothills of the Sandias. Humans can  contract plague in three ways: (1) By the  bite of plague infected fleas, (2) by handling  plague infected tissues of sick or dead  animals, or (3) by inhaling infected droplets  from pneumonic patients.          Plague season usually runs from May  through September when rodents, fleas, and  people are most active outdoors. Some of  the animals that are carriers of the plague  include rock squirrels, wood rats, prairie  dogs, mice, gophers, wild rabbits, and  domestic dogs and cats. To prevent plague  around your house make it rodent proof by  elevating woodpiles 6 inches off the ground,  clean-up garbage, clean-up scattered pet  food, clean-up rock piles, and clean-up  brush. Also, keep your pets confined and  dust pets weekly with approved flea powder.              Contact the City/County Vector  Control Office at 873-6613, for flea or  rodent control procedures if you find  dead rodents or the sudden  disappearance of rodents on your  property.              Remember - always walk on the left side  of the street against on-coming traffic.              The GRIT, Sep 2009                                                                                                         Page 8  ACC Activity Log          The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.    15 Sandia Heights Drive – Replace deck railing.

Domingo  Baca is a very wide arroyo with a portion of it  running between Morning Glory Road and  Tramway Lane East of Bobcat Blvd. Some  residents might mistake this area as “Open  Space” when in fact it is entirely private  property.         When dog owners walk their pets along  the roadways they are normally leashed and  orderly. But when they enter the arroyo some  feel that a leash is not required. A few dogs  go ballistic when unleashed and knock over  our bird feeders and trample our landscape.   The owners of these animals have allowed  their pets to get out of their sight and aren’t  aware of the destruction they are causing.      Please respect this private property and  keep your dogs leashed per the Bernalillo  County Ordinance.
