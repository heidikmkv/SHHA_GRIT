    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                            Aug 2009    Vice President’s Message   ~ Phyllis Moore         As your new vice president, I too want to  echo my appreciation for the large turnout at  our SHHA Annual Meeting and the Town  Hall Meeting. We need you next year as  well. The coffee will be hot!       We have assembled a great SHHA  leadership team working together but we  constantly need your support to ensure we  are working toward the goals and issues that  interest and, perhaps, concern you. I know I  heard some great ideas for improvements at  our recent annual meeting. I have passed  them on but not sure all have been  implemented to date.  I encourage you to  stop by at our future planned Meet ‘n’  Greets for further conversation and dialogue  about other potential improvements for our  SHHA community. Our last Meet and Greet  was held Saturday, 25 July. Many of our  SHHA leadership team were in attendance,  and all of our newly relocated Sandia  Heights residents (member and non- member) were invited as well. We try to  schedule a speaker with a relevant topic for  each session. The green chili stew is pretty  good too! See www.sandiahomeowners.org  for more details and the date for our next  Meet ‘n’ Greet.         At this writing we are trying to nail down  our committees and their chairs. We are very  lean as we mentioned at our annual meeting.   So I strongly encourage you to review the  committees below and reflect and ponder  your individual interest and concerns and  take some time and consider joining our  SHHA leadership team as a volunteer. We  need your help and support. We need  diversity of ideas, diversity of units within  the community that each of us represents,  diversity of opinions, and we welcome your  creative solutions to our unknown future  challenges. I want to welcome our new  board members Michele Munson and Dick  Wavrik and the return of Larry Desonier  who were confirmed at our June annual  meeting. In addition, I am pleased to  announce that the at our July Board of  Directors meeting, we confirmed two more  SHHA members and volunteers to our  SHHA Board of Directors. Bob Bowers and  Kate Fry, currently serving on the ACC  Committee, have both agreed to join the  SHHA Board of Directors leadership team  supporting the needs and services of the  Sandia Heights residents. Again a warm  welcome to Bob, Kate, Dick, Michele and  Larry and I know each of you will bring  valuable skills and talents to our Board of  Directors. Note, I have room to add more  names ……..….       Seriously, I request each of you to review  the following committees and see if one may  seem of interest to you and I strongly  encourage you to step forward and learn  more about your SHHA community by  volunteering and in turn meet and work with  your neighbors on projects improving our  beautiful community.         The committees are:    Architectural Control Committee:  Reviews  and approves all plans for new construction,  additions and other exterior modifications  based on covenant provisions.  Monitors  construction for compliance IAW approved  plans.    Covenant Support Committee: Oversees  covenant enforcement process.  Community Service and Membership:  Oversees membership related issues, and  develops new ways to encourage more                                      Continued on page 3  The GRIT, Aug 2009                                                                                                          Page 2  June 2009 Treasurer Report: Ed Tull, Treasurer          CASH FLOW    ACCOUNT BALANCES  INFLOW    Bank Accounts  ACC Interest  75.00   CD #2  38,010.66 CD Interest  0.00   CD #3  15,734.77 GRIT advertising  487.13   CD #5  106,072.75 Membership Dues  13,138.85   Checking  362.06 NM Gross Receipts Tax  28.31   Cash Accounts  1,361.89 TOTAL INFLOW  $13,729.29   Money Market  18,113.53     Total Bank & Cash  $179,655.66 OUTFLOW      Community Relations  13.16   ASSET ACCOUNTS  Community Service &  Membership  216.24   Miscellaneous  1,379.21 Communications &  Publications  2,026.58   Office Equipment  4,973.06 Executive Committee  15.19   Office Furniture  5,651.99 Insurance    Software  932.34 Parks and Safety Vests  -54.00   TOTAL Asset Accounts  $12,936.60 Office Expenses  7,940.76     TOTAL OUTFLOW  $10,157.93   Liability Accounts      Improvements & Legal  Reserve  147,977.00 OVERALL TOTAL  $3,571.36   OVERALL TOTAL  $44,615.26               Announcements & Notices:    ¾ Office Hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.  ¾ SHHA Board meeting – Wed, August 12 at 7pm in the SHHA Office.  ¾ Coffeehouse –Saturday, September 12 at 7:30pm., Church of the Good Shepherd.  ¾ Notary public services are FREE to members.

Now, I know you are saying, I do not  have time, but time is one true equality that  all of us share and that is, we all just have 24  hours a day. However, are we using our time  to support our priorities and are we giving  back to our community?              Furthermore, I still believe one of our  biggest financial assets is our home and we  need to protect and preserve that asset and  we need your involvement to ensure that  will happen.                                       If you would like to volunteer and serve  on a committee, please contact Sheraz or  Betsy at the SHHA office. I look forward to  serving you in the coming year and my goal  is to continue to make Sandia Heights the  community of choice and to protect the  natural setting we have come to love and  enjoy.               NOTICE:   The County held a hearing regarding the  granting of a liquor license to the new  CVS pharmacy on Tramway.

Solicitors in Albuquerque are  forbidden by law to knock on any door  where a sign is posted, clearly stating that  solicitors are not welcome. Such signs  should include the words: “No Trespassing,”  or “No Peddlers,” or “No advertisements” or  “No Soliciting.”       The "no trespassing" is especially  important in addition to the "no solicitation,"  security officers can then ask the solicitor to  leave private property. Remember virtually  all of Sandia Heights is County roadways  and there is no County ordinance that can  keep them off of the roadways. Signs should  be posted where they can be seen from the  roadway.       You can help to keep your neighborhood  safe by doing the following:   .  1) Neighbors should look out for each other  and be aware of strangers on their street.  2) Always look through the ‘peep-hole’  before opening your door, even if you are  expecting company, and NEVER OPEN  THE DOOR late at night unless you  know who it is.  3) Be on the watch for ‘solicitors’ going  door-to-door, perhaps looking for homes  where no one is home.  4) It is important to note that a knock at the  door should not go unanswered in some  manner, whether through the screen door  tor that main door. Criminals posing as a  legitimate solicitor are looking for an  empty house where they can eventually  commit residential burglary.  5) Always be wary about buying services or  items from someone selling door-to-door.  6) If a person’s behavior is deemed to be  abnormal or suspicious, citizens should  call the non-emergency number 798- 7000. In case of emergency, or if  someone witnesses a crime in progress,  dial 911.         News about the downturn in the economy  has been everywhere lately, and with it is  news that property crimes are also on the  rise. In one section of Albuquerque alone, it  has been reported that there has been a 20%  increase in burglary, vehicle thefts and  larceny. By accessing and putting in your  address at www.crimereports.com  you can  get a graphical depiction of reported crimes  in your neighborhood that includes the type  of crime, date and time so you can know  when and what to be on the lookout for.              Community Service &  Membership ~   Swim Passes     Each SHHA member  family is allowed three (3)  visits (free passes) for the summer.
