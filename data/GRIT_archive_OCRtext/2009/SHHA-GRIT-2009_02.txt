    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                           February 2009    As a service to our members we will be  asking each of our elected representatives  to write an article for the GRIT  introducing themselves to our  membership. Commissioner Wiener is the  first of these to write an article and his  comments are below. We want to thank  him for taking the time to express his views  to the community.       As we begin a new year, I too embark on a  new challenge in my life; that of representing  you on the Bernalillo County Commission, as I  took the oath of office on January 1st.      I am deeply appreciative of the more than  47,000 votes I received and am humbled by this  opportunity I have been given to represent you  on this very important body. Thank you for  your support!     There are many challenges we will be facing  during the next four years and I am committed  to make my tenure as county commissioner as  productive as possible by conscientiously  addressing your essential needs and concerns.  Together we can make Bernalillo County an  even better place to live!     In order to do this, I will make every effort to  attend as many of your Sandia Heights  neighborhood association meetings as possible.  I will be continuously available to you to listen  to your concerns, to answer your emails and to  return your phone calls and will be readily  accessible.   Home Telephone: 505-858-0004, Cell  Phone: 505-688-0004, Office Telephone:  505- 468-7230, Email address: mcwabq@aol.com      My background as a NM State Senator,  Albuquerque City Councilor, Real Estate  Broker and small businessman will give me the  experience and confidence to better address the  difficult decisions that I will inevitably  encounter.        As I promised during my campaign, the three  major issues that I will aggressively tackle are:    1.  Working with the state legislature and our  County Assessor Karen Montoya to come up  with a more equitable property tax system that  creates predictability and avoids tax spikes  when buying an existing home or building a  new one.  2.  Working with the Correctional System and  Courts to improve inmate recidivism, including  creating self-sustaining jobs for inmates after  completion of their jail terms. This will involve  introducing work training into our Metropolitan  Detention Center and incorporating  opportunities for inmates to raise their own  food.  3.  I will work with those who are dedicated to  treating animals compassionately to improve  and enforce the Bernalillo County Animal Care  Services Ordinance. I will be encouraging  banks, grocery stores and other businesses to  help in raising money for free spay and  neutering services so that we can better help  control our pet population.     Thank you again for your trust and support.  Sincerely, Michael C. Wiener, Bernalillo  County Commissioner District 4.

Where else can you live within a  mile or so of a major metropolitan area and  still have bobcats, coyotes, deer and bear  literally in your backyard. In my case the  bear and her cub were after the apples a  couple of years ago but our gate still has the  claw marks of their entry.         I think we all recognize the unique  aspects of the community and we all have  our own ideas about how to maintain this  area. Unfortunately, it seems it is getting  harder to reach a consensus about how our  community should be managed and what  position the association should take on a  given issue. Most recently the speed bump  issue raised a lot of concerns both pro and  con. Since we could not find a majority  position on this issue—it was just about  equally split—the Board of Directors took a  neutral position and acted as a facilitator for  connecting the county to our residents by  providing meeting space for county  representatives to address the issue. Some  members are very direct and either call me  or the office or provide an email or a letter  stating their position. Others, for whatever  reason, elect to resort to the anonymous  approach. As an association we will always  reply or try to answer questions from our  members—after all it is your association. It  is our policy not to respond to non-members  or anonymous letters or leaflets. As  members you are welcome to attend  meetings, we do ask that you call ahead to  the office so we can prepare as our space is  limited.       I bring up these two apparently separate  issues as the decision on how to maintain the  community rests with the members and your  participation in the process. We have a very  active committee meeting with our elected  representatives to advocate for road and  infrastructure funding. We also have very  active Architectural Control and Covenant  Support Committees, as well as our Parks  and Safety Committee—among others.  These committees are the key to establishing  the positions of the association and bringing  issues to the Board of Directors. We need  your support on these committees and the  Board to keep the association running. I  know that I’ve written on this in previous  issues but we are headed toward our annual  meeting and we need to fill several vacant  seats on the board.  We can also use  volunteers on any and all of our committees  and for these positions we do not require  board membership. So you can serve in any  of two ways as well as volunteering to assist  or join our Membership Committee which  has brought you such benefits as the Tram  Passes and free concerts.       By serving along with your neighbors  you can keep these many activities viable.  You can also assist in the development of  positions the board takes on many different  issues and help guide the association in  development of the future of our great  community. I am asking each of you to  consider just how important the community  is to you and your family. How do decisions  about the community impact your home  values? What activities should the  association support? What should the  association’s position be on important issues  like speed limits? The only way we can  reach a consensus on any issue in the  community is to have active board and  committee members—we need your help in  filling these seats. Please consider giving a  few hours of your time to your community.   Thank you.

However, viewers receiving their TV  broadcasts via cable or satellite will not be  affected and will not have to change their set  connections in any way. Viewers receiving  direct transmissions, however, would have  to purchase a converter box such as those,  for example, sold by Wal-Mart, Radio  Shack, etc.      DTV Converter Box Coupons  The government’s DTV coupon program  can save you $40.

To do this we need the support and help of  the community in running the association.  We are now beginning the process for  finding new volunteer directors for 2009.  Board members are elected for 3-year  terms with elections at the Annual  Meeting in June. The 3-year commitment  is revocable if your personal  circumstances change; you may submit a  resignation letter, although we would like  to have members serve at least one year.     What are the qualifications for the job-Just  a love of this wonderful neighborhood and  a desire to work with others to keep it  vibrant. We need representation on the  board from all of the units and we urge  you to consider taking this opportunity to  become a board member.     The next few years will be an exciting  opportunity for you to help plan the future  of our neighborhood-your neighborhood.  Please review pages RG-8 & 9 of the 2009  Residents Guide, which lists the duties of  the committees and other functions of the  board. If you are willing to serve as a  board member, we urge you to contact  Andy Anderson at 856-7116 or contact the  office at 797-7793 or email:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.      We hope you share our goal in preserving  the Sandia Heights we all enjoy and love.  Serving as a member of the board is a  rewarding opportunity and we hope you  will join us in this effort. The board could  also use more parents with young children  and women members, to help bring more  diversity in identifying the needs of our  community. We will accept volunteers  from all units, but we would encourage  homeowners in the following units to  volunteer, since they are not currently  represented on the board: North: 2 and 3,  South: 1 and 2, 5, 6, 7, 8C, 9, 10, 15, 16,  18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27A, 27B or 27C,  28A & 28 B.

We have even noticed fellow  neighbors wearing them when they are out  walking our streets. Thank you!               Our committee is convinced that, by  wearing these vests, you make yourself  much more visible to oncoming traffic,  which we believe will certainly result in  greater safety for you. If you have not yet  bought one, please consider buying them.  We are selling them below cost to SHHA  members at $2 and for just $4 to non- members.           We also want to once again remind each  of you that you are much safer when  walking FACING traffic and, fortunately, it  does seem that many more of you are  beginning to do just that. Good for you!  Making eye contact with drivers  approaching you assures you that the driver  is aware that you are on the road.         Drivers are encouraged to be vigilant  when driving our streets and not to speed  through such a beautiful environment.  Drivers and pedestrians alike should be  particularly careful when out at dusk. Be  aware that drivers traveling around dusk are  blinded by the sun and cannot see  pedestrians. Therefore, please be even more  vigilant when walking or driving during this  dangerous time of the day.          We also want to remind all homeowners  to maintain your curbside property so that  pedestrians may step off of the road  whenever they need to avoid a dangerous  situation. As you probably know by now,  each homeowner is responsible for  maintaining the curbside adjacent to their  property.  Nevertheless, the county has  agreed to trim vegetation along our roads at  a 45-degree angle to improve visibility.  They are attempting to keep vegetation  along our roadsides trimmed every six  months or so. Please contact myself or the  SHHA office to report any areas you feel are  overgrown to the point that they restrict  visibility or could cause damage to a  vehicle.         May each of you have a New Year full of  wonderful experiences!                   ACC Activity Log     The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.      793 & 795 Tramway Lane – Landscape  entrance way to Tramway Lane for both  groups of units.

If the situation arises and  you need maintenance on your road/street, including snow removal,  please call the county at 848-1503. The county is responsible for  removing snow from the public roads. If you should need assistance  with snow removal from your private driveway, here are several  people you can call:  Dave Carillo 220-9797 or Duke City 250-6477                                 While the County has a restrictive ordinance on open burning for certain  materials, covenants in Sandia Heights prohibit burning. They generally  state: “No trash shall be burned on the premises except in approved  incinerators located indoors or within service yard. No garbage shall be  burned. Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said containers to be  concealed from public view by an attractive enclosure. No barbecue or other  outdoor cooking facility shall be located thereon nearer than ten feet from  either side of lot line unless made a part of the residence.” To check your  covenants you may look them up online at www.sandiahomeowners.org in the Covenants folder.
