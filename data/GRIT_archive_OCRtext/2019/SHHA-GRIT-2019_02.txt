    Security Tips  By the Parks & Safety Committee    Within the Sandia Heights, residents may see patrol cars from Bernalillo  County Sheriff Office and Sandia Heights Security. In case of need, which  one should you call?      Phone Numbers of Interest:    Police, Fire, Rescue (emergency need)   call 911    Sheriff (non-emergency need)    798-7000    Fire (non-emergency need)     798-7000    Sandia Heights Security (mobile)    263-4654    Sandia Heights is in the jurisdiction of Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Depart- ment. Thus, in case of criminal activity (e.g., -breaking & entering, theft,  etc.) or harm to a person, call 911 and let them know you reside in Bernalillo  County.  It is good practice to form trusted relationships with your neighbors to  minimize risk. Agree to watch out for each other and report any suspicious  activity in and around your home. Sandia Heights Security can be of service  in cases of suspicious activity. Statistically, residential burglaries occur  more during the day, so, if possible, identify trusted neighbors who might  be home during then. It could be called ‘Neighborhood Watch’!*  Sandia Heights Security Department: The Sandia Heights Security Patrol  operates a prominently marked vehicle throughout the community. The  primary function of the patrol is to provide a high-visibility deterrent to  crime in the subdivision. For members, the patrol also responds to residen- tial alarm calls, suspicious persons and vehicles, lost persons or pets, and  assists the Bernalillo County Sheriff and Fire Departments, as needed or re- quested. Other functions of the patrol are to provide special watches for  residents who are away from their homes, as well as responding to loud  parties, alarms, etc. Note that they are not involved in the “investigation”  of crime. They are a subscription-based service and not connected with the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association.    *  The process for forming a Neighborhood Watch is described in the April 2018 GRIT. It  will also be available at the SHHA Annual Meeting on February 9.    Did you know…  that you can read the minutes of the SHHA Board of Directors’ meetings on  the SHHA website?

Renters and Membership Benefits    Did you know that people renting or leasing houses in  Sandia Heights can participate in many of the benefits  of SHHA membership? All that is needed is for the  property owner to maintain membership in SHHA.  Many property owners mistakenly believe that if they  move from Sandia Heights and rent their house to an- other family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true! Membership dues can continue to be  collected as part of the monthly utility bill for that ad- dress, whether the property owner pays the bill, or the  tenant pays the bill. If you as a property owner pay the  bill, you are free to pass along the cost of membership  to the tenant should you choose. Renters are eligible  for all SHHA membership benefits except voting privi- leges and filing covenant violation complaints. Tram  passes are among the most popular member benefits,  so be sure you maintain your membership and let your  tenants experience some of the great “perks” of living  in Sandia Heights!  email Addresses in the   Directory…Maybe  By Susan McCasland, Communications & Publications  Committee Chair    Communication via email is to a large extent supplant- ing communication via telephone or physical mail. To  provide more useful information for communication  between Sandia Heights residents, the Board is consid- ering including email addresses starting in the 2020  Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory with, as is  the case with telephone numbers, allowing residents to  opt in or out of having their email information included.  Results from a recent survey on social media (see the  following page) suggest that email is by far the most  used and trusted electronic communications method  for Sandia Heights residents.  We want to hear from you! Would you like to see  email included in the Directory? Would you “opt in” to  having your email listed in the Directory? Send us an  email (addresses on the front page) and let us know  your thoughts. Also, let us know your email address if  you’d like to opt in (if we do include emails next year) or  if you’d like to receive the SHHA email alerts and aren’t  already.  Don’t Forget  2019 SHHA Annual Meeting  February 9, 2019, 9 AM – 12 PM    Church of the Good Shepard  7834 Tennyson Street NE  Doors open at 8:30 AM  Refreshments and pastries catered by O’Beans Coffee    Business to be conducted includes:    Introduction of the 2018 Board of Directors and  SHHA Standing Committee volunteers    Introduction of 2019 Officers elected by the Board  of Directors    2018 Reports from the Officers and committee chairs    Q&A from the SHHA members in attendance  SHHA Membership Engagement includes:    Facilitated breakout sessions on topics of interest  • Themes: 1. Safety and Security, 2. Association  Function, 3. Covenant Enforcement, 4. Address- ing Community Needs for Families with Children    The SHHA Board wants to hear from the community— YOU!    3   The GRIT – February 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 2  Did You Know That Bernalillo County  Has a Noise Ordinance?  By the Covenant Support Committee    For complaints regarding noise (e.g., from homes,  cars, motorcycles, restaurants or other business- es, etc.) you can call the Environmental Health Office  at 314-0310 and County Commissioner Lonnie Talbert  at 468-7010. For car/motorcycle racing up and down  Tramway Boulevard and throughout our Sandia  Heights streets and neighborhoods, call the non- emergency number for the Sheriff at 768-4160.   Often, when it is a neighbor who is causing the  noise, it helps to make a polite request to that person  to resolve the prob- lem. If you subscribe to  Sandia Heights Security  you can call the mobile  patrol to check on loud  parties, but all other  complaints need to go  to the Sheriff's Office or  as noted above.     Social Media Survey Results  By Susan McCasland, C&PC Chair    During the month of December, there was a survey  open to collect your opinions on having an SHHA so- cial media presence. 161 of you responded (thank  you!). And your Board has listened. There will be no  SHHA social media at this time. But we will be beef- ing up email and website communications.  80% of you use one or more forms of social media  more than once a month. More than 80% of those  who do engage with social media use both Facebook  and Nextdoor. (Note: there is a Nextdoor bias as the  availability of the survey was announced in the GRIT,  on the SHHA website, and to the Sandia Heights  South subscribers to Nextdoor.) And 20% or more  also  use  YouTube,  LinkedIn,  Instagram  and Pinterest.  When asked if you  would interact with  SHHA on social media,  it was pretty evenly  split between “yes,”  “no,” and “maybe.”  However, there was substantial pushback on why  social media should be used at all, given privacy and  hacking concerns. Many failed to see value in SHHA  having a social media presence. And many folks ex- pressed the opinion that the current email alerts plus  the GRIT and the SHHA website provide the infor- mation they need, particularly if there were more  alerts, if needed, and if the website content was kept  more current. Some respondents wanted more in- formation on crime in the neighborhood, including  near-real-time alerts when a crime has happened. But  the SHHA does not receive such information to dis- seminate. There are the statistics published monthly  in the GRIT on calls coming in to Sandia Heights Secu- rity. More serious crime would be reported to Bern- Co Sheriff, but not to SHHA. For neighbor-to- neighbor notifications, the existing Nextdoor app is  the best current solution.  We do hear you. Responding to the survey, we are  looking into including email addresses in the annual  Residents Directory (see previous page). We will also  send out email alerts for a wider variety of issues. Of- ten now the only alert in a given month is of the GRIT  being available on the website. That will change. And  we will be going through the website, updating or  removing old notices and making room for new ones.    33 Years Ago (from the January 1986 GRIT)  Homeowner Survey Results    The homeowners survey had excellent response. We  had 3 times the anticipated rate of return based on  average survey return rates. So, congratulations to  Sandia Heights residents and thank you! The Board of  Directors feels it now has a good basis for making  decisions on your behalf in 1986.  For the more than 100 residents who volunteered  to assist in neighborhood projects and events, thank  you. We welcome you and your ideas. …  Big Winner—The most interest was shown in the  jogging and biking path along Tramway Blvd. An  overwhelming majoring [sic] of respondents asked  the Board of Directors to pursue this activity first. We  look forward to working with the 36 residents who  volunteered to assist.  …  Natural gas to the neighborhood was the second  most favored activity to pursue in 1986. Thanks to  the 30 residents who volunteered to assist. …    4   The GRIT – February 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 2    DECEMBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

There was a great deal of interest both within our community and from the wider metro  area. The project was featured in the Albuquerque Journal (front page, above the fold!), and local TV news on  KOB, KRQE and KOAT. The goats reduced the flammable plant life significantly, yet in an eco-friendly, non- destructive way. Go by and see for yourself. Here are some photos of the grazers hard at work eating, includ- ing cholla!      8   The GRIT – February 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 2     ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:  5 Juniper Hill Road – Window Replacement  8 Juniper Hill Loop – Roof Repair  323 Paintbrush Drive – Re-roof  518 Black Bear Loop – Re-roof  879 Tramway Lane Court – Patio Cover  1822 Tramway Terrace Loop – HVAC Replacement  2323 Calle de Gabriel – Install Security Doors  2324 Calle de Gabriel – Install Gutters and Downspouts  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to  read about all projects currently under ACC manage- ment.     The Architectural Control   Committee’s (ACC)  Neighborhood Review Process  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    I feel that it’s necessary to periodically revisit the  subject of the ACC’s Neighborhood Review (NR)  process since use of the NR is an integral part of  how the ACC evaluates projects, particularly large  ones, within the community.  Our covenants place the authority to evaluate  project applications with the ACC. The ACC uses the  NR as a courtesy to the community as part of its  evaluation process. The NRs are used primarily for  informing neighbors of a proposed project in their  immediate vicinity. After an application is submit- ted and the ACC determines that a proposed pro- ject is in compliance with applicable covenants, it  then considers the approval of the project. Prior to  the approval, the committee may decide to con- duct a NR. This decision is made when the ACC feels  that the project may impact views or not be in over- all harmony with the neighborhood.  Once the ACC decides that a NR is appropriate  for a project, the following steps occur:  1. A notification letter is sent to neighbors in the  vicinity. The letter describes the project and advises  addressees that they have seven working days to  visit the SHHA office to review the project plans  and respond in writing with comments. These plans   normally consist of a plot plan (usually a valid prop- erty survey) showing the footprint of the project on  the property, a basic floor plan, and exterior eleva- tion drawings with the proposed heights of the com- pleted structure as viewed from different directions.  2. Once all comments are received, the ACC pro- vides feedback to the project applicant and works  with the applicant to address the comments in ways  that both parties feel could enhance the project from  a neighborhood point of view.  3. If the ACC feels that comments expressed dur- ing the NR process indicate that there is a general  feeling of uneasiness within the applicable neighbor- hood, the ACC schedules a meeting to allow neigh- bors to meet with the ACC.  4. Once the ACC has received all comments from  the NR and from any subsequent meetings, the ACC  considers all of the comments before making a final  decision on the project. Along with general condi- tions stated in all ACC approval letters, specific con- ditions stemming from relevant neighborhood com- ments are incorporated, as appropriate, in the final  approval letter.  The NR process is the product of many years of ex- perience dealing with the community’s need to build,  update, or modify its residences. The ACC was estab- lished to provide overall guidance to property own- ers and to maintain reasonable control of the archi- tectural standards imposed by the covenants. In the  beginning, there was no such “animal” as the NR and  it became quickly obvious that this sort of review was  important in order to consider the impact of a con- struction project from a neighborhood’s point of  view. The ACC continues to strongly endorse the  value of the NR as a key ingredient of its evaluation  process and I encourage all recipients of a NR notifi- cation letter to review the relevant drawings and  plans and to submit comments, as appropriate. Don’t  miss this opportunity and then, once the project has  been approved and is underway, regret that you  failed to take the time to voice your concerns.      9 The GRIT - February 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 2 10 The GRIT - February 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 2 11   The GRIT – February 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 2     Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
