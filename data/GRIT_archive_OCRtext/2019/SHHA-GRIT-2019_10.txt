    YOUR DUES ARE HOW MUCH?  By Cheryl Iverson, SHHA Treasurer    That’s the question we hear from other homeowners’ associations  in Albuquerque when they find out the amount of dues paid by  SHHA members. We pay a great deal less than other neighbor- hoods, but we enjoy an amazing variety of benefits for such a small  sum.  However, expenses such as oﬃce rent, utilities, labor costs  and insurance costs have risen steadily over the past several years.  Benefits of SHHA membership can be found on the SHHA website  at:  http://sandiahomeowners.org/notices-and-information/shha- member-benefits.     Due to the increases we are seeing from our vendors, we find it necessary  to increase our monthly dues.  Eﬀective January 1, 2020, SHHA membership  dues will increase from $8.00 to $8.50 per month.  The last time dues were  raised was in 2012, and we know you will understand and support the need  to raise the dues at this time.    TRAM PASS PRICE INCREASE  By Cheryl Iverson, SHHA Treasurer    One of our favorite benefits that SHHA provides is the reduced price SHHA  homeowner members pay for tram tickets.  Due to an increase in the cor- porate package we purchase from Sandia Peak Tram Company, we will  need to increase the price SHHA members pay from $6.00 to $7.00  eﬀective January 1, 2020. As always, we will have 8 tickets per day available  on a first come basis. The full Sandia Peak Tramway Pass Procedure for  SHHA Members is available in the SHHA office or online at http://san- diahomeowners.org/notices-and-information/notices-and-information/96- tram-passes.

By Kate Fry, SHHA Member    Bears are still visiting our  neighborhoods looking for  food, and now, as we head  into autumn, they are becom- ing eating machines. Bears are  biologically programmed to  eat as much as they can in  preparation for their long win- ter’s nap.  We have a pretty  good acorn crop this year.  Be- cause bears need to gain so  much weight before they den,  they might venture down into  our neighborhood looking for  their natural food sources, in- cluding acorns, piñon nuts,  and prickly pear fruit.  But if  they find food humans leave  out, like garbage or bird seed,  that spells trouble for the  bears.  Bird seed especially is very calorie-dense, and if bears find it they will keep coming back looking for more.   Bears are very intelligent.  They remember any place they have ever found food and return unerringly to it.  They  know what trash cans and bird feeders are and will always investigate them for food.    Please stay alert and don’t do anything to attract bears to your home.  Keep trash indoors until the morning of  pickup, bring bird feeders and hummingbird feeders indoors at night, and keep kitchen doors and windows  closed after dark.  Please understand that a trapped bear does not transplant well. A high percentage of bears die  after being relocated.  Simply seeing a bear is not a reason to call Game and Fish.  Bears tend to be shy and afraid  of humans, and they won’t bother you if you don’t bother them.  If there is no “junk food” to be found, the bear  will probably munch a few acorns and go back into the mountains.      We’re asking all Sandia Heights residents to be tolerant, understanding, and proactive.  Enjoy the sight of a bear  if you happen to see one, but please don’t do anything to unintentionally feed them.    Thank You, SHHA Members  By Emily Rudin, Vice President and Nominating Committee Chair    As a direct result of a series of articles in The GRIT calling for candidates for SHHA’s Board of Directors, I’m pleased and  excited that so many of you have contacted us. To a person, you have told us you’ve taken those articles seriously as an  inspiration to volunteer. We’re actively interviewing candidates now. And thanks, too, to all of you who have expressed  interest in joining one of our committees. My colleagues on the Nominating Committee and I are grateful to see that we  have a strong community of members stepping up to help the Association continue serving you. Thank you for heeding  the call with concern and dedication. SHHA truly needs you. If you’re interested in serving, but have not contacted us,  it’s not too late. You are welcome to contact the Office and we’ll respond right away. Thank you, SHHA!    3   The GRIT – October 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 10          2019 Albuquerque International   Balloon Fiesta Schedule of Events  October 5 – 13, 2019    FRIDAY, OCTOBER 4  7:00 am Albuquerque Aloft (at local elementary schools)    SATURDAY, OCTOBER 5  6:00 am Dawn Patrol Show, presented by Route 66 Ca- sino Hotel and RV Resort  6:30 am Krispy Kreme Morning Glow  6:45 am Opening Ceremonies  7:00 am Mass Ascension, presented by Canon  2:00 pm America’s Challenge Gas balloon Inflation  6:00 pm America’s Challenge Gas Race Launch  6:00 pm Twilight Twinkle Glow™, presented by Albuquer- que Journal  8:00 pm AfterGlow™ Fireworks Show, presented by San- dia Resort and Casino    SUNDAY, OCTOBER 6  6:00 am Dawn Patrol Show, presented by Route 66 Ca- sino Hotel and RV Resort  6:30 am Krispy Kreme Morning Glow  7:00 am Mass Ascension  9:00 am Fiesta of Wheels Car Show (located on north  end of Launch Field)  11:00 am Balloon Fiesta Pin Trading (Group Tour Tent  north end of Main Street)  6:00 pm Balloon Glow  8:00 pm AfterGlow™ Fireworks Show, presented by San- dia Resort and Casino    MONDAY, OCTOBER 7  6:00 am Dawn Patrol  7:00 am Balloon Launch from Park  8:00 am Fly In Competition    TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8 COCA-COLA DAY  6:00 am Dawn Patrol  7:00 am Balloon Launch from Park  8:00 am Fly In Competition    WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9  6:00 am Dawn Patrol presented by Route 66 Casino Ho- tel and RV Resort  6:30 am Krispy Kreme Morning Glow  7:00 am Flight of the Nations Mass Ascension  8:00 am Fly In Competition            THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10 KIDS’ DAY presented by KOB–TV  4:30 am Kids’ Day Goodie Bag Distribution begins (South  of Main Street Stage)  6:00 am Dawn Patrol  7:00 am Special Shape Rodeo™  8:00 am Fly In Competition  6:00 pm Special Shape Glowdeo™  8:00 pm* AfterGlow™ Fireworks Show, presented by  Sandia Resort and Casino    FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11  6:00 am Dawn Patrol  7:00 am Special Shape Rodeo™  8:00 am Fly In Competition  6:00 pm Special Shape Glowdeo™  8:00 pm* AfterGlow™ Fireworks Show, presented by  Sandia Resort and Casino    SATURDAY, OCTOBER 12  6:00 am Dawn Patrol Show, presented by Route 66 Ca- sino Hotel and RV Resort  6:30 am Krispy Kreme Morning Glow  7:00 am Mass Ascension  11:00 am Balloon Fiesta Pin Trading (Group Tour Tent  north end of Main Street)  1:00 - 5:00 pm Music Fiesta  6:00 pm Night Magic™ Glow, presented by Canon  8:00 pm* AfterGlow™ Fireworks Show, presented by  Sandia Resort and Casino    SUNDAY, OCTOBER 13  6:00 am Dawn Patrol Show, presented by Route 66 Ca- sino Hotel and RV Resort  6:30 am Krispy Kreme Morning Glow  7:00 am Farewell Mass Ascension    * AfterGlow™ fireworks shows will begin as soon as the launch  field is clear of balloons; thus, the starting times are approximate  and subject to change without notice.

Covenant Support Committee (CSC) Needs  Volunteers   The CSC needs new members to help with the enforcement  of the covenants for the Sandia Heights community. The re- sults from the last SHHA Annual Meeting and recent surveys  have consistently shown that covenant enforcement is a  high priority for homeowners. If you are a homeowner and  dues paying member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA) please consider volunteering for your  Covenant Support Committee and help ensure the enforce- ment of SHHA covenants. We meet at the SHHA office once  a month, and we have the excellent back up of our SHHA  staff. Covenant enforcement contributes significantly to  preserving our beautiful and unique community. Please  share your appreciation of the Sandia Heights community  and join the CSC. You can volunteer by calling the SHHA of- fice at 505-797-7793 or by sending an email to san- diaheights@comcast.net.     Responding to Home Emergency Situa- tions  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC    NOTE:  This article is published frequently and is mainly for  the benefit of our newcomers since they may not under- stand what needs to be done regarding ACC involvement  when a home emergency occurs.  Hope the information is  useful!    As a homeowner, as many of you know, emergency sit- uations involving your home can occur from time to  time.  If you happen to encounter a situation such as a  broken or clogged water or sewer line, repair or re- placement of your septic system, a leaky roof, stucco  damage (particularly at the parapet locations), a large  tree or tree branch that may pose a danger to your  property if not trimmed or removed, or any other situ- ation where the urgency of the issue requires quick ac- tion on your part in order to prevent or minimize prop- erty damage, the ACC does not want to stand in your  way.  You do not need to submit an ACC application  form for these types of situations.  Just let the SHHA  office know that you will be tending to an emergency  situation and, if applicable, heavy equipment may be  needed to fix the problem. The phone number at the  SHHA office is 797-7793.  This information will help the  office answer questions from your neighbors who may  be inquiring about what is going on at your residence.    Just as a reminder, be careful when selecting a  contractor to handle an emergency repair or for any  other repairs or modifications to your residence.  There  are many individuals looking for business and some of  these folks may not be properly licensed or insured.   You bear the risk of poor quality workmanship and a  host of other problems if you choose to use an unli- censed or uninsured contractor.  I have included arti- cles in the GRIT on this subject over the past several  years so take some time and familiarize yourself with  just how to make sure that your contractor is properly  licensed and insured before you “sign on the dotted  line”.  Don’t be a victim of an unlicensed or uninsured  contractor!    Once your emergency issue has been solved  and you wish to pursue a permanent fix to minimize or  prevent the recurrence of that particular issue, you  would then be required to submit an application to the  ACC.  Examples of this would include replacing your en- tire roof, re-stuccoing your residence, or replacing a  large tree that was removed.  Keep in mind that trees  which will exceed the height of your roofline when  they reach full maturity are not authorized since they  can interfere with the views of neighboring properties.   Also, The ACC does not need an application for replace- ment or repair of your septic system.  Wastewater sys- tems are handled by the County’s Public Works Depart- ment and they will issue the proper permits and per- form the proper inspections to ensure that the septic  system meets County requirements.    From all of the members of the ACC, please re- member that the Committee is here to help you in any  way we can through all phases of your home improve- ment projects.

Community Survey 2019 is Again Very  Positive!!  By Stephen S. Baca, Community Service & Membership  Committee Chair    Responses to the 2019 Resident’s Survey were again  very positive. There will be more detailed results  published in the GRIT in the future and the entire survey  will be available on the SHHA website.  But, here are a  few of the exciting learnings from the Survey.  To begin with, 485 were the number of responses.   Many more than would be expected from a survey.   Consequently, we have been able to calculate a  confidence level of over 95% and a margin of error of  less than 5%. So, this is great.  And, the results are even  better.  Two are especially important: 87% of you are  proud or extremely proud to live in Sandia Heights; over  93% of you feel safe or extremely safe walking alone in  Sandia Heights (up from 89% last year).  New this year,  we learned that over 71% of you would like to get to  know more of your neighbors.  Over 68% of you  strongly recommend Sandia Heights as a place to live  (up from 58% last year.)  That is, by industry standards,  comparable to Apple, Amazon, and Southwest Airlines.  We again were able to validate the 4 key themes  (Safety/Security, Covenant Enforcement, Effectiveness  of SHHA and Community/Children Activities) from the  Annual Meeting.  This is just the kind of quantitative  guidance and individual suggestions that are needed to  focus the actions of your SHHA Board of Directors.  Thank you for your continued interest in making  Sandia Heights the best place to live in Albuquerque!        Halloween Safety Tips   Remember to put the electronic devices down for a  night.   A responsible adult should accompany young  children.   If older teens and tweens are going alone, plan an  acceptable and safe route.   Travel only in familiar, well-lit areas and stick with  friends/family.   Cross the street at corners, traffic signals or  crosswalks.   Make eye contact with drivers before crossing in  front of their vehicles.

Each small dinner group is typically 6-8 people, including the hosts.  We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the  menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal – along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller,  there are 2 whole group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The  dinner group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights  residents are welcome.
