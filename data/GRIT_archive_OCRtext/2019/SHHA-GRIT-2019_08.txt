By Susan Seligman, Covenant Support Committee    It seems that many residents are leaving their bins ei- ther on the roadside or next to their homes where they  are visible to neighbors and passersby. We would like to  remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is  a violation of all our Sandia Heights Covenants which  state, in general, “Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed from public  view….” Please, when your trash and recyclables have  been collected, return your bins to storage out of public  view. Simply parking trash bins beside the garage is not  acceptable. They must be hidden from street view.  We would like to remind all residents that trash (in- cluding recycling) must be out no later than 7AM on the  scheduled pickup day, and no earlier than 5PM on the  evening prior to collection. In addition, if you have edi- ble garbage in the bin, please don’t put the bin out over- night. We don’t want our bear friends to find it. First  thing in the morning is better when bears are not hiber- nating. Thanks for helping keep Sandia Heights a beau- tiful place for all of us to live.      Does your house look like this? If so, you are in violation of San- dia Heights covenants. Please store your garbage cans in your  garage or behind an attractive enclosure. Together, let’s keep  Sandia Heights beautiful !        2015 cover by Mark Miller  2013 cover by Marie Wise  3   The GRIT – August 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 8  Septic System Tips  By Bob Bower, Architectural Control   Committee Chair    The following are a few basic tips to help keep your  septic system functioning efficiently.  1. Conserve water to reduce the load on the septic  system. Use of flow-reducer shower nozzles and low- flow toilets will help.  2. Tree roots can cause major damage to your sep- tic tank. Make sure new and existing trees are located  a reasonable distance away from the septic system  (100 feet is recommended). Don’t plant trees such as  willows that have aggressive root systems anywhere  near your septic system.  3. Design landscaping, roof gutters, and foundation  drains to divert water away from the septic system’s  drain field.  4. Don’t flush cat litter, disposable diapers, baby  wipes, antiseptic wipes, sanitary napkins, tampons,  paper towels, facial tissues, coffee grounds, cigarette  butts, condoms, or similar items down your drains.  These items can quickly clog your septic system. Use  single-ply toilet paper that is advertised as septic  friendly. If you use a house cleaning service, make sure  that the service personnel understand what items not  to flush down your toilets or put down your drains. If  you have house guests, make sure they understand  your septic system rules.  5. Use garbage disposals sparingly. They can double  the amount of solids added to a septic tank.  6. Don’t overuse heavy cleaners, especially those  containing bleach. These items can kill beneficial bac- teria in the septic tank.  7. Never pour grease or hazardous chemicals down  your drains.  8. Do not drive over a drain field, build a structure  on top of it, or cover it with concrete or asphalt.  9. Do not plant grass, deep-rooted shrubs, or trees  on the drain field.  10. Some professionals recommend a monthly dose  of an enzyme product that adds beneficial bacteria to  your septic system. Others say it isn’t necessary—but  septic additives are not expensive so they can’t hurt.  The choice is yours.  11. A word of caution! Never attempt to open a sep- tic tank yourself. The gases in it are dangerous. Call a  professional pumping company to empty and inspect  the tank as required.  Have you used a contractor lately?     The SHHA Office has two large binders with contrac- tor evaluations that Sandia Heights residents have  filled out. They cover a variety of different services.  We need new and updated evaluations from appli- ance repair companies to pet-sitters to window wash- ers and multiple things in between. These binders are  available in the office for SHHA members to peruse.  You may obtain a Contractor Evaluation Form from  the SHHA Office or online at: http://sandiahomeown- ers.org/committees/architectural-control-commit- tee/acc-forms        Sandia Peak Restaurant Has a Name    It will be called Ten3.

It’s Back-to-School Time!  By Susan McCasland, C&PC Chair    Most students return to school on August 12 this year.  With the return of children going to and from school,  there are several things we need to pay attention to.  First, if you have an Albuquerque Public School stu- dent and need to know where and when for them  catch the bus, here’s the website that will tell you that:  https://mybusstop.aps.edu/  With children out and about going to/from school,  drivers should be extra vigilant. Never pass a stopped  school bus with blinking lights. Don’t assume that chil- dren know all the rules of the road—give them a  chance to grow up and learn them. As the days  shorten, be on the lookout for small, unilluminated  people crossing roads in the dark. A first, excellent step  toward child road safety is to obey the speed limits, es- pecially in residential areas!        Annual Survey Open Until August 15  By Stephen Baca, Community Services   and Membership Chair    The SHHA Annual Survey is currently available for you  to express your opinions. The survey will remain open  until August 15. Results from last year’s survey have in- formed the Board of Directors and its committees of  initiatives that residents want. For example, the Easter  Egg Hunt was directly related to your neighbors’ sug- gestions of increasing activities for children. And part- nering with local businesses keeps costs to our mem- bers very low.   You can find the survey at https://www.survey- monkey.com/r/shha-2019. Your responses can be en- tered in less than 10 minutes. And, if you are reading  this article in print form, here is the QR Code to get you  to the survey.    Remember: just a few more days to make your opin- ions known! And thank you if you have already taken  the survey.    Some Pointers About Hantavirus  By Susan McCasland, C&PC Chair    Hantavirus can cause Respiratory Distress Syndrome  and, if untreated, is potentially fatal. Field rodents, par- ticularly deer mice, are carriers of the virus. Rodent  urine, saliva and feces spread the infection if breathed  in, through cuts in the skin, by rubbing the eyes, by ro- dent bites, or by eating contaminated food. There is no  evidence of person-to-person spread.  Avoid direct contact with rodents and their drop- pings, nests, habitats, or items which may be contami- nated by rodents. Deer mice can enter your home  through holes as small as a shirt button. Seal holes with  steel wool, wire mesh, cement or other materials  through which rodents cannot gnaw. Clear brush,  grass, trash and other debris around the foundations  of your home. (Also good advice for wildfire control.)

Outpost Ice Arena Looking for Host Families  By Aaron Martinez, Outpost Ice Arena manager    The New Mexico Ice Wolves™ team is seeking local families with a bit of extra room in their hearts and homes.  North American Hockey League (NAHL) Junior hockey cannot exist without the backbone of strong host fami- lies. Every season, young men between 16 and 20 years old will be moving to Albuquerque from all over the US,  Canada and Europe to play for the NM Ice Wolves and continue building on their dream of playing NCAA Division  I hockey and beyond. Host families provide a caring, supportive, family environment that becomes the “home  away from home” for players. Hosting a player can be an exciting and rewarding experience that often leads  to lifelong friendships between the player and his host family.  With the age range of 16-20 years old some players are still in high school while others are encouraged by the  team to take college prep courses and work part time jobs. To learn more about how to become a host family  and see answers to frequently asked questions, please visit: https://www.nmicewolves.com/you-can-make-a- difference-become-a-new-mexico-ice-wolves-host-family.  9 The GRIT - August 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 8 10 The GRIT - August 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 8 11   The GRIT – August 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 8  Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
