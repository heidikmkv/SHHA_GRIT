    Changes Coming to the Quail Run Center  By Bob Bower, Architectural Control Committee Chair    The Quail Run Center, located at Tramway Blvd. and San Rafael Ave., has  been sold. You will soon notice significant upgrades to the property, includ- ing a name change to Sandia Heights Village. The new owner says the goal  is to create a more contemporary and upscale building and property.  Changes include repainting the entire structure, removing and replacing  deteriorated landscaping, and repairing the parking area. In addition, the  sign will be replaced with a new and more attractive sign. The current ATM  will remain on the property. SHHA’s Architectural Control Committee will  be working with the new owner and will include periodic updates in The  GRIT and on the SHHA website on the progress of the upgrades.      Light Pollution  (Excerpted from Nov 2013 GRIT at request of Bob Thomas, CSC Chair)   By Joe Pappe, CSC Chair at time of original publication    Most of the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants address light pollution. This is  to preserve enjoyment of a dark night sky. Regardless of the covenants for  your Unit, the entirety of North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights falls  under the Bernalillo County Code for light pollution. The code includes, but  is not restricted to, security lighting, street lights, landscape lights, building- mounted area lights, and building façade lights. In general, lights shall re- main OFF between 11:00 PM and sunrise; lights on buildings shall be  mounted no higher than 16 feet; lights must be shielded so the light is di- rected toward the ground. The entire code and any exceptions are on the  Bernalillo County website (www.bernco.gov); look under ordinances, Sec- tion 30-186. So, if you leave unshielded lights on—entry, garage doors,  house floods—after 11:00 PM, they may be in violation of County Code.  While the CSC does not enforce County ordinances, we work with folks to  make them aware of the options and try to get resolution. At night, even  an unshielded 40-watt bulb can distract from enjoying the night sky, the  darkness of the neighborhood, or the lights of the city below.

By Bob Bower, Architectural Control Committee Chair    It’s always helpful this time of the year to remind you of ways to protect your water pipes from the effects of very  cold weather. Most of the local experts on this subject generally agree that steps need to be taken to protect  water pipes if temperatures are expected to drop below 21° Fahrenheit. A broken water pipe inside your home  can cause a lot of extensive—and expensive—damage!  Let’s start with the outside of your home. Disconnecting water hoses and protecting outdoor water faucets  are very important. Water that freezes in outdoor hoses connected to faucets causes a buildup of pressure on  interior plumbing that can result in a rupture of the interior pipes if the pressure is too high. Damage to these  interior pipes near an outdoor water faucet is often difficult to repair due to the inaccessibility of these pipes.  Disconnecting hoses from outdoor faucets and protecting the faucets with hard foam insulating cups are good  ways to reduce the chance of damage to these water pipes that extend through your exterior walls. These inex- pensive foam cups can be purchased at home improvement or hardware stores and are easy to install. I’ve also  found that it is wise to wrap outdoor faucets with some insulation prior to placing the foam cup over the faucets,  particularly if any of the faucets are located on the north side of your home or are located in an area that does  not receive any winter sunshine. Also, if you have any water pipes that are located outside your home and exposed  to outside temperatures, you should consider using insulating tubes or heat tape around these exposed pipes.  Now, let’s consider the inside of your home. If Albuquerque experiences a spell of extremely cold weather  where temperatures, particularly at night, drop below the 21° F “benchmark,” leave the water supply line on at a  very slow drip rate somewhere inside your home. Water in slow motion is much less likely to freeze than water  that is motionless inside of a pipe. Normally, a faucet located far from where the water enters your home is the  one that you should use for this purpose. The cost of water used is insignificant compared to the cost of repairing  damage caused by a broken water line inside your home. Normally, these very cold spells don’t last long, so leav- ing an indoor faucet dripping for a few days and nights should get you through these spells until warmer temper- atures return.   If you are away from your home during the cold season, make sure that there is adequate heat inside your  home to prevent internal pipes from freezing. Even when trying to save energy costs, don’t turn the heat too far  down (experts recommend no lower than 55° F) and don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you have all of the  water lines properly drained. Believe me, I have seen the damage caused by pipes that have not been properly  drained and have subsequently burst inside a home where the heat has been turned off!    One final note for those of you who have swamp coolers. If you have not already done so, be sure to drain the  water reservoir and disconnect and drain the water-supply line. It doesn’t take much of a freeze to damage these  cooler components. And don’t forget to insulate that faucet, too.   Have a great winter!!                                3   The GRIT – November 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 11  Bagworms  By Travis Rich, Parks & Safety Committee Chair    Recently, some Sandia Heights residents have observed  an abundance of camouflaged cocoon-looking bags  hanging from trees. In reality, they were observing ‘Bag- worms.’ (See photo)  Bagworm caterpillars make distinctive 1–2” long spin- dle-shaped bags that hang from twigs of a variety of  trees and shrubs. They seem to prefer juniper, arborvi- tae, spruce, pine and cedar, but also attack deciduous  trees. Female moths cannot fly, but the larvae can dis- perse themselves. Small caterpillars can spin strands of  silk and be carried by wind—an activity called “balloon- ing”. Larger larvae may crawl to adjacent plants.  Description and Habits: Bagworms pass the winter as  eggs (300+) inside bags that served as cocoons for last  year’s females. The eggs hatch in mid-May to mid-June  and the tiny larvae crawl out to feed. Each uses silk and  bits of plant material to make a small bag that protects  and camouflages itself during feeding and growth.  Bagworm caterpillars feed for about six weeks, en- larging their own bag as they grow and withdrawing  into it when disturbed. Older larvae can strip evergreens  of their needles and devour whole leaves of susceptible  deciduous plants, leaving only the larger leaf veins.   Heavy infestations over several consecutive years, espe- cially if coupled with other stresses such as drought, can  lead to plant death.  In early fall, the mature larvae attach their bags to  twigs and transform into the pupa or resting stage be- fore becoming an adult. Males emerge from bags in  early fall. They search for bags containing immobile fe- males. After mating, the female lays several hundred  eggs inside her bag, leaves the bag and dies. The eggs  remain in the bag until they hatch the following spring  and start the cycle again.  Bagworm Control: If only a few small trees or shrubs  are infested, one can hand pick and destroy attached  bags. This must be done during fall, winter or very early  spring before the eggs hatch.   When dealing with larger trees or heavy infestations,  an insecticide may be needed to prevent serious dam- age. The best time to apply an insecticide is while the  larvae are small (less than ½-inch long), usually in late  May to early June. The small larvae are more vulnerable  to insecticides, and feeding damage is relatively minor.  A nursery can advise you on an appropriate insecticide.  If you do nothing, you will be leaving the whole thing  up to the birds!   Treatment for bagworms is not difficult so long as  you approach this task at the right time in the bagworm  life cycle.

Speeding on Neighborhood Streets  By David Wilson, SHHA member  (originally published on Nextdoor.com, Oct 15.  Used with permission.)    Just now, standing in the park at Cedar Hill and  Tramway, I watched a school bus let out its kids. As  the bus started to pull away, a woman in a little SUV  zipped around the bus and sped up the hill. The speed  limit there is 15 mph. A little while earlier, I watched a  guy in a red Viper swoop down to Tramway at about  50 mph. I guess they think they (or the people they  might run over) are invincible. The selfishness of  some people is truly awe inspiring.    9 The GRIT - November 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 11 10 The GRIT - November 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 11 11   The GRIT – November 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 11  Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
