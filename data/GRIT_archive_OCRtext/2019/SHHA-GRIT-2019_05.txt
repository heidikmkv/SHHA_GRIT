    Answers to Questions from the 2019 Annual Meeting  By Woody Farber, SHHA President    Dear Mr. Wavrik,  At SHHA's Annual Meeting on February 9, 2019, you submitted several  questions regarding the goatscaping test project.  The questions and answers are as follows:  1. Are we spending SHHA’s money to clear private property? Yes. The Board  approved $1500 for a test project to use goats to clear vegetation.  2. Was one of the benefiting homeowners on the Board? No Board member  owned property in the test area.  3. Since only branches/grasses were eaten they will come back. What are  the criteria for success? The goats cleared 50+% of the vegetation in the  test area, which created several clear spaces in the previously solidly  packed vegetation, which will help to slow fire and provides areas to get  in and fight fire. It was never expected that all the vegetation would be  cleared.  4. The vegetation will grow back, as it would no matter what process was  used to clear the area. If no clearing is done there will be even more veg- etation for fires to use as fuel. Goatscaping is considered a safe way to  clear vegetation since there are no sparks that could cause a fire in a dry  environment and there is no trash to be hauled to a landfill.  This was a test project by SHHA to see if this process would be an option  for homeowners in Sandia Heights. It is one of several options to choose  from.

Rich, Parks & Safety Committee Chair    Following are highlights extracted from comments by Lt  Brian Fox, Albuquerque Fire & Rescue, and Chief Brian  Rose, Bernalillo County Fire & Rescue, during the March  Fire Risk Management Seminars hosted by SHHA.  Things to do to reduce risk to your home:  • Store flammable material away from the house. Exam- ples are firewood, flammable liquids such as gasoline,  and paint.  • Periodically clear gutters and roofs of pine needles,  leaves and other debris.  • Create a buffer zone by removing weeds, brush, and  other flammable vegetation around your home.  • Reduce the amount of unmanaged vegetation be- tween and around homes to decrease the risk of wild- fire spreading throughout the community.  • Trim plants up off of the ground to minimize the  chance a creeping ground fire will ignite top growth  and become a crown fire, which increases the oppor- tunity for wind-blown embers.  Home evacuations:  • Have an evacuation plan   • Cooperate with officials, and honor barricades  • Leave a note on the door informing the officials as to  how many people vacated the home and their names,  and provide a friend/relative’s contact information.  This is extremely helpful to officials in their efforts to  account for those having to evacuate.   • If comfortable, you should leave your door unlocked  in case officials need to enter your property.  • Take your pets.  • Take adequate medications for a potential 2-3 day ab- sence.  Things to do prior to evacuation:  • Turn off the gas supply to your home.  • Do not turn on sprinklers (this action lowers water  pressure available for fighting the fire).  • For homes with evaporative coolers, turn off the fan  (which pulls in added heat), leave the water pump run- ning to wet down cooler pads (helps add moisture to  the interior).  • Close windows and pull shades. This action reduces ra- diative heat that can ignite the interior. If your home  has a flammable drapes or shades, leave those raised  to minimize chances of them combusting.  • If the home has solar panels, shut them down prior to  evacuation. Solar panels could feed the surrounding  energy supply.  Both Fire & Rescue officials stressed that it is the home- owner’s responsibility to police themselves for reducing  fire risk to their property.  (Part 2 will be in next month’s GRIT.)    Fire Prevention Seminar  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    SHHA’s Parks and Safety Committee sponsored a fire  prevention seminar on March 19, 20 and 21. Subjects cov- ered included responses to a fire in Sandia Heights, evac- uation and notification efforts, mitigation of home risks,  and post-fire recovery. During some of these discussions,  attendees asked questions regarding how SHHA’s Archi- tectural Control Committee (ACC) would handle resident  requests associated with reducing the amount of com- bustible material in the vicinity of their homes. I ad- dressed this issue in my April 2018 GRIT article following  a similar series of wildfire preparedness briefings last  year, but I will address the issue again in this article.  Most of SHHA’s unit covenants state that “natural  vegetation is to be left undisturbed where practical on  all lots except for access to the property, clearing of  building sites, and establishment of lawns and flower  beds adjacent to buildings.” In addition, the ACC has  published a Design Guideline for Landscaping which  makes the following points:  1. Sandia Heights is based on an open-space concept  where natural vegetation is of great importance. Deed  restrictions require that natural vegetation be left undis- turbed where possible and replenished after construc- tion is finished.  2. Residents are asked to keep their properties clear  of dead trees and other vegetation since this dead mate- rial is easily combustible.  The key here is the use of the terms “where practical”  and “where possible.” These terms give you the flexibil- ity to make fire-wise decisions based on your perception  of the damage to your property that could occur as a re- sult of a local wildfire. Although the ACC discourages a  “bare earth” policy as it pertains to the removal of vege- tation on your property, reducing the amount of com- bustible materials and clearing dead vegetation from ar- eas in the vicinity of your residence make good sense and  the ACC will certainly support your attempts to help mit- igate the risk to your home through reasonable elimina- tion of combustible vegetation.  3   The GRIT – May 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 5  The Outpost Ice Arena—  New Owner, Big Changes  By Susan McCasland, Communications &   Publications Committee Chair      Last August, Stan Hubbard bought the Outpost Ice  Arena from retiring long-time owner Bob Martin.  Since then he has been renovating and updating the  Outpost: cleaning, painting, installing LED lights, re- placing fixtures and plumbing, installing a sound sys- tem and new restaurant equipment, new rental  skates and a spiffy pro shop—all in all, the Outpost is  getting a thorough makeover. At the moment, the  Outpost is closed because all the ice is gone for the  first time in many years, allowing the floor to be re- leveled. The Outpost reopens with new ice on May 15.  But perhaps the biggest change is the New Mexico  Ice Wolves, a North American Hockey League team  that will call The Outpost home. NAHL is an amateur  youth league that fosters promising players age 20  and younger who have the potential to play at the col- lege level. In addition to a lot of time on the ice, the  young players also get help with academics. On aver- age, about 13 players per team are selected each year  for college hockey. The Ice Wolves will play 30 home  games and 30 away games each season, starting in Oc- tober. With games being on Friday and Saturday  nights, there will be 15 game weekends a season at  The Outpost. Stan expects about 800 to 1000 people  at each game.   Stan hopes his neighbors in Sandia Heights will  come by to watch a hockey game, try some skating, or  just sample the good food in the new snack bar.    Choice Plants and Rabbit Food  By Jean Hefflin  (Reprinted from February 1989 GRIT)    Do you love those jack rabbits that seem able to leap  tall buildings in a single bound? And those cuddly cot- tontails that look so timid but will wait for you to walk  on top of them before they deign even to move, let  alone stop munching on your favorite plant? Is there  any way to coexist peacefully with them and still have  a garden an area that by covenant protects its wild- life?  My friends in the know say that rabbits will eat  ANYTHING at one stage or another, no plant is really  rabbit PROOF. However, clearly they prefer plants  that you just put out, young, tender and well-watered.  When you put out plants in an unprotected area,  cover then [sic] with wire mesh till they’ve grown a bit  and, when their leaves are older and tougher, maybe  the bunnies will let them be.  … The bed in front of my house has had bulbs, co- toneasters, annuals, ox-eye daisies and succulents  grazed to the ground while lemonade bush, lambs  ears, wild onions, barberrries [sic], snow-in-summer,  and bush mint have been ignored. I’ve had pretty  good luck with some penstemons. … Bearded iris  seems to be immune, too (so far).  The rabbits are sensible to the desert plant protec- tions of thorns but there isn’t just cactus and yucca to  choose from for the garden. Consider barberries.  There is a beautiful big native, called algerita (berberis  trifoliolata), that is appearing in nurseries. There are  large old plants on Hwy. 14 that are covered with yel- low flowers in the spring. ...  Plants with strong or bitter taste are low on Lepus’  and friends’ favorite food list. Why else is the snake- weed so common on our land?...it tastes TERRIBLE.  (Though the Albuquerque Journal recently reported  hopefully that camels might like it!) Sages, too are  common on the desert for good reason. The artemi- sias are not called wormwood for nothing …. Yarrows  and mints are possibilities, too. There is a beautiful  bush mint (Poliomintha incana) with pale to sky blue  flowers that I saw blooming near the Zia Pueblo that  looks like a good bet. Again—once it’s established.  Our friend says she has had good luck using rabbit  repellent on her plants. I haven’t tried it much—I’m  still looking for local answers, if any. Meanwhile, as  Marie A. would have said if she’s [sic] lived here, “Let  ‘em eat rabbit-bush!”  4   The GRIT – May 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 5  MARCH CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

My curiosity got the best of  me so I thought I would look into the whole subject of  lighting. I’ll address his concerns later.  We all know that Thomas Edison, after years of exper- iments, finally patented a commercially available incan- descent light bulb in 1879. It was a simple device that  had a tungsten metal filament inside of a glass vacuum  that glowed when an electrical current was run through  it. That accomplishment essentially snuffed out the can- dle industry. For the better part of the last century, Edi- son’s bulb was about the only type of electrically pow- ered device that was available for our lighting needs.  Well, how things have changed! We now have a wide va- riety of light-emitting devices available to assist us with  our lighting needs. Many of these devices are more en- ergy-efficient than their incandescent ancestors. These  include fluorescents, halogens, light-emitting diodes  (LED) and a few others that have been developed to ad- dress specific lighting requirements. So, let me take a  few moments to discuss some of the terminology asso- ciated with these new lighting devices.  We all know that a 100-watt incandescent bulb is  brighter than, say, a 40-watt bulb. Most of us grew up  with these types of light bulbs. A watt is a measure of  the electrical output of these types of bulbs—the higher  the wattage, the more light the bulb produces. So far, so  good, right? When you go to Lowe’s or Home Depot to  buy something other than a standard incandescent bulb  because your new appliance uses a LED or compact flu- orescent light (CFL), the output power of the device is  often measured in lumens. I can just hear you saying,  “What is this lumen stuff?” Let’s go back to those candle  guys. Greatly simplified, a lumen is the amount of light  emitted in one second from a referenced candle source.  That’s all you need to know. In terms of equivalency, a  standard 100-watt incandescent bulb puts out about  1300 lumens, as does a 20-watt CFL or an 18-watt LED.  Some packaging will actually show the watts-to-lumens  equivalency values.    Image courtesy of lampsone.com    So, let’s get back to my fellow resident’s comments.  There is one more term in the lighting world that I need  to discuss. This term is called the Kelvin scale. We all  know that the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales measure  temperatures that we can actually feel. The Kelvin scale,  on the other hand, measures temperatures that we can  see. In the world of lighting, the Kelvin scale (often ex- pressed as “K”) is used to measure the color of a light  source. The lower the K rating, the more orange/yellow  (warmer) the light will be. The higher the K rating, the  more bluish, or cooler, the light will be. The chart below  shows the range of the Kelvin color temperature scale.      Image courtesy of ilumi.co    A candle has a rating of about 1000K and the standard  incandescent bulb has a rating of about 2700K. Halogen  and some incandescent lights are in the 3000–3500K  range. On the upper end of the scale, a clear blue sky has  a K rating of 10,000. Now let’s go back to Lowe’s and  Home Depot. When shopping for outdoor security lights  or floodlights, I have observed two basic color ratings.  There are those in the 5000K range and those in the  2700–3000K range. The former devices emit a bluish and  very bright light. These devices often shine considerably  beyond areas that need to be lit from  a  security  stand-  Continued from pg. 7  8   The GRIT – May 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 5    point. Those devices in the 2700–3000K range give  off a yellow-white light that is easier on the eyes  than the devices that have the bluish output, and  they are less likely to shine beyond the area that ac- tually needs to be illuminated. These yellow-white  lights also provide a more pleasing light that blends  in better with our natural surroundings here in San- dia Heights. Bottom line: My fellow resident would  greatly appreciate it if you would install security  lights with the lower K ratings. They will most likely  meet your security needs and, at the same time,  will not cause undue light pollution that appears to  be associated with the higher K- rated lights. Also  bear in mind that installation of any outdoor light- ing requires ACC approval so that you follow your  unit covenants and Bernalillo County light pollution  ordinances. The covenants and the County ordi- nances require that your outdoor light fixtures do  not cast light onto neighboring residences.
