          2018 Annual Meeting Netted Results  By Hugh Prather, Community Services & Membership Committee Chair      The February 2018 annual meeting of the SHHA was a substantial departure  from prior practices. Under the leadership of meeting planning chairperson,  Emily Rudin, a very different type of event occurred. After a short session of  regular business during which the Association reported activities from the  prior year, a facilitator took attendees through several small-group  interactive sessions where members were able to discuss topics of interest.  Some very interesting follow-ups have taken place.  Attendees expressed continuing interest in having the Association  improve its service to the membership. An initial way to accomplish that was  too reach out to the entire SHHA membership through a first-annual SHHA  Community Survey to identify community-wide priorities and establish  benchmarks. The survey had over 700 responses from SHHA members and  provided a solid starting point for planning to help your Association become  even more responsive to the needs of its members. Several examples that  came from that work are reported below.  Much of the work of the Association is accomplished through standing  committees that address community-wide needs, such as the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC), the Architectural Control Committee (ACC), and  the Parks & Safety Committee (PSC). Each of these is made up of volunteers  from your Board and from the community. Each committee reviewed the  Annual Survey results and identified specific tasks to accomplish.  Another result of the 2018 Annual Meeting was the reestablishment of  the Community Service & Membership Committee (CS&MC). The CS&MC  had been moribund for several years; its main purpose had been to identify  projects to support and grow the membership. One result from the new  CS&MC was the certification of both SHHA office staff members as voter  registrars prior to the 2018 election making it possible for people to register  to vote at the SHHA office rather than making a trip downtown.   Hopefully you will mark your calendar for February 9, 2019, and plan to  attend and participate with your friends, neighbors, and fellow Sandia  Heights community members in building a stronger community and  continuing to make Sandia Heights a wonderful place to live.

Please plan to attend and make your input known.     Sandia Heights Posted Speed Limits  By the Parks & Safety Committee     The Parks & Safety Committee is aware of comments  and concerns about the speed at which drivers negoti- ate the down slope of San Rafael. The purpose of this  article is to address what can, or cannot, be done to get  folks to get where they want to go, but to do so at a  speed that does not endanger themselves as drivers  and others as pedestrians out for a stroll or just “walk- ing-the-dog.”  As you all know, San Rafael is a relatively narrow  road that winds around side hills and up and down gul- lies as it meanders down the west slope of the Sandias.  There are no sidewalks for pedestrian use. Thus, the  street serves multiple purposes.    There are speed-limit signs, speed bumps, cul-de- sacs, and even stop signs in place. However, we still  have speeders. Experience shows that when the mass- es want something to happen, they generally find a way  to make it happen. Do we want a community of safe  driving? Do we want to share the road? If so, perhaps it  is the time to place much of the responsibility on our- selves! In other words, do we want safety enough that  we are willing to police ourselves? Obeying posted  speed limits is a logical place to start!  One option is to bring attention to those exceeding a  safe speed by recording the identification of the speed- er (license plate number, date and time). Should the  vehicle be a commercial one, the name of the company  would also be useful. A call to the company with infor- mation that one of their vehicles was being operating in  a careless manner at a specific date, time, and place  would surely get the attention of the company, or resi- dent.    As individuals living in the Sandia Heights, let’s ob- serve posted speed limits and respect pedestrians that  may be just around the next blind corner. Let us all  ‘think safe’ and thus get to our final destination on  time!                3   The GRIT – January 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 1   You, the SHHA, Covenant Enforcement  By the Covenant Support Committee    Who can report a violation? First of all, you must be a  property owner in Sandia Heights and be a member  of SHHA in order to submit a covenant violation  form. This form (Report of Suspected Covenant Viola- tion) is available at the SHHA office and from the  SHHA website. Your anonymity as the complainant  will be shielded unless future court action requires  that your identity be revealed. Historically, court ac- tions of this nature are very rare. Any SHHA member  may submit a covenant violation form, however, the  CSC normally will act on submissions from residents  in the same Unit where the violation exists, in an ad- jacent Unit, or in direct line-of-sight of the violation  regardless of the Unit you reside in. The CSC will ex- ercise its discretion as to whether or not to act on  violations outside of the normal guidelines.  What information is needed on the violation form?  Information regarding you as the complainant is on  the form since the CSC may want to contact you for  additional details related to your complaint. The spe- cific violation and its location need to be identified,  along with the rationale supporting your belief that a  violation has occurred. It also helps to identify the  specific paragraph in the applicable Unit covenants  that you think is being violated. The form asks if you  have contacted the violator, but this contact is not a  requirement in order to submit the form. The CSC is  very sensitive about not creating an adversarial rela- tionship between the complainant and the violator.  You may choose to talk to your neighbor to try to re- solve the violation first, but as stated previously, the  CSC does not require this one-on-one contact. The  last item required is your signature on the form. The  SHHA staff will recognize electronic signatures that  include the member’s e-mail address. The CSC will  not respond to complaints submitted by phone calls,  notes, or anonymously.  How does the CSC handle the complaint? A mem- ber of the CSC will be assigned to investigate the  complaint and to try to resolve it. The member first  assesses the validity of the complaint by verifying the  information submitted on the violation form. If the  complaint is deemed invalid the complainant will be  notified by mail and the file will be closed. If it is clear  that a valid violation exists, the CSC member will con- tact the alleged violator either in person, by phone,  or by mail and complete an investigative report. The  violator will receive written notification from the CSC  regarding the specific violation and will be given a  reasonable deadline by which to remedy it. The  member will follow up with the violator to ensure  that the violation is corrected in accordance with the  stated timeline. If the violation is successfully re- solved at this point, both parties will be notified by  mail and the file will be closed. If, however, the viola- tion is not resolved as a result of the first letter, a  second letter will be sent to the violator with an ad- ditional timeline for resolution and a warning that  failure to comply may result in legal action. If the  second letter is unsuccessful in solving the violation,  the file will be turned over to the SHHA attorney for  further action. Don’t put yourself in this latter posi- tion by disregarding these letters—it’s expensive for  both you and the community to pursue legal action!  Why should you care about covenant enforce- ment? Resident surveys conducted over the years  have consistently indicated that the primary goal of  SHHA should be the enforcement of our covenants.  The covenants were designed to benefit all property  owners in Sandia Heights in order to preserve and  maintain the beauty, quality of life, and property val- ues in this unique community. The SHHA and the CSC  actively seek your support for the enforcement of  our covenants. This is your community and your cov- enants—take them seriously!

The pub had its grand opening on November 30. The  brewpub is associated with Boese Brothers Brewing  downtown, which supplies the craft brews for the local  pub. I sat down with co-owner George Boese and local  manager Lexi Palmer to learn what brought them to  our neighborhood and what their plans are.   George mentioned that Boese Brothers was looking  to expand and noticed, in an otherwise brewery- saturated city, that this corner of it was underserved. In  fact, the nearest brewpub was about a 15-minute drive  away. They wanted a location that nearby residents  could walk to. A vacancy in the little strip mall on  Tramway between the Valvoline and the CVS seemed  perfect. And Lexi said she loves our beautiful area and  wants to get to know the people who live here.  The interior shows that love. George built a lot of the  furnishings himself, designing a comfortable space out  of the empty shell of a former nail salon. And, of  course, the brothers George, Sam and James are pas- sionate about brewing. In addition to the neighbor- hood pub and the original brewery downtown on Gold  Avenue, the brothers have partnered with New Mexico  Hard Cider in the Desert Dogs Brewery and Cidery near  the Plaza in Santa Fe. But it’s not all about the beer.  They also serve a full menu; so the pub is kid friendly.  I asked their plans for the future. George said it’s the  food. Their chef, who currently makes a large selection  of sandwiches, wants to expand into making seasonal  specialties. Beyond that, they’re still getting their feet  wet and seeing what works well and what doesn’t. Ex- pect a bit of experimentation in the next few weeks  and months.  Drop in and say “hi” to Lexi and, maybe, George. A  pint might go down well, too.

By Susan McCasland, Comm & Pubs Committee    Rolling over the volume number on the January front  page to 35, a natural conclusion was that The GRIT is  turning 35 years old. ♫ Happy birthday to The GRIT,  happy birthday……not so fast. Because it’s not that  simple. The obvious first stumbling block is that there  are newsletters in the archive back to 1979 and no  indication that the earliest one, a May 6, 1979, “San- dia GRIT,” is the first. Those early ones don’t have any  volume numbers. Then the name changed to the  concise “Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  Newsletter,” still without volume numbers, through  mid-1984. Ah ha! (Danger! Public math, here):  2019 – 1984 = 35!  The October SHHA Newsletter, now called “THE  GRIT,” was Vol 1, No. 1, but Vol 1 continued through- out 1985 and 1986, changing to Vol 2 in March 1987. In  1988 and through the ’90s, the volume number was  the same as the year, e.g., Vol 99. Our archive is  missing from Y2K to the electronic versions on the  website starting in Jan 2014 (Vol 30, No. 1). So let’s  call that Vol 1, No. 1, Oct 1984 newsletter the first  GRIT. Here’s most of the front page:  The stated purposes of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association are to promote the common interests and  welfare of the homeowners of record located in the Sandia  Heights development of the County of Bernalillo, New  Mexico. … A number of objectives have been decided upon  for the 1984-85 association year. … Here is a list of objectives:  1. Achieve a minimum membership of 50% by April 1, 1985.  2. Seek improved conditions on Tramway Boulevard, e.g.  stacking lanes and traffic control lights at Spain and Los  Angeles [now Paseo del Norte].  3. Publish a Resident Directory containing names and ad- dresses of all Sandia Heights residents and distribute to  association members only.  4. Develop a plan for relieving Sandia Peak Tram Company of  covenant monitoring tasks by June 30, 1985.  5. Seek an informal agreement with the North Albuquerque  Acres and North Glenwood Hills associations to collectively  pursue projects of common interest in the North Tramway  Boulevard area, e.g. Tramway Boulevard improvements.  6. Initiate association-sponsored events for the benefit of  Sandia Heights residents, e.g. bicycle race for various age  groups and a Christmas home decoration contest.  7. Expand upon the neighborhood coffee program as the  nucleus of a welcoming program for new residents.  8. The association may administer and enforce covenants  relating to the architecture and appearance of the devel- opment, and may perform certain maintenance and care  for the common areas of the development.  …The annual membership meeting in June [1985] includes a  Report of the President. His report will deal largely with our  degree of success in attaining the above objectives.    9 The GRIT - January 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 1 10 The GRIT - January 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 1 11   The GRIT – January 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 1  Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
