    SHHA’s Clock Is Ticking…  By Emily Rudin, Vice President and Chair, Nominating Committee    For several months now, in The GRIT and on SHHA’s website, I have been  calling for candidates for SHHA’s Board of Directors. As of this writing, I am  disappointed to report that there has been only one response from our  roughly 3,000 members.  I cannot overemphasize the risk to SHHA’s viability this situation poses.  We are now just eight weeks away from a deadline to nominate a qualified  and vetted Board and slate of officers for February 2020 and the outyears.  This group of member volunteers commits to stewardship and oversight of  the operations and finances which SHHA, by its Articles of Incorporation and  Bylaws, is mandated to manage in the best possible manner. In addition,  challenges large and small routinely arise and must be resolved fairly and  effectively.  The current Board consists of 13 Directors, several of whose terms will  expire in February. We must have a minimum of 11 in order to transact busi- ness. One does not need sophisticated math to grasp the deficit we are fac- ing. Most of you will recognize that this is the same predicament we (and I  as Vice President and Nominating Committee Chair then) confronted head- on two years ago. I should not like to think that apathy once again charac- terizes our wonderful community.  I ask each of you this question: Do you value Sandia Heights enough to  want the Association to continue? Before you answer, consider this: SHHA’s  mission is to help preserve the worth of your most precious investment— your property—and sustain our collective investment in one of Albuquer- que’s most sought-after communities. This is neither a trivial responsibility,  nor one to take for granted that “others” will carry out. There are no “oth- ers”—we who serve are YOU.  You might be wondering what will happen if SHHA ceases to operate. Be- cause the Association’s work is intimately tied to property values, you will  almost certainly see a dramatic downturn. SHHA’s core functions of cove- nant enforcement and architectural control will be impaired. Are you willing  to place the value of your property at risk?  Please think about your willingness and your ability to serve. If you are a  member of SHHA and in good standing, a property-owner in Sandia Heights,  and committed to understanding and upholding the Bylaws, we would ap- preciate hearing from you soon. Submit to the Office a Statement of Interest  (download it under the Board tab on our website or obtain it from the Of- fice). Thank you.

Bobcats  By Kate Fry, SHHA Member    Of all the large predators living in or near Sandia Heights  (aside from humans, of course, we have mountain lions,  black bears, bobcats, and coyotes), the one we often  see is the bobcat (Lynx rufus). The wild predators have  lived here for eons, but only recently have humans in- vaded their territory by building houses and paving  streets. It’s up to us to adapt to living in wildlife habitat,  and that means we may need to change our habits in  order to coexist with our wild neighbors.   Like all predators, bobcats are territorial, and typi- cally have ranges of 4 to 10 square miles. They are soli- tary, with males and females meeting only for mating.  Kittens are born in the spring and stay with their mother  for 9 to 12 months. About twice as large as a domestic  house cat, bobcats usually weigh 15–30 pounds when  fully grown. The bobcat gets its common name from its  short “bobbed” tail, 4 to 7 inches long. It has long legs  and big paws. The coat color ranges from an orangish  brown to pale gray with black spots and black bars on  its legs and chest, and less distinct dark spots over its  body. They have black streaks on their cheeks and sharp  ears ending in tufts of black fur. Bobcats’ diet includes  rabbits, mice, packrats, squirrels, birds, and sometimes  insects. They rely on their keen eyesight and hearing to  locate enemies and prey, as their sense of smell is not  especially acute. Bobcats hunt by stealth—waiting mo- tionless and then pouncing.   Bobcats pose no threat to humans, but they have  been known to take domestic cats and small dogs. Keep  small dogs indoors and watch them carefully when they  are out of doors. Cats should always be kept inside, as  they will fall prey to bobcats and other predators like  coyotes, owls, and hawks, and may also become in- fected with plague if they catch infected rodents.   If you see a bobcat, unless they appear injured or in  distress, there’s no need to call Animal Control or Game  and Fish. Just enjoy the sight of these fascinating and  beautiful creatures. If you would prefer not to have bob- cats in your yard, then you should remove anything that  might attract them, like bird baths, water features, and  bird seed. Water is an obvious attractant; bird seed at- tracts the animals bobcats eat, and bobcats go where  the food is.   We hope that a better understanding of bobcats will  help Sandia Heights residents happily coexist with  them. They are truly amazing and magnificent members  of our wild neighborhood.

Many residents in Sandia Heights hire companies  for remodeling projects.  It would be helpful if all con- tractors were reminded to be careful when driving  through Sandia Heights.  In early May a sub-contractor  was delivering dry wall to a property being remodeled  down the street from our home.  The truck driver  drove past the property and then decided to turn  around in a loop street that adjoined the main street  in front of our home.  The driver was going too fast  and was not paying attention to the dimensions of his  truck and trailer.  His carelessness totally destroyed  our custom-built stucco mailbox.  Even worse, the  trucker just kept going.  If a neighbor had not noticed  the mailbox on our driveway and walked down to the  remodeling location and if an honest homeowner and  the manager from the remodeling company had not  been there to observe the truck’s arrival with a big  stucco smear from our mailbox, we never would have  known what happened.  Fortunately, the truck driver  was forced to admit what he did, and his company did  the right thing and rebuilt our mailbox, even though  they rebuilt it with cracked tiles and omitted some of  the original decorative tiles, though we told them we  had extra tiles, if needed. The sad thing is that this de- struction should never have happened.  Perhaps a  word of caution to contractors as they begin projects  might serve to prevent such future incidents.      Ten3 Restaurant is Open!  By Susan McCasland, C&P Committee Chair    Ten3, the new restaurant at the top of the tram— named for its altitude above sea level—opened on Au- gust 17. It replaces the ’60s-era High Finance, which  was closed and demolished in 2016. The new 2-story  building that has emerged in its place houses Ten3. It  features fine dining with a view over the Rio Grande  Valley, a wine lounge overlooking the ski area, and a  bar bistro area that welcomes hikers, skiers and other  casual visitors. For more information, please visit  https://ten3tram.com/      West view side of new Ten3 Restaurant (From their Facebook page)      Fall Bear Alert    We’ll soon be in the season when bears are trying to  pack on the pounds to make it through their winter  hibernation. Bears usually go into dens in November,  so please until then continue to be vigilant.   • Keep garbage inside and put it outside no ear- lier than the morning of your trash pickup.   • Don’t feed your pets outside.   • Bring bird feeders inside at night. Bears will de- molish empty bird feeders—they know those  things usually have birdseed in them, and they  will go after feeders even if they are empty.   • Keep ripe fruit picked and clean up fallen fruit.  Above all, enjoy the privilege of living in this beautiful  area and sometimes getting a glimpse of our wild  neighbors!    4   The GRIT – September 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 9  JULY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

It’s Chile Harvest Time  By Susan McCasland, C&P Committee Chair    It’s that time of year when the wonderful smell of  roasting chiles permeates the air. I’ll soon be making  my annual pilgrimage to my favorite farmers’ market  to get a bushel of chiles and have them roasted.   Here’s a hint for peeling those chiles. But first—and  I know many of you have already made this mistake,  myself included, but if you haven’t—heed these words.  Do NOT peel spicy hot chiles with your bare hands and  especially do not rub your eyes! If you do, you have in  essence pepper sprayed yourself. Rubber gloves will  protect from the capsaicin (the chemical “heat” in  chiles), but do not allow for the dexterity needed. An  old and quite effective way to peel chiles is to rub your  hands in lard. Yes, lard. When you feel the lard coating  wearing thin, put more on. It is quite effective in shield- ing your hands from the burn, and very little gets into  the peeled chiles.  Here’s a recipe for chile rellenos that does not in- volve frying the rellenos. It’s more like a casserole.  • Line the bottom of a greased casserole with a layer  of roasted & peeled NM chiles such as Big Jim  • Make the next layer grated or crumbled Mexican  cheese: queso fresco, panela, etc.  • Sprinkle with ¼ cup diced sweet onion  • Repeat layers like a lasagna, ending with chiles  • Whip 2 egg whites until they make soft peaks  • Whip into the egg whites 2 egg yolks, ½ cup milk, ½  cup flour, ¼ teaspoon salt  • Pour the egg mixture over the chile casserole  • Bake at 350° F for 30 minutes or until top starts to  brown  • Serve with salsa and sour cream  Not Too Big, Not Too Small  Historical article reprinted from April 1989 GRIT    All around us in the Sandias, shrubs are growing that  are adaptable to our gardens and that live happily here  in our dry climate and sandy Sandia soil. Two favorites  are large saxifrages – cliff fendlerbush (fendlera rupi- cola) and our fragrant native mockorange (philadel- phus microphylla). Saxifrage means rock breaker and in  spring you can see these good-sized shrubs with their  large white blooms growing in the rocks in Juan Tabo  Canyon and beneath the tram as you ride up the moun- tain. Both are handsome shrubs with large (1”) flowers  in the spring, the shape of the fendlerbush flowers be- ing unusually attractive. The lovely wild currants and  gooseberries are also in this family. Six are listed for the  Sandias, but the native ribes found most frequently in  the nurseries is the attractive golden currant with pro- fuse small yellow flowers and golden fruit. It has been  a successful landscape plant.  Any of our gardens can use the New Mexico native  sumac, lemonade berry (rhus trilobata). It has a variety  of names—oakbrush sumac, skunk bush. I planted a 1- gallon lemonade berry, gave it water from time to time  the first year and have forgotten it since. Now two  years later, it is a respectable 3’ shrub that turns a nice  gold and red in the fall before it drops its leaves. So far,  it has been ignored by the bunnies, but is beloved by  the birds who take its berries before I ever have a  chance to see them turn red. Eventually it should be 5  or 6 feet tall and at least as wide. Its pleasant cousin,  the wooly sumac (rhus trilobata pelosissima) grows in  many of our draws; look along lower Live Oak Road for  them. It turns a soft yellow in the fall. Though it seems  happily impervious to drought, it also apparently  thrives on extra water. One of mine got the drainage  from a new patio and had spread to about 12’ across  while staying about 6’ tall. In summer, it is usually filled  with birds that love its cover.  And, do you have a shady spot that freezes hard in  the winter that you have despaired of planting? You  might want to try the native red-twig dogwood. It is es- pecially beautiful in the winter against the snow and is  handsome the rest of the year as well, having white  flowers in the spring and a nice red color in the fall. It  comes from the high mountains so needs a bit more  water than some plants from lower elevations; it  would be happy on drip watering on a north side.

It’s Not Too Late to Be a Junior Hockey Host Family  By Aaron Martinez, Outpost Ice Arena manager  The New Mexico Ice Wolves™ team seeks local families with a bit of extra room in their hearts and homes. North  American Hockey League (NAHL) Junior hockey cannot exist without the backbone of strong host families.  Every season, young men 16 – 20 years old will be moving to Albuquerque from the US, Canada and Europe to  play for the NM Ice Wolves and build on their dream of playing NCAA Division I hockey and beyond. Host families  provide a caring, supportive, family environment that becomes the “home away from home” for players. Host- ing a player can be exciting and rewarding and often leads to lifelong friendships.  Some players are still in high school while others are encouraged by the team to take college prep courses  and work part time jobs.

Each small dinner group is typically 6-8 people, including the hosts.  We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the  menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal – along with a wine to go  with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller,  there are 2 whole group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The  dinner group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights  residents are welcome.
