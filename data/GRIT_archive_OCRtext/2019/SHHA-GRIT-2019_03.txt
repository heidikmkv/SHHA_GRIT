The final fi- nancial reports show Gross Income of  $210,846.45, Expenses of $203,767.13 and Other  Expenses of $1,776.87, resulting in a Net Income  of $5,302.45. The major differences between  budgeted and actual amounts were in additional  revenues from GRIT and Directory advertising,  but in addition all Committee Chairs managed  their budgets, which resulted in cost savings.    2019 Budget  o After reviewing the proposed 2019 budget at its  November 14, 2018 meeting, the Board ap- proved the budget as proposed by the Finance  Committee.  o The Finance Committee developed the budget  based on the current and projected reserves  and the revenues needed to cover the services  needed by the property owners.  o This allows for a reasonable targeted Net In- come of approximately $915.07. Each year the  income and expenses will be reviewed to estab- lish the best courses of action for the following  years.  o Budgets are projections which may change as  the year progresses, so please go to the Finance  tab on the Board section of the SHHA website  for current details.    Internal Review  o Each year members of the Finance Committee  review the major financial procedures to ensure  they are being followed.  o This past year members reviewed payroll,  QuickBooks, dues, petty cash, advertising, tram  passes, health insurance and security.  o While there were no major issues noted, several  improvements were identified, especially in the  area of security.  o Based on the reviews, the required annual re- port was prepared and submitted to the Execu- tive Committee for review and acceptance by  the President.    3   The GRIT – March 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 3  Annual Report from the Parks & Safety Commit- tee – Travis Rich, Chairman    Members:  Travis Rich, Chair  Barb Kelly  Martin Kirk  Burt O’Neil  Emily Rudin  Bill Wiley    Parks & Safety Annual Report:  o Acknowledge the resignation of Suzanne  Schneider after five years of service to our  committee.

Special Parks & Safety Projects  o In March 2018, a special committee was formed  for the specific purpose of developing a Wildfire  Preparedness Plan. Bill Wiley and Keith Julian  served as Co-Chairmen. Upon completion of their  challenge, the Wildfire Preparedness and Planning  Committee (WPPC) provided the P&S Committee  a document of 10 recommendations in September  2018. The special committee was dissolved. Action  has been taken on the majority of the recommen- dations. One of the visible successes of the WPPC  efforts was the highly attended seminars held July  24–26, 2018. A similar series of seminars will be  held March 19–21, 2019.    o A pilot project was conducted to determine the  effectiveness of grazing goats for the purpose of  removing excessive flammable organic material  located within the Sandia Heights community.  At  this point, the success and financial feasibility of  such project remains under study.  This subject is  proposed to be a part of one of the scheduled  sessions of wildfire risk seminar mentioned above.

George Connor, Ruth Haas and Patty Piasecki re- signed from the Committee.    Functions:   The CSC meets the first Tuesday of every month at  7:00 pm. Homeowners with questions or state- ments to make to the Committee are allotted five  minutes at the beginning of the meeting. Then the  doors are closed to maintain the confidentiality of  CSC business. Please notify the SHHA Office be- forehand.    Summary of Activities for 2018:  o There were 21 complaints handled by the CSC in  2018, including one carried over from 2017. All  were investigated by CSC members and rec- ommendations were made as to the validity of  the complaints with regard to the covenants  relevant to their units. Of these, 18 were closed  in 2018.  o For some complaints, the specific unit cove- nants do not cover or address the alleged viola- tion and there is nothing the CSC can do. The  valid complaints are mostly resolved between  SHHA and the homeowners. In very unusual  situations the SHHA attorney is consulted.    The CSC published the following articles in the  2018 GRIT:  Jan. – CSC Legal Action; Trash Cans  Feb. – CSC Covenant Reminder  Mar. – Annual Report from the Covenant Support  Committee  Apr. – Drones: An Update; File a Bernalillo county  Complaint Online, by Phone or In-person  Jun. – Summer is Here; Sandia Heights Lighting  Aug. – Being a Good Neighbor Dogs & Cats Edition  Sep. – Bernalillo County Code for Prohibited Uses  in a Single-Family Residential Zone  Oct. – Friendly Reminder About RVs  Dec. – Holiday Lighting & Parking Reminder    o The CSC currently has six members. They repre- sent a broad range of experience and are pas- sionate about enforcing the covenants and  maintaining our Sandia Heights values. We feel  we can adequately handle the current workload  with reasonable turnaround times. However, in  the event of a much-increased workload the CSC  would of course require additional members. In- terested parties are encouraged to contact the  CSC Chair.   o There are situations where Bernalillo County has  Codes and Ordinances that are more restrictive  than the SHHA Covenants. The CSC met with BC  Zoning officials this past year. The intent was to  more fully understand their enforcement pro- cesses, and also to enhance our communica- tions and interactions with them. We feel both  BC Zoning and CSC now have a better under- standing of each other's roles and responsibili- ties, and that we have established workable  communications channels.
