Continued on pg. 2      From the Parks & Safety Committee:  You Asked, We Answered    At SHHA’s Annual Meeting on February 9, 2019, a member asked about  access to recreational trails from the arroyos within Sandia Heights.  The Parks & Safety Committee researched this question in order to pro- vide accurate information to you, our members. The arroyos within Sandia  Heights are on homeowners’ lots. Thus, those who wish to reach trails by  hiking through the arroyos in Sandia Heights are trespassing on private  property. Unless explicit permission is granted by each homeowner whose  lot includes a portion of the arroyo, SHHA advises that hikers refrain from  encroachment. Instead, seek access from areas designated as public land.    Weed and Fire Season is Approaching  By Emily B. Rudin, Vice President and ACC Member    Our nighttime temperatures might be nippy now, but in just a few weeks  the soils will warm, and with them—weeds. And more weeds. And weeks  of spring winds will spread seeds that create…yes, you guessed it: even  more and more weeds!  The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) receives scores of complaints  about landscaping and yard maintenance, particularly in units comprised  of patio homes. If you own a property with zero lot lines, think about the  obvious importance of curb appeal and the need for attractive frontage  so close to the street and so visible among clustered homes.  CSC members invest time and effort to investigate every complaint  about landscaping. But the very broad language of the SHHA covenants— covering nearly 40 units—in actuality means that the CSC cannot selec- tively interpret and impose landscape maintenance restrictions. In other  words, the general nature of the stipulations in all of the units’ covenants  does not empower the CSC to impose higher standards than what was  written. The CSC, however, strongly encourages residents in the zero-lot- line units to be mindful that the appearance of their yards has a greater  impact on the surrounding neighbors than is the case with larger lots.  Please help your neighborhood, yourselves, and the CSC by controlling  your landscape and weeds throughout the growing season. Don’t wait  until plants are unwieldy, become woody, or constitute fire and/or safety  hazards. Just as we schedule haircuts every so often, let’s keep our prop- erties looking cared for and attractive. In fact, while we’re at it, let’s re- move our dead vegetation too: this is one covenant that applies to all  property-owners.  Good landscape maintenance will help keep our home    Officers   President – Woody Farber  Vice President – Emily Rudin  Secretary – Walter Forman  Treasurer – Cheryl Iverson    Board Members  Stephen Baca  Bob Bower  George Chen  David Crossley  Martin Kirk  Susan McCasland  Craig Newbill  Mike Pierce  Travis Rich  Bob Thomas    Committee Chairs  Bob Bower – Architectural Control Com- mittee (ACC)  Bob Thomas – Covenant Support Commit- tee (CSC)  Susan McCasland – Communications &  Publications (C&P)   TBD – Community Service & Membership  (CS&M)  Cheryl Iverson – Finance Committee (FC)  Emily Rudin – Nominating Committee (NC)   Travis Rich – Parks & Safety Committee  (P&S)      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrator  Jessica Seeley – Administrator    SHHA Office   12760-B San Rafael Avenue NE  (A.K.A.) 2-B San Rafael Avenue NE  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9 am - 4 pm  Closed on federal holidays  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Website: www.sandiahomeowners.org  Emails: sandiaheights@comcast.net   shha@sandiahomeowners.org      April 2019                               Vol. 35 – No. 4  Continued from pg. 1  2   The GRIT – April 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 4  values strong, our streets safer due to fire prevention and clear sightlines for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians,  and Sandia Heights as beautiful as it can be.  As a helpful guide for property owners, these photos provide examples of “do”s and “don’t”s.    DO  Keep soil and gravel raked and inhospitable to weeds.  Prune trees, pull weeds, and trim hedges adjoining  other lots.  Keep curbs tidy and corners cleared and visible.  DON’T  Let weeds go to seed and dead plants convey neglect.  Allow weeds to encroach on your neighbor’s property.    Let weeds occupy driveway cracks, giving your home an  abandoned appearance and perhaps inviting suspicious  activity.  3   The GRIT – April 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 4  A Discussion of Walls and Fences  By Bob Bower, ACC Chair  In my decade of experience with the ACC, I have ob- served interesting trends in our community as the de- mographics change. Our 2,200+ residences were built  starting in the early 1970s. When homes change own- ership, the new owners (usually younger and with  more kids, pets, and cars) often submit applications for  upgrades. Some are substantial, such as additional liv- ing space, garage additions, and landscaping with new  or replacement walls and fences. The ACC also receives  requests for minor changes such as upgraded doors,  windows, roofs, and stucco. These minor upgrades  may be administratively approved in a few days. More  extensive upgrades need more time for review prior to  approval. Reviews examine how the modifications af- fect the architectural harmony of the neighborhood.  Often, the ACC will conduct a neighborhood review to  obtain comments from neighbors. I discussed how  these reviews are done in the February 2019 GRIT.  Some of the most challenging applications to review  are requests for walls and fences and I would like to  describe how the ACC handles these applications.  Our covenants have little to say about walls and  fences, except that wire fencing is not permitted. In  the absence of guidance, the ACC created the ACC De- sign Guideline for Walls and Fences available on the  SHHA website. The idea behind the Guideline is to en- sure that walls and fences blend with their surround- ings and are constructed properly and with durable,  high-quality materials. The Guideline imposes limita- tions on location, height, and size of enclosed areas to  minimize the impact of walls and fences on open  spaces, neighboring residences, and natural vegeta- tion. These limitations are as follows:  1. LOCATION: No wall or fence shall be located on  property lines or within setback areas and shall be lo- cated only in areas immediately adjacent to buildings.  The ACC will recognize footprints of existing walls and  fences if they need to be replaced. The ACC will also  consider justifiable requests for variances regarding  placement of walls and fences relative to property  lines and setbacks.  2. HEIGHT: A wall or fence shall not exceed six feet  except when adjacent to gates or other entry points. If  your lot is higher than your neighbor’s, the wall may ex- ceed six feet on your neighbor’s side. That’s accepta- ble, but the ACC reserves the right to disapprove such  a wall if it is deemed to be intrusive or obstructs your  neighbor’s views.  3. ENCLOSURE: Where walls and fences create an  enclosure, the area enclosed shall be adjacent to the  residence and/or or other buildings. The residence and  buildings shall serve as no less than 30% of the perime- ter. As a maximum, the area enclosed shall not exceed  50% of the combined total ground-floor heated living  areas. Swimming pools and garages, heated or not, are  excluded.  4. MATERIALS, COLOR, & DESIGN: All walls and  fences shall be compatible in color and texture with  their surroundings and the residence exterior. The ACC  will not approve walls or fences painted white or a  color that does not blend with the primary residence.  Walls of gray masonry blocks shall be finished with a  stucco coat or other veneer. Masonry blocks are avail- able in attractive colors that do not require stucco or  paint. The ACC encourages you to consult our refer- ence guide of acceptable colors in the SHHA office. Let  the ACC approve the color of paint, stucco, or block  that you want to use prior to constructing your wall.  When there is a difference in the appearance of the  two sides of a wall or fence, the more attractive side  shall face the outside. This is not an issue with masonry  blocks, but it is with fences, particularly wooden  fences, which have horizontal members that support  the vertical members. The “smooth” portion of the  fence should always face outward.  Lastly, no wire fencing shall be installed on any resi- dential property, including for garden areas and pet en- closures such as dog runs. The Guideline defines “wire”  as chain link, barbed wire, chicken wire, hardware  cloth, expanded metal, or materials that have indus- trial and institutional connotations or that lack durabil- ity. The ACC has approved fencing consisting of steel  cables stretched horizontally between supporting  posts and hollow metal fencing similar to that used to  enclose swimming pools. These types of fences are at- tractive alternatives to wood fences. If you have ques- tions about metal fencing, please contact the ACC prior  to installing it.  5. RETAINING WALLS: Retaining walls to place or  protect a house, outbuildings, or swimming pools or to  provide driveways and walkways are permitted and ex- empt from setback restrictions in the Guideline. Please  apply for installing retaining walls.  I hope this discussion of walls and fences helps you  understand how the ACC handles these requests.  Please contact the ACC if you have any questions about  your proposed wall or fence prior to starting the pro- ject.  4   The GRIT – April 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 4  FEBRUARY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Simms Park enjoy many activities below the backdrop of  the Sandia Mountains, which were named for their pink  colors at sunset—“sandia” is Spanish for “water- melon.”  The 640-acre park is a gem in the Open Space system.  At an elevation of about 6,500 feet, visitors can view Mt.  Taylor to the west, the Jemez Mountains to the north  and the vast Tijeras Arroyo to the south.  The landscape supports a piñon-juniper habitat that  includes chamisa, Apache plume, scrub oak, cane cholla  cactus, blue grama grass, bear grass, and soapweed  yucca. Pack rat nests can be seen under juniper trees;  coyote, deer and bear scat can be identified along the  trail; and the elusive cougar may be spotted traveling  through a natural drainage.  Seven covered picnic areas and two reservation areas  with barbecue grills provide magnificent views to the  east and the west. A network of multi-use trails offers  challenges to hikers, bikers and equestrians. Hikers also  enjoy two trails for foot traffic only and access to the  Sandia Mountain Wilderness area. On the north bound- ary of the picnic area is the Cottonwood Springs Trail, a  self-guiding trail accessible to all people, leading to a  pond and wildlife blind. A special feature of the Cotton- wood Springs Trail is the shaded rest stops with original  art work by Margie O'Brien interpreting the surrounding  environment.  School programs and family-based activities are of- fered throughout the year. Visit the Elena Gallegos Infor- mation Center, located at the entrance to the park, to  learn more about the natural and cultural environment  of this area.  Summer hours (starting April 1): 7 AM–9 PM.  Fee:  Monday–Friday: $1 per vehicle  Saturday–Sunday: $2 per vehicle  An Open Space Annual Pass is $30 and can be used by up  to 2 vehicles (1 at a time) at any Albuquerque open space  area. Passes can be obtained at the Elena Gallegos en- trance booth.              8   The GRIT – April 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 4     ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  2 Juniper Hill Loop – Restucco  35 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  302 Spring Creek Place – Landscaping   523 Black Bear Loop – Reroof & Restucco  601 Cedar Hill Road – Restucco   668 Black Hawk Drive – Replace Driveway  727-3 Cedar Hill Lane – Reroof   736 Tramway Lane – Apply Tar & Chip Seal to Driveway  795-O Tramway Lane – Reroof   803 Tramway Lane – Roof Repair  985 Lynx Loop – Replace Windows and Doors  1021 Tramway Lane – Replace Driveway  1128 Marigold Drive – Reroof   1133 Marigold Drive – Pergola Installation  1198 Bobcat Blvd. – Reroof   1524 Eagle Ridge Drive – Reroof  1565Eagle Ridge Court – Replace/Paint Trim and Re- move Retaining Wall  1697 Quail Run Court – Reroof, Replace Canales and  Skylights  1699 Quail Run Court – Replace Office Patio Door  1838 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Windows  1871 San Bernardino Avenue – Roof Repair   1911 Quail Run Drive – Replace Windows  1915 Quail Run Drive – Remodel and Addition   2146 Black Willow Drive – Replace Walkway and Install  Edging Across Driveway  2301 Calle de Rafael – Roof Repair  2878 Brushwood Street – Replace HVAC and Water  Heater  8204 Indigo Court – Reroof and Skylight Replacement   8212 Indigo Court – Refinish Trim  12613 Colony Place – Reroof  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.   New Peak Restaurant Update  By Susan McCasland, C&P Chair, from information  provided by Sandia Heights Services    The High Finance Restaurant at the top of the tram  was torn to the ground a couple of years ago. In its  place, there is a new restaurant nearing completion  and scheduled to open this May. We don’t know what  it will be called, as the name has not yet been released.  The new restaurant has over 11,000 square feet on  two levels. Fine dining will be in the west area of the  restaurant facing the city. More casual bistro-style din- ing will be in the Sky Bar looking east over the ski area.  The building is closer to the edge of the cliff to create  more expansive views than one got from High Fi- nance. Other features are a show kitchen, sky bar,  wine room, fireplace, and private deck seating.  Access has also been improved. There are upper- level restrooms to serve the dining and bar areas and  restrooms on the bottom level for other mountain us- ers (skiers, hikers, mountain bikers, …). All restrooms  are wheelchair accessible.   Let’s welcome one of our closest restaurants (as  the crow flies!)—truly on the heights of Sandia.        9 The GRIT - April 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 4 10 The GRIT - April 2019 - Volume 35 - No. 4 11   The GRIT – April 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 4  Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
