  Neighbors United Against Crime (Part 2)    As we reported in the “Neighbors United Against Crime” article in the June GRIT,  BCSO’s Capt Broderick Sharp and Lt Vance Lunsford began a Neighborhood Watch or- ganizing meeting with a summary of crime statistics for the Sandia Heights area and  followed up with several strategies and safeguards to help reduce burglaries.  The key strategies discussed were:  • One of the most important defenses is for residents to know their neighbors, their  cars, their kids’ cars, and to take note of suspicious vehicles, individuals or activity.  • Captain Sharp warned that residents should avoid confronting suspicious individu- als, but should promptly report observations to BCSO first, then to Sandia Heights  Security (SHS).  • Ask trusted neighbors to keep an eye on your home when you are traveling and  your house will be unoccupied.  • Never leave your garage door open and unattended; this is one of the most com- mon elements in residential burglary in our neighborhood.  • Do not cancel your newspaper when out of town. You don’t know who then knows  you’ll be gone. But do have someone pick up your newspapers.  • Never leave any valuables in your car!  • Security measures, in order of effectiveness, include wrought iron for doors and/or  windows; security system/alarm, especially with cameras; a dog in the home; and  motion-activated outdoor lights.  • For video security systems, Lt Lundsford recommended getting the highest resolu- tion and infrared/night-vision system that you can afford for images to be of most  use to BCSO investigators.  • A large safe or one bolted to the floor is unlikely to be targeted as the typical bur- glary is done quickly, with thieves grabbing what they can in a hurry.  Captain Sharp further indicated criminals target our area because of the expecta- tion they will find valuable possessions. Most home burglaries occur during daylight  hours. Work crews (e.g., roofing, stucco, or landscaping) could include unscrupulous  laborers who are “casing” your home or the neighborhood for future burglaries. BCSO  reported that thieves will follow UPS or other delivery trucks to grab packages.   Captain Sharp said BCSO & SHS cooperate well. The Sheriff’s Office sometimes re- quests SHS assistance with alarms and other calls in our neighborhood; however, resi- dent participation in SHS is not compulsory. Some residents thought if membership in  SHS was mandatory, the funding would allow for more effective security. If it were  mandatory for all homeowners to pay for SHS, it would only be a $13.00 a month fee.  (Note: Sandia Heights Homeowners Association and Sandia Heights Security are sepa- rate entities.)   Capt Sharp and Lt Lunsford urged attendees to report all suspicious vehicles, indi- viduals, or activity to BCSO first with follow-up to SHS as appropriate. NextDoor is  useful to find out about crime in the neighborhood, but BCSO should be notified first  and foremost. Reports to BCSO should be made to 911 (for emergencies), or (505) 798- 7000 (non-emergencies). Darrell Dady, Neighborhood Coordination Specialist, can be  reached at (505) 468-7364 regarding questions about Neighborhood Watch.

First and foremost, the safety of our residents is vi- tal during your construction activities. Most of our  streets are narrow and frequently have curves and hills  which limit driver visibility. Do not allow your contrac- tors to create on-street traffic problems by parking too  many vehicles on the sides of our roads.  2. Please limit all noisy work to between 8 AM and 6  PM, Monday through Saturday and try not to schedule  exterior work on Sundays. If your project involves sig- nificant amounts of site preparation and excavation,  please consider not performing these activities on holi- days and weekends.  3. Control your construction debris by using appropri- ate trash containers or dumpsters so our local winds  don’t scatter the trash beyond the borders of your prop- erty. Make sure the containers are periodically emptied  and are not placed on the street.  4. Caution your contractors that Sandia Heights is  classified as a Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) which  means that it is a high-risk wildfire area containing nat- ural fuels where homes are built. Make sure that your  contractors provide receptacles for the safe disposal of  smoking materials and that they follow simple fire-safe  practices.  5. Don’t allow your contractors to dump used con- crete, stucco swill, or other construction materials  down street gutters, into storm drains, or in AMAFCA  easements or County-controlled properties such as wa- ter diversion channels. If this happens, you may get  stuck with expensive cleanup costs.  6. Ask your contractors to limit the use of radios and  boom boxes that create excessive amplified noise at  the construction site.  7. Make sure that your contractors maintain proper  sanitary facilities on site for use by workers at all times.  Remember to stay involved with your construction  project. If you see issues such as those listed above,  take action to correct any situation that you feel might  create a safety issue for our community or be an annoy- ance to your neighbors.  Reminders from Your Covenant Support  Committee  By Bob Thomas, CSC Chair    Weeds and RVs  The summer is the time for weeds to grow on your lawn  and RVs, trailers, campers, etc. to grow in your drive- way. From handling complaints from your neighbors, it  is apparent that a lot of folks are unaware that they  agreed to abide by covenants when they rented or  bought their homes. If you are not sure what your cov- enants say, stop by the SHHA office for a copy or look  them up on the SHHA website.  This brings us to weeds (especially if you have peb- bles in your front yard). It seems like weeds grow by  inches overnight. If you don’t keep up with them, they  get overwhelming. If you’d treat them like eating an el- ephant (a little at a time) you wouldn’t have to resort to  an herbicide or letting your property go to seed. Again,  it’s a good neighbor thing—keeping property values up.    Enforcement of Covenants  Many times we get complaints involving annoyances,  safety issues, or nuisances. Sometimes these involve en- forcement of county codes or ordinances (e.g., barking  dogs, traffic, parking on the street, non-floodlight light- ing, etc.). When you file these complaints, we do inves- tigate them, but you may get a letter instructing you to  contact the county for enforcement. The CSC does not  have authority or ability to handle many of these issues.  Please understand that SHHA is not a property man- agement organization. It is staffed by volunteers (other  than our hard-working office staff) and we have very  few people that want to help us and work on commit- tees. So, it takes some time for the CSC to do investiga- tions and resolve issues. The 37 different sets of cove- nants, one for each Unit, are far from perfect; however,  only Unit owners can change them.  Speaking of the office staff—when you come to the  office, we know that sometimes you may be frustrated  and may want something done about your problem and  want it done now. Please, don’t take your frustrations  out on the staff. Try to be respectful; they are there to  be helpful and not to be abused.    3   The GRIT – July 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 7  The Goats of Sandia Heights  By Judy Durzo     Goats and sheep have been used to manage vegetation  for over 100 years in the US. Thanks to their voracious  appetites and ability to navigate difficult terrain, they  are used across the West to reduce the threat of wildfire  where wildlands interface with urban communities, like  Sandia Heights. In January of this year, the SHHA paid for  a pilot project to assess the efficacy of using goats to  help reduce the fuel load in our community. More than  60 goats and a few sheep of several breeds—because  the different breeds have different culinary prefer- ences—grazed on a portion of the Domingo Baca Ar- royo on the east side of Bobcat. As this is written five  months later, you can still see the reduction in fire fuels  by looking east where the goats grazed and west where  they didn’t. See the photos, also.  Sheep and goat grazing is a proven, cost effective, en- vironmentally friendly way to clear combustible vegeta- tion, control noxious weeds and promote native grass  and plant growth. Further, grazing improves wildlife  habitat by “pruning” and strengthening vegetation and  increasing plant diversity that supports wildlife. And  grazing preserves roots systems critical to erosion con- trol. Moreover, it is relatively inexpensive, efficient and  requires no trips to the land fill!  A common criticism is that what the goats eat will just  grow back. This is true. But any kind of remediation,  even removal of all vegetation, needs to be revisited in  future years. The Ventura County, CA, fire department  uses goats. They write, “[Fuel] is removed before fire  season and doesn’t grow back until the following sea- son—and it’s much safer to have goats graze difficult  terrain.” Carson City, NV, used goats to clear a fuel break  between wildlands and homes: the goats ate 73% of  forage, reduced ground litter 60% and vegetation height  by 75%. Fire experts estimated this can slow fire travel  speed by about 75% and lower flame heights about 66%.  The City determined that goats could graze for 15 years  for the price of just one home saved from destruction by  wildfire. Quite a bargain! And goat grazing is not new in  New Mexico. Santa Fe’s El Dorado community and the  cities of Taos and Las Cruces have used goatscaping. The  Rio Grande Conservancy District used goats to reduce  the risk of another major Bosque fire, and they plan to  do so again.  Sandia Heights’ most sensitive and vulnerable areas  are the arroyos, described as potential “rivers of fire” by  Bernalillo County and Albuquerque Fire Departments  and WildFire Network. These fire fighters estimate that  such areas can burn as fast as one acre per second…dif- ficult to fathom and frightening to contemplate. Yet,  these areas are also periodic waterways highly suscepti- ble to erosion, so mechanical removal of vegetation by  the roots is not advisable. AMAFCA, which holds ease- ments in our larger arroyos, approves of goat grazing.  In addition to assessing the effectiveness of fuel re- duction, goals of the SHHA goat grazing test were to in- crease community awareness of our vulnerability to  wildfire and to spark homeowner involvement in making  SH a wildfire-savvy community. And it’s working—many  of our neighbors have hired goats to clear land, many  others have been doing hand clearing, and a group of  concerned neighbors is seeking FireWise* Neighbor- hood certification for about 520 homes in seven units.  Inspired by the Sandia Heights pilot project, our neigh- bor High Desert is launching a goat grazing project.   * For more information on local FireWise programs, please see  http://www.wildfirenetwork.org/index.php/projects/2019-sandia-heights or  https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Wildfire/Firewise-USA  or contact the author at her phone number listed in the SHHA Directory.

Baca, CS&M Chair    At this year’s Annual Meeting, your SHHA Board of Di- rectors again heard the request to conduct an annual  satisfaction survey and to publish results in The GRIT.  The CS&M Committee has prepared that 2019 Survey  and invites each of you to respond to the survey and  help all of us continue to make Sandia Heights the per- fect place to live!   The link to the survey is https://www.survey- monkey.com/r/shha-2019 and the survey will be availa- ble throughout the month of July. Last year we heard  from over 700 residents which made the survey statis- tically significant. This year with your participation, we  hope to hear from even more of you!  Your responses can be entered in less than 10  minutes. And, if you are reading this article in print  form, here is the QR Code to get you to the survey.        In advance, thank you for your help and for your in- sights.    It’s Summer and Snakes Are Out  Susan McCasland, C&PC Chair    The rains allowed plant growth, which feeds rodents.  Snakes are next up in the food chain, so we will proba- bly have more than usual this summer. The most com- mon snakes in our area are bull snakes, red racers and  rattlesnakes. Rattlesnakes are the only poisonous  snakes, common or rare, in central and northern NM.  They can be identified, of course, by the rattles at the  ends of their tails. Bull snakes will shake their tails like  a rattler to try and fool you into thinking they’re a big,  bad snake, but there is nothing to rattle and bull snakes  are quite harmless—unless you’re a mouse!  The New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Cen- ter has useful tips for snakebite prevention and first aid  at  https://nmpoisoncenter.unm.edu/education/pub- ed/upload_files/docs/venom_snakes_broc.pdf  No Fireworks in Sandia Heights—EVER!  Parks and Safety Committee    The Fourth of July is upon us, giving some people an  irresistible urge to set off fireworks. BUT DON’T. Even  though there has been ample rain, as the fire near High  Desert shows (see Insert p. 1), our neighborhoods are  quite flammable. Developments such as Sandia  Heights are classified as “Wildland-Urban Interface”  (WUI). In areas with the WUI designation, fireworks  are NEVER allowed! This includes sparklers, bottle rock- ets, mortars, skyrockets, Roman candles, cherry  bombs, and anything else that shoots flames or sparks  into the air. Please do celebrate our Independence  Day—but not with fireworks. Leave that to the pros  with permits.                  7   The GRIT – July 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 7    Woof! Woof! Is that YOUR dog barking?  Covenant Support Committee    Do you leave your dog outside alone? There are many  dogs in Sandia Heights who bark for hours when their  owners are away. Noise carries up the mountain, espe- cially the noise of dogs with loud barks. Consider your  neighbors when you leave your dog out alone for hours  at a time. Their barking can be disturbing to those who  work at home, may be ill, or don’t wish to listen to bark- ing dogs while they are relaxing at home. Most im- portantly…it is against the law to allow your dogs to  constantly bark! According to the Bernalillo County or- dinance, “It is unlawful for a person to allow an animal  to persistently or continuously bark, howl or make  noise common to their species or otherwise disturb the  peace and quiet of inhabitants of the county.” [Ord.  §6.47(a)]  If you are bothered by a barking dog, please first let  its owners know that the dog is barking. They may not  be aware, especially if the barking happens only when  they are away. If that doesn’t work, lodge a complaint  with Bernalillo County Animal Care at 468-PETS.           A Review of How the Architectural Con- trol Committee (ACC) Works  By Bob Bower, ACC Chair    If you are planning a home improvement project that  will alter the external appearance of your home, you  are required to submit an application to the ACC.  Please note that even if you plan on replacing items  such as stucco or roofing using existing materials and  colors, the ACC still needs to review the application for  these types of “in-kind” changes. That said, the initial  step in planning your project should be to review and  understand your unit covenants. You need to be aware  of your property setback distances and of any other  features specified in your covenants that can affect  your project. The ACC also has design guidelines to as- sist you with your planning efforts. These guidelines  are available on the SHHA website.  When you have done your homework, go ahead and  submit your application. You can select a contractor ei- ther before or after the ACC approves your application.  The ACC processes about 300 applications each year.  Many of these involve routine requests for re-roofing,  re-stuccoing, window and/or door replacements, heat- ing and air conditioning system upgrades, minor land- scaping efforts, etc. These projects can usually be ad- ministratively approved within a few days. More com- plex projects, such as room or garage additions and ex- tensive landscaping, may need more time to process.  The ACC will assign a member to work with you on  these types of projects. The ACC may also elect to  gather relevant comments from your neighbors con- cerning possible impacts on their property that could  result from your project. On these more complex pro- jects, the ACC strongly advises you to take advantage  of an ACC review of the project at the early (prelimi- nary) design stage before you commit to a final design.  You may find out that some aspects of your design may  not be approved by the ACC and it is best to find this  out at the beginning of the design process instead of  when the design is more mature. I discussed the sub- ject of preliminary and final designs in the June 2019  GRIT.  One way you can really help the ACC to understand  your project, particularly if it involves major construc- tion, is to submit a plot plan or survey that shows the  location of your home and of the proposed project rel- ative to your property lines. The property survey that  you received with your property deed will usually be  sufficient for this purpose.  The ACC will work hard to expedite your application,  but needs adequate time to do its job of reviewing your  project. Remember that starting a project before you  receive the ACC’s approval is a violation of your cove- nants. With a little bit of advance planning, you can  avoid this issue. Once approved, you have a year to  start the project and a year from the start date to com- plete it. If you need an extension to complete the pro- ject, notify the ACC via email or in writing. Come talk to  us if you need our advice on any of your projects.      8   The GRIT – July 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 7  ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  19 Juniper Hill Loop – Remove Solar Panels and Reroof  32 Sandia Heights Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  33 Juniper Hill Road – Install Collector Boxes and Down  Spouts   66 Pinon Hill Place – Garage Extension  67 Pinon Hill Place – Replace Window Glass in Several  Windows  103 Juniper Hill Road – Restucco   185 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Reroof, Stucco Repair and Repaint  Trim  236 Spring Creek Court – Swamp Cooler Replacement  357 Juniper Hill Road – Remove/Replace Existing Deck  447 Live Oak Loop – Replace Deck  502 Black Bear Loop – Reroof   606 Cedar Hill Road - Reroof  676 Black Hawk Drive – Replace Wood on Existing Pergola  711-19 Tramway Lane – Replace Garage Door  727-12 Tramway Lane – Extend Patio and Install Pergola  793-J Tramway Lane – Paint Garage Door and Trim  793-O Tramway Lane – Replace Wood Lattice with  Alumawood  803 Tramway Lane – Replace AC Unit  808 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  830-A Live Oak Road – Replace Fence with Block Wall  840 Live Oak Road A, B, & C – Replace Windows and Sliding  Door  847 Llave Lane – Restucco   875 Tramway Lane – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  880 Tramway Lane Court – Enclose Carport and Install  Garage Door  885 Tramway Lane Court – Reroof   928 Tramway Lane – Restucco  991 Lynx Loop – Replace Skylights & Repair Existing Roof and  Stucco  1027 Tramway Lane – Restucco   1038 Tramway Lane – Reroof   1055 Red Oaks Loop – Restucco and Paint Trim  1114 San Rafael Ave. – Stucco Repair  1199 Bobcat Blvd. – Landscaping and Repaint House, Trim &  Garage  1210 Marigold Drive – Roof-Mounted PV Panel Installation  1442 Honeysuckle Drive – Roof-Mounted PV Panel Installation  1458 Bluebell Drive – Replace A/C Unit  1501 Eagle Ridge Road – Restucco and Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  1602 Quailwood Drive – Reroof   1605 Quailwood Drive – Reroof   2412 Tramway Terrace Ct. – Replace Existing Wood Fence  2421 Tramway Terrace Ct. – Remove, Replace and Extend  Stucco Wall  2719 Tramway Circle – Restucco   12612 Carmel Court – Replace 3 Patio Doors  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to  see all projects currently under ACC management.
