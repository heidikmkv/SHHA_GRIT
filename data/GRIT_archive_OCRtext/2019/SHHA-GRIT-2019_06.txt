  (Photo by Hans Johnson)          Update on W. L. Jackson Park  By Emily Rudin, Parks & Safety Committee member    At SHHA’s Annual Meeting this past February, a member asked about  whether some family-friendly improvements could be made to W.L.  Jackson Park. (The park is located at the southeast corner of Tramway  Boulevard and Cedar Hill Road NE.)  Specifically, the member asked about:  •  More shade, including an additional structure  •  More picnic tables  •  A splash pad  In the intervening weeks, I have been in consultation with the man- agement of Bernalillo County’s Parks and Recreation Department,  which administers the park. We have discussed the feasibility of each of  the member’s suggestions. Here are the outcomes:  •  More shade trees will be planted in the park.  •  An additional shade structure and picnic table(s) entail a longer  process of evaluation and procurement. But the Department will  review the available budget for these elements relative to  County-wide proposed improvements, and will add them to the  list for consideration.  •  A splash pad would be too expensive to construct, along with the  ongoing costs of maintenance and insurance.  In summary, I’m pleased to let you know that most items on the mem- ber’s wish list are now on the County’s radar, and that we can look for- ward to enjoying added amenities at W.L. Jackson Park.

Rich, Parks & Safety Committee Chair    Following are highlights extracted from the comments  of Capt Broderick Sharpe of Bernalillo County Sherriff’s  Office and Lt Ramon Sanchez of Albuquerque Police De- partment during the March Fire Risk Management Sem- inar hosted by SHHA.  Procedures officials will employ in case of evacua- tion:  • Go door-to-door  • Make phone calls to residents  • If evacuation of the area becomes necessary, law  officials can and will ask you to vacate. In situa- tions where the homeowners refuse, they do so  at their own risk. In the case of a fast-moving wild- fire, the officials may not be able to return for  your rescue.  Each household was advised to create a pre-fire  planned list of what needs to be taken should an evacu- ation occur:  • The list should include medications, basic hygiene  needs, perhaps a meal, water, a blanket, and a  change of clothing in case evacuation extends  into multiple days. The presenters emphasized  what the conditions of life in a shelter might be.  Bernalillo County Emergency Communication gave  these directions:  • To report an existing fire—call 911.  • To report a non-emergency—call 798-7000  • Alerts will be made directly to cell phones (similar  to Amber Alerts) and relayed to AM radio fre- quency 670 kHz. There are no FM emergency ra- dio channels.  • Upon calling, provide your name, location ad- dress, and the name of the agency you are at- tempting to reach (such as Bernalillo County Fire  & Rescue or Albuquerque Fire & Rescue. Sandia  Heights is in Bernalillo County).

But what  caught my attention was the contractor’s well-main- tained, heavy truck with no company name on the door  but they had their NM & TX DOT Numbers. With the  warm weather they are back—Travelers. I am a com- mercial contractor and we always avoid them.  They are called Travelers because they work far from  home and keep moving. They stop long enough to take  in money before the local authorities catch up and then  they move on to the next community. They quote one  price and charge another. Their workmanship is poor  and the materials used are even worse.  A few pointers on what to look for:  • They sell door to door. That includes residences  and business. Legitimate businesses do not knock  on doors looking for work with their construction  crew in tow.  • They claim to have left-over asphalt and are will- ing to make a great deal. Rarely do legitimate pav- ing companies have left-over asphalt since they  have a short time to obtain and place the asphalt.  • They make their “great offer” and make it clear  the offer is good for right now. They don’t want  you to have time for second thoughts.  • They provide great verbal assurances and agree- ments. They don’t provide detailed written  quotes or written agreements.  • They will take cash or checks—no credit-card  sales where you have time to revisit the invoice or  dispute charges.  • Their deal is too good to be true. That great price  for a driveway seal coat turns out to be just oil or  tack coat.  • They usually have trucks and equipment that do  not have business names, local addresses, or tel- ephone numbers.  The first step in getting an asphalt driveway or park- ing lot that will last years is by using a reputable local  paving contactor.      3   The GRIT – June 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 6  2019 Easter Egg Hunt  By Paula Baxter and Walter Forman,   CS&M Committee members    Teresa Cordova and Max Sanchez, partnered with The  Community Services & Membership (CS&M) Commit- tee, held an Easter Egg Hunt on Saturday, April 20,  1:00 to 3:00 PM, at W.L. Jackson Park. The celebration  was a BIG success—largely due to Teresa and Max’s  phenomenal organizational skills and total financial  support; they planned the celebration and timeline  and paid for advertisements, supplies, prizes and  food!  The Easter Egg Hunt was very well attended with  more than 100 children participating. The children  were divided into age-appropriate groups for the egg  hunts and games: less than 5 years old, between 6 and  10 years old, and over 10 years old. Activities for the  children included egg hunts with Easter eggs filled  with candy and prizes, face painting, pictures with the  Easter Bunny, and games such as egg-on-spoon and  gunny sack races. Lots of prizes were awarded to the  children and over 200 hotdogs were enjoyed by all.  Many people expressed their appreciation and several  folks sent e-mail messages of appreciation as well.  The Easter Egg Hunt was a fun way to bring people  together, instill a sense of community pride, and  strengthen family relationships within the Sandia  Heights Community. The celebration was re-estab- lished due to information from the 2018 Sandia  Heights survey and the 2019 Annual HOA meeting  breakout session suggestions related to better serv- ing families with children and grand-children.  The CS&M Committee is grateful and thankful for  the support and participation of Teresa Cordova and  her family. Many thanks to all of the volunteers for  their valuable time and energy: Max Sanchez, Andy  Cordova, Odile De La Beaujardiere, Beverly Forman,  Cheryl Iverson, Travis Rich, Emily Rudin, Bob Thomas,  and Bill Anderson.                            4   The GRIT – June 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 6  APRIL CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Attendees  were able to become better acquainted with their neighbors,  learn more about crime in Sandia Heights, and learn  measures they can take to reduce their exposure to crime.  The BCSO representatives reviewed several crime statis- tics, which showed that Sandia Heights crime rate is signifi- cantly lower than nearby neighborhoods. Darrell Dady re- viewed the Neighborhood Watch Program and outlined the  steps that would occur as a result of the interest expressed  at the meeting, the first one being an area survey of the Units  expressing interest.    The survey by the County resulted in approval of Units 19  and 20 for the Neighborhood Watch Program, and the signs  have been installed by the county. The county paid for one of  the signs, and the other one was purchased for Unit 20. The  SHHA Board subsequently voted to reimburse the cost of the  sign for Unit 20.  Any resident wishing to learn more about the Neighbor- hood Watch Program can contact Darrell Dady at (505) 468- 7364 to obtain answers to their questions. If a Unit is ap- proved for the program, SHHA will pay for the cost of the  sign not covered by Bernalillo County.    Preliminary and Final Design and   Construction Plans  Bob Bower, Architectural Control Committee Chair    I would like to encourage all property owners to review de- sign plans with the ACC for projects involving new construc- tion or major additions to existing residences prior to getting  too far into the design process. The best way to accomplish  this is to set up an appointment with the ACC through the  SHHA office at 797-7793 once you feel that your designs are  mature enough to have a meaningful review with the ACC. A  thorough review of plans at the preliminary stage can iden- tify any problems with covenant restrictions or with any of  the ACC Design Guidelines applicable to the project. This  “early” review will make it easier to correct compliance prob- lems before incurring further costs as you proceed towards  preparation of final (and much more expensive) plans. The  preliminary plans should contain the project’s floor plans, el- evations, and the location of the proposed structure on the  property lot. If exterior materials, colors, lighting, etc. are  also known, go ahead and include these items. During the re- view, the ACC will point out what can and cannot be ap- proved based on completeness of the plans and will go  through a checklist of items you should be thinking about as  you proceed. You should also let the ACC know if you are go- ing to request a variance to the property setback distances in  order to accommodate your project. When the ACC has com- pleted its review of your preliminary plans, you will be en- couraged to submit additional information to address inade- quacies with the plans in order to avoid the risk of later dis- approval of all or part of the project.  Once the ACC gives its written approval of the preliminary  plans, you can then proceed with preparing the final plans.  When the final plans are complete, you will need to submit  an ACC application requesting approval of the project along  with one copy of the drawing set in large format and one dig- ital (electronic) copy. SHHA will archive the electronic copy.  With respect to the drawings, the ACC needs only those that  show the overall floor plan, the elevations of the proposed  structure, the location of the project on the lot and any other  features that affect the external appearance of the resi- dence. Drawings showing internal features (electrical wiring,  mechanical details, etc.) are not required. Once the ACC ap- proves the final design and construction plans, you must  keep the ACC fully informed if changes are made to the ap- proved drawing set.  Bottom Line: keep the ACC in the loop from the very be- ginning when planning and executing your design and con- struction efforts. The ACC has lots of expertise and will strive  to make your experience with the execution of your project  as problem-free as possible.  Elm Trees  Covenant Support Committee  If you have a Siberian elm growing  in the County right-of-way and/or  utility easement of your property,  call the County at 848-1503. They  will remove the tree and treat it to  prevent regrowth. (The County re- quires the homeowner to make the  request directly to them, rather  than by way of the SHHA, to be sure  that the homeowner wants the tree  removed.)  8   The GRIT – June 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 6    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  7 Juniper Hill Road – Replace Asphalt Driveway  32 Juniper Hill Loop – Replace Swamp Cooler with A/C  Unit  67 Juniper Hill Loop – New Construction   108 Whitetail Drive – Coat Roof with Tan Silicone  148 Whitetail Road – Restucco   154 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof and Restucco  250 Spring Creek Place – Restucco  250 Spring Creek Place – Deck Replacement  373 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace a Window and Add  a Window to the Master Bathroom  434 Live Oak Loop – Install Windows and Doors  446 Live Oak Loop – Construction of a Detached  Workshop/Studio  447 Live Oak Loop – Landscaping   452 Live Oak Lane – Reroof, Restucco and Door Eave  Installation  520 Black Bear Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  534 Black Bear Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  662 Roadrunner Lane – Install Hot Tub  725-9 Tramway Lane – Reroof   727-1 Tramway Lane – Reroof   793-H Tramway Lane – Replace Screen Around A/C Unit  and Paint Window Trim  803 Tramway Lane – Install Entry Gate  54 Deer Drive – Install Photovoltaic Panels to Existing  Rack  991 Lynx Loop – Concrete Overlay  1002 Tramway Lane – Repaint Trim and Front Door  1016 Tramway Lane – Reroof   1023 Tramway Lane – Reroof   1065 Tramway Lane – Miscellaneous Projects  1167 Laurel Loop – Replace Existing Wood Fence  1462 Bluebell Drive – Replace Front Doors  1478 Morning Glory Road – Replace Glass Panels and  Glass Doors  1483 Morning Glory Road – Landscaping   1501 Eagle Ridge Road – Reroof   1948 Quail Run Loop – Coat Roof with Tan Silicone  2006 Quail Run Drive – Landscaping & Extend Back Wall  2318 Calle de Gabriel – Paint Pergola  2403 Tramway Terrace Ct. – Restucco  2431 Tramway Terrace Court – Paint Stucco and Front  Gate  2434 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Wooden Fence  2436 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Garage Door  2878 Brushwood Street – Replace Fence with Block  Wall  7712 Cedar Canyon Place – Replace Gate  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.
