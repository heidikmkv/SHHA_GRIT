    Holiday Parking & Lighting Safety Tips  by Bob Thomas, CSC Chairman    The holidays are here! Some neighbors like to put up outdoor lighting, blow  up snowmen, Santa and his elves, nativity scenes, etc. This could be  you…or you may live nearby. If the latter, please be understanding as “all  things shall pass.” If the former, be considerate of your neighbors and turn  off the lights at an early hour, unplug Frosty’s blower, and keep the holiday  music indoors.  Here are a few tips to avoid fires and accidents with Christmas lights:     Check your light sets for cracked insulation, frayed wires or damaged sock- ets. Any of these could cause short circuits.       Don’t overload your string sets. Check the instructions on the package to  find out how many light sets can be connected to each other.       Avoid overloading circuits. Most home circuits can take 15 amps or 1,800  watts.       Cover each outdoor plug and connector joint with plastic wrap to protect  it from rain and seal it with electrical tape.       If you use staples instead of tape to secure lights, be sure that they’re in- sulated staples and that you don’t pierce the wiring insulation.       Make sure decorations pose no danger to children or pets. Don’t leave  cords dangling or strung loosely on the floor or stairs.       Consider using solar-powered outdoor light strings. Most of the fire haz- ards are avoided with these and they’re inexpensive and easier to install.      If you’re having a holiday party, please think ahead about guest parking.  Ask your guests to not park in your neighbors’ drives or on their property  and to not block the road; neighbors and emergency vehicles may need to  pass. Consider inviting your neighbors to the party! And please ,as the host,  be responsible should a guest who drove drink too much—except your  neighbors who can walk home! Have fun and be considerate of neighbors.

The Sandia Heights Board of Directors and Exec- utive Committee have accepted this initiative. With this  initiative, members of the CS&M Committee will person- ally visit the approximately 240 new Sandia Heights res- idents each year. A pair of volunteers from the commit- tee will distribute a welcome package, which will include  a list of SHHA member benefits, lists of local restaurants  and activities, and local trail and bicycle maps. A  housewarming gift in the form of a gift certificate (ap- proximate value $10) to a local Sandia Heights busi- ness—to be provided by the CS&M Committee—will  also be presented to the new residents. By introducing  these businesses to our new neighbors, the gift certifi- cate will help support our local businesses. Lastly, the  pair of volunteers will answer any questions the new  neighbors may have regarding Sandia Heights, the  SHHA, and the surrounding area. We anticipate this pro- gram will start in the new year. If you would like to vol- unteer for this Welcoming Initiative, please contact the  CS&M Committee.                              How to Form a Neighborhood Watch    Neighborhood Watch groups are formed in association  with Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office. This program will  help you and your neighbors organize to reduce crime  in your neighborhood.  How does a neighborhood watch organization form?  The following information is from Bernalillo County  Neighborhood Coordination Specialist, Darrell Dady.     You or a neighbor decide to host an initial Neighbor- hood Watch meeting.   The meeting’s host calls the Neighborhood Coordina- tion Specialist at 468-7364 to provide his or her name,  address and phone number to receive a “starter  packet” that will include, among other items, a form to  collect demographic information from your neighbors.   Collect names, addresses and phone numbers on the  form.   The host then sends the completed list back to the  Neighborhood Coordination Specialist.   The Neighborhood Coordination Specialist contacts  the host to set up a date and time for the meeting and  then mails out invitations to each name on the list.   The Sheriff’s Department deputy will assist with con- ducting the meeting and provide community resource  information for all attendees. To qualify for sign place- ment, 50% of the homes on the block must be repre- sented at the Neighborhood Watch meeting.    The block is now organized and may collectively pur- chase Neighborhoods Organized Against Crime  (NOAC) street signs. The first sign is free, but subse- quent signage will be paid for by your Neighborhood  Watch group.    Several Sandia Heights areas have already organized  into Neighborhood Watches. To start, call Darrell Dady  at 468-7364 or email to ddady@bernco.gov.      An Event to Remember  (mark your calendars now!)

Sponsored by Sandia Heights Homeowners Association    3   The GRIT – December 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 12  Beep! Beep!  By Jean Heflin  [Historical article reprinted from August 1990 GRIT.  Photos added.]    Some of our neighbors are really a kick! Top of the list is  that rackety friend, the roadrunner who makes noises  like a rusty gate or, at other times, sounds as if the cat  has been stepped on (I understand he thinks he’s croon- ing a love song when he does that). He not only makes  insulting noises but is absolutely without any sensibility  about anyone’s (or dog’s) privacy and considers that all  houses and yards are part of his personal estate.  He behaves as if he thinks he is God’s most enchant- ing creature, in spite of the fact that he moves very  much like the animated cartoon that was based on  him…like a wheeled toy that has not been oiled for  years. He does have that bright red spot behind his eye  and a blue one in front of it, a handsome crest that he  can raise or lower when he chooses, a few blue-black or  greenish feathers and a bit of bright blue on his scales  which he may think is dashing but perhaps is a bit dé- classé compared to some other birds.  He is one of the few creatures that the dog will trou- ble to run off the lawn, but he only moves some com- fortable distance to calmly watch the idiot dog make a  fuss. He appears completely fearless. His favorite perch  is on top of the chimney where he can denounce the ac- tivities of the rest of the world. We are lucky that we still  have open land around where he can continue to chase  the insects and lizards that he feeds on and close  enough so we can observe his activities. He approves of  the water we put out but those who have pools should  watch out for him. He can’t swim and has been known  to drown in shallow water. He can fly a bit and can sail  great distances if he gains a bit of height but prefers to  rummage around the ground most of the time.  The West is full of wonderful tales about this odd  member of the cuckoo family; about his ability to catch  and swallow snakes, even rattlers; about his lack of fear  of men and preference for regular habits as well as his  group hunting activities. A friend tells me about a doctor  she knew who had a roadrunner friend that waited reg- ularly at 4:30 when the doctor came home (he must  have been a dermatologist!!) to be fed a chunk of ham- burger, after which he went on his way until the same  time the next afternoon when he showed up for his  treat.  One morning we watched through the glasses what  appeared to be three or four roadrunners attacking  something in the grass, perhaps a snake. They were ob- viously acting in concert. First one would jump up, then  pounce, and then another would repeat the perfor- mance. This went on for several minutes. We never  found out what they were attacking, but they were all  in on the act. There are stories of roadrunners using cac- tus pads to attack rattlers and even building fences of  colla [sic] spines around them so that the snakes ex- hausted themselves as they tried to strike out of the cac- tus corral. Quite unbelievable but affirmed many times!  Anyone who would like a more detailed account of  this cuckoo (in several senses) bird should read Virginia  Douglas’ little book, Road-Runner, put out by Na- turegraph. He’s a neighbor to be watched.      [ed. Anyone who thinks dinosaurs went extinct needs only to look  in the eyes of a roadrunner.]          4   The GRIT – December 2019 – Volume 35 – No. 12  OCTOBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

The 2020 Census Is Coming  By Susan McCasland, Comm & Pubs Chair    Our U.S. Constitution calls for an “actual enumeration”  of the population once a decade. The 2020 numbers will  shape how tax dollars are shared in states, the number  of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for  each state. Local communities will see an estimated  $880 billion/year distributed for schools, roads and  other public services. So, it is important—and required  by law—to be counted.  This will be the first census to allow households to re- spond online or over the phone to a 1-800 number. As in  years past, paper forms will be available. If you don’t re- spond by early April, you may have a visit from a census  taker who will record your responses in person.  This is also the first census since the rise of social me- dia. The government expects to need to combat disin- formation campaigns that may try to disrupt the count.  Don’t be taken in—if you see a post that looks fishy,  such as that certain regional or ethnic groups don’t  need to respond, it probably is disinformation.  Criminals who want to steal your identity will also be  out in force. Here are a couple of ways to identify the  scammers and phishers:  • You get an unsolicited email purporting to be from  the Census Bureau. The real Bureau will contact you  by postal mail, not by email.   • A census agent asks you for money or financial data  or threatens you with arrest. Taking part in the Cen- sus is required by law and you can be fined, but not  imprisoned. No real agent will ask for money or bank- account, social-security, or credit-card numbers.  DOs  • Do verify that a census taker who comes to your  home is legitimate. They should have a Census Bu- reau photo ID badge (with a Department of Com- merce watermark and an expiration date) and a copy  of the letter the bureau sent you.   • Do check that a census mailing has a return address  of Jeffersonville, Indiana, the site of the National Pro- cessing Center. If it’s from somewhere else, it’s not  from the Census Bureau.  • Do check the URL of any supposed Census website.  Make sure it has a census.gov domain and is en- crypted—look for https:// or a lock symbol in the  browser window.  DON’Ts  • Don’t give your Social Security number, mother’s  maiden name, or bank or credit card numbers to  someone claiming to be from the Census Bureau.  Genuine Census representatives will not ask for this  information.  • Don’t reply, click links or open attachments in a sus- picious census email. Forward the message to  ois.fraud.reporting@census.gov.  • Don’t trust caller ID—scammers use “spoofing”  tools to make it appear they’re calling from a real  Census Bureau number. Call the National Processing  Center, 800-523-3205, 800-642-0469 or 800-877-8339  (TDD/TTY), to verify that a phone survey is legitimate.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We meet on the second Saturday of every other month, starting in  September, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6-8 people, including the hosts.  We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the menu  theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal – along with a wine to go with their  dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2  whole group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group  was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are  welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.  Northeast Church of Christ: 11000 Paseo Del Norte, Albuquerque, NM 87122, 797-3025.
