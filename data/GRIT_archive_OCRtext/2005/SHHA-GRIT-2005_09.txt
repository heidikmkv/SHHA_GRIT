  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                           September 2005          JAZZ UNDER THE STARS        The Membership and Community Services Committee will be  sponsoring its second Jazz Under the Starts event.  Please join us for  music and margaritas on Sat Sept 17, 7-9 PM.  Resident Rick  Fairbanks will be bringing his jazz quartet along with vocalist Pam  Jackson.  Ms. Jackson received the 2004 NM Music Award for best  jazz vocalist.      This event will be at the SHHA office courtyard on San Rafael.   Please call Chairperson Vicki Criel at 615-3333 or email her at  vcriel@comcast.net if you have card tables, chairs, lights or candles  the committee can borrow for the evening.  Please contact her if you can help set up or serve  refreshments.  Appetizers and chips are greatly appreciated. Please join resident Dr. John  Milewski, who will be sharing his telescopes that evening.  Jupiter and Mars will look lovely as  you swoon to tunes!      W. L. Jackson Park   - Bob Christman       The park is well used as more people have been hearing about the features provided. We hear  many comments from visitors on the great addition to the neighborhood.  The area surrounding the artwork (Lizards and benches) has been cleared to be more  accessible. At the present time woodchips have been spread in the area. We do not know the  final decision on what surface will be used.  The County has expressed its gratitude on how those using the park have kept it clean. As a  thank you to the neighborhood, they have added another "doggie station" to provide plastic bags  for owners to clean up after their dogs.  A frequent comment that SHHA receives from park users is: there are too many weeds in  general and the County should remove them. The county specification, when the park was built,  required the contractor to spray hydro mulch on all areas that were left dirt from all the grading.  This hydro mulch contained about 12 types of wildflowers and native grass. All of this has been  growing as required since last October per the plan. This is to prevent erosion on the graded dirt  areas. Native grass will take over with time, and some flowers will reseed.  At the present time, there is a large number of purple aster in many areas. Some people have  mistaken this for tumbleweed and have called the office asking about removal. There is almost  no tumbleweed in the park, and any that does blow down to Tramway Blvd will be cleaned up by  the County.  Enjoy the park.    The Little GRIT     Page 2  TRAFFIC & SAFETY  COMMITTEE  - Mark Boslough    Reckless Driving in Sandia Heights  Sandia Heights residents were  endangered on Sunday afternoon, August  14, 2005, by an unknown person who drove  a dark blue off-road motorcycle (no visible  license plate) at extremely high speed up  and down Bobcat, Tramway Lane, and other  nearby streets.  One witness estimated that  the motorcycle was traveling at least 45 mph  and maybe as much as 55 mph north on  Bobcat before turning east on Tramway  Lane at about 4:10 pm. The person in  question appears to be a male between 15  and 17 years of age, light colored short hair,  and of medium to thin build about 5'6" to  5'8" tall.  There is reason to believe that he  either resides on Bobcat, or has friends who  do. At the time of the incident, several  schoolchildren were riding bicycles on a  nearby street.  This could have been a  disaster.  The Bernalillo County Sheriff's office  indicates that patrols in the Sandia Heights  area will be stepped up in an attempt to  catch this individual in the act of reckless  driving.  If you observe this violent and out- of-control person or anyone else engaging in  reckless behavior on our streets, please call  the Bernalillo County Sheriff on their non- emergency number at 798-7000. If you feel  that someone is in imminent danger, do not  hesitate to call 911.    Speed humps installed on Tramway Lane  Bernalillo County has installed speed  humps at the request of residents of  Tramway Lane between San Bernardino and  Bobcat.  This neighborhood had experienced  a serious safety problem over the years,  associated with extreme speeding, high  pedestrian traffic, school bus stops, and poor  visibility. Residents had been waiting since  their first petition in 1998.  The SHHA office has received a few  inquiries from residents of other streets  regarding the process.   Callers wanted to  know why speed humps were installed, why  they were not contacted, and why SHHA  encouraged the County to install them.  The speed humps were installed because  the homeowners on that part of Tramway  Lane requested them from the County.   Their street met Bernalillo County’s criteria  for traffic volume and degree of speeding.   Tramway Lane homeowners submitted a  petition in which their support for speed  humps met or exceeded a 3-to-1 ratio, as  required by the County.  Residents of other streets were not  personally contacted by the petitioners or by  the County, because the County’s process  does not require that step. There is also no  requirement for petitioners to tell SHHA of  their effort to have speed humps installed in  their neighborhood.  When we do learn of  petition efforts, we try to provide the service  of keeping other neighborhoods informed.   Several articles have appeared in the Grit  informing the community of the Tramway  Lane speed hump petition.  The SHHA supported the Tramway  Lane speed hump installation because it has  been our longstanding policy to support our  residents in their dealings with the County.    It is not our policy to try to interfere with  established processes, or to tell residents  what they may or may not do to enhance the  safety of their own streets.  The best way for residents who object to  traffic calming on streets other than their  own is to drive the speed limit everywhere  within Sandia Heights, and to work directly  with residents of the streets they use for  transportation when safety problems arise.  The Little GRIT     Page 4  COMMUNITY AND MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE  - Vicky Criel      LIGHTS IN THE HEIGHTS     It may seem early to be advertising our holiday events, but Sandia Heights residents have  a great opportunity to enjoy wholesale prices if they order early!  The Membership and  Community Services Committee will be sponsoring luminaria and hot chocolate nights on the  Saturdays in December.  If you would like to order luminaria so you can participate, please refer  to the order form on page 7.  The committee will also be providing a list of handy people who  would be willing to help install the luminaria.  Show your pride in the community!     TEENAGE VOLUNTEERS NEEDED     Chairperson Vicki Criel is proud to announce that a number of middle school, high  school, and college kids have approached her about helping with the SHHA events.  This is  fantastic!  The Membership and Community Services Committee is inviting any interested  people to meet at Vicki Criel's home on Mon Sept 12, 6:00 PM for a pizza and pool (indoors)  party.  Address:  1155 Laurel Loop, off San Rafael.  Come just to meet kids in your  neighborhood!    MEET THE SANDIA HEIGHTS CORK AND FORK  As part of our ongoing program to bring more “fun” activities, the Membership and  Community Services Committee has organized a home-based dining activity called the Sandia  Heights Cork and Fork.  Members will meet for dinner in groups of four couples, every second  month, in individual homes.  The kickoff event will be a cocktail party at the home of Larry and  Kit Anderson on September 24.  There is still room for a few more couples, so if you’re  interested, call Larry Anderson as soon as possible at 821-3158.      WET CRIME  - Ed Whitten    Several weeks ago the SHHA office received a call from a concerned resident regarding a  van with a large water tank trailer taking water from one of Sandia Heights fire hydrants. The  resident had recently seen a special on TV channel 4 regarding “water stealing” and was  suspicious of the activity being witnessed. Several photographs were taken and submitted to our  office. In the photographs, the van was clearly identified via the logo on the side (not evidence of  a smart thief) as that of a local service company. The company was contacted and questioned on  the activity. The company owner said they had permission from the city of Albuquerque to take  water from the hydrants using a meter provided by the city. They then pay the city monthly for  the water they use. Unfortunately the water they were taking was that of Sandia Heights, not the  city. In addition, it was clear from the photo that no meter was connected to the hydrant. The  Sandia Peak Utilities (SPU) was contacted and followed up on the issue. SPU indeed determined  that water was being taken illegally. The company was fined plus charged for the water.   The resident was thanked by both the SHHA and SPU for the responsible action and we  would like to thank them again. All of us are paying for these kinds of activities and it behooves  us all to be observant and report activities that we feel are out of line.    The Little GRIT    Page 6  COVENANT SUPPORT  COMMITTEE  - Tom Coyne    PLEASE, NO MORE ANONYMOUS  LETTERS     The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) of  the SHHA consists of volunteers, many of  whom have constraints on the time they  have available to resolve covenant  violations. To assist the CSC in its  resolution efforts certain guidelines have  been established which include:     A. The CSC will not respond to any  complaints received via anonymous  letters, signed letters, phone or e-mail  messages if the complainant is not  willing to file a complaint using the form  available from our web site or the SHHA  office.   B.  The complainant must be a member of  the SHHA. The Association can not  pursue violations, to the point of legal  action if necessary, in support of a  resident who does not participate in  SHHA Membership.  C.  Experience has shown that resolution of  covenant violation problems is more  effective when the involved parties have  discussed the problem prior to  submitting a complaint. The CSC  normally respects valid reasons given by  a complainant for not having made the  effort to resolve the situation.  When a  CSC member is assigned a complaint,  personal contact with the alleged  violator is the first step toward  resolution.    The CSC requests your cooperation.    The Sandia Heights “Hum” – by Ralph  Rudolph  I am a retired R&D scientist in  electronics and physics. I spend a reasonable  amount of time walking about Sandia  Heights. One “hum” source is electrical  supply boxes located on most properties.  Many of these have a distinctive 60 cycle  (plus harmonics) hum caused by loose  transformer laminations, a common  problem. I will also note that stucco houses  are excellent at reflecting sound. When I’m  outside and hear noises, I sometimes think  they are coming from one direction and find  that what I was hearing was reflected sound  originating from an entirely different  direction. My opinion of the “hum” is that it  is primarily from swamp coolers, air  conditioners, supply boxes plus some  roadway (Tramway) noise just reflecting  about and blending. There’s no need to  invoke anything esoteric such as microwave  towers or vertical sync pulses (which cannot  radiate from coax cable). Load your Ipod  with some good music and the hum will be  gone.       ArtsView – By Ralph Rudolph  Last October, ArtsView drew as many as  55 visitors to some artists’ homes to view  their work. This year, some artists had as  many as 150 visitors (!), so the interest has  grown strongly. On comment sheets, most  visitors gave rave reviews. We truly have  some superb artists living here, talented  enough to give any art gallery a feeling of  insecurity.   We had scheduled another ArtsView for  mid-October and already had several artists  who expressed an interest in participating.  However, scheduling problems (my wife  will be traveling extensively to promote her  novels) have prevented this from happening  and I apologize for any inconvenience. If  you have any suggestions for improvements,  please call me at 828-3938 or e-mail  Rudy11@comcast.net.     The Little GRIT    Page 7  Holiday Lights in the Heights    The fifty annual Lights in the Heights is getting under way. This project celebrates the holiday  season in Sandia Heights with electric luminaria. Electric luminaria sets that you see elsewhere  at the retail price of $20/set or more will be available to SH residents at the wholesale price of  $13.25/set (plus tax for a total of #\$13.96/set).    There are ten luminaria in a set, covering thirty feet. Made in New Mexico, they have plastic  uniframes, all-weather plastic bags, and 7-watt candle-shaped bulbs. They come with instructions  and diagrams. We will also include a few hints, about attaching them to stucco, since that is not  always obvious. Do you have a hint that you’d be willing to share? Send it to us and we’ll  include it.    Sandia Heights resident Kit Anderson has volunteered again to head this project. She will  purchase electric luminaria sets through her company, Anderson Organizing Systems, passing  along the wholesale price to SH residents (making no profit, adding only the required tax). Her  husband Larry will compile the information on attaching and displaying the luminaria. The  Andersons and other volunteers will pick up the pre-ordered and pre-paid luminaria sets and  have them available for pick-up at their home, 150 Whitetail Road, from 9:00am to 1:00pm on  two Saturdays, November 26th and December 3rd.    Questions? Call Kit at 856-3667.    To order electric luminaria at the wholesale price, clip and mail to Anderson Organizing  Systems, 150 Whitetail Road, NE, Albuquerque 87122-1921.
