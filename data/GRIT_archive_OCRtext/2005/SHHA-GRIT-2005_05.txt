  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                      May 2005        SHHA ANNUAL MEETING  Church of the Good Shepherd on Tennyson, 10 AM – 1 PM, June 4th 2005    Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and various refreshments will be available.  There’s a lot going on lately in Sandia Heights, from the possible development of the Mhoon  property at Paseo del Norte and Tramway, the ice rink expansion, to the issue of speed humps.  Come and make your input known. Business to be conducted includes:  • Introduction of new officers elected by the Board.  • Presentations by the SHHA Committee Chairmen and Officers.  • Election of new Board members to replace outgoing Board members.  • Voting on changes to SHHA’s Bylaws. Our bylaws require a minimum of forty members  including a majority of Board Members to enact business.   • Town Hall Meeting for residents to express their concerns.  The Board of SHHA needs to know the concerns of the community. Please plan on  attending and making your input known. Democracy means involvement!      President’s Message by Ralph Rudolph    It’s been a busy year for SHHA and its committees. Several ad hoc committees continue to actively  work on issues relating to commercial development along Tramway and to obtain petitions relating  to blocking such development, such as the Mhoon property at Tramway and Paseo del Norte. A San  Rafael speed hump committee is continuing to work to get additional humps on the upper roads as  well as those currently installed.     Our Traffic & Safety committee, working with the County, has finally gotten the speed humps  installed on lower San Rafael to alleviate the speeding problems, making that part of our community  a bit safer. The Architectural Control Committee is busier than ever, handling a record number of  new homes, landscaping and upgrades in a professional manner.  The Covenant Support Committee,  working with a subcommittee, finally has the proposed Unified Covenants in a form that can soon be  submitted for voting by residents. It is a vast improvement on the sometimes ambiguously worded  original covenants. The new Cedar Hill Park, with input from our Parks & New Development  Committee, is almost complete and is being enjoyed by our residents. The Membership Services  Committee is encouraging active input from our residents and is developing many new activities to  bring us closer as a community. And, our finances are in great shape.     The Board now has committee charters in place plus several new policies and standardized  procedures and is functioning smoothly. Problems with our database and file sharing have been (we  hope) eliminated and office procedures have been streamlined and updated.      The Board, at it’s April meeting, reelected Ralph Rudolph as President, elected Ed Whitten as Vice  President and Glen Cheney as Treasurer for 2005-2006.

The  sign is intended to be directional, marking a  major entrance into the community.  Design proposals must include a detailed  sketch or model of the design as well as a  description of the materials used (rock,  flagstone, metal, etc.) The material selected  can vary but the choice must take into  consideration the harsh exposure to the  elements. We are looking for durability. The  design should also reflect the unique  environmental aspects of the community. We  have extended the time frame for submissions  until the month of JUNE.  Proposals must be  submitted to the Parks and New Development  Committee. If your design is selected, you will  receive a payment of $250.00. The design may  also be used at other locations within Sandia  Heights in the future. For further questions,  please call the SHHA office at 797-7793.    RECORD CROWD AT 11th  ANNUAL SANDIA HEIGHTS  WINE TASTING EVENT  - Vicki Criel  Almost 270 people attended the 11th  annual wine tasting at Bien Mur on Sunday  evening, April 3rd.  Participants were able to  shop at the elegant displays of jewelry, rugs  and pottery (30% discount that evening), sway  to live classical and light jazz (at a decibel  where people could still talk), listen to a world  renowned expert on Indian jewelry  authenticity, listen to Star Woman perform,  and observe a silversmith in action.  Wines were served from all over the  world, and each of the five tables had a  different theme. 30 varieties of wines were  served (compared to 7-9 in past years), along  with fine micro beers.  As with any event of this size, a number of  people were involved behind the scenes. Sue  Caudill, Ralph Rudolph, and Cheryl Iverson  washed goblets prior to the event. 57 platters  of fabulous hors d’oeuvres were delivered by  residents, and served throughout the event by  resident teenagers Robb Foxx, Becca Benson,  Jaime Criel, Marshall Hastings, Tray Iafeta,  Megan Economides, Daniel Criel, and Daniel  Rosales.  Damon Runyan, Bill Johnson, Sue Posler,  Sue Caudill, Mona Lee Shilling, Marsha  Thole, Hanna Sorrells, Lena Martinez, and  Sheraz Saint-Lot handed out goblets,  nametags, gift bags, raffle tickets, and silent  auction items.  Most of these volunteers did  not have a break throughout the evening.  Happily, we already have more volunteers  committed to next year’s wine tasting!  The silent auction was a big success with  many more elegant items this year. Bien Mur  donated a Santa Clara pot, a large Daniel  Smith sand painting, and a carved glass eagle  sculpture. Featured guest silversmith Vernon  Jojola donated one of his breathtaking chains  and pendants. Bill Johnson donated  Albuquerque Little Theater season tickets, a  ceramic bowl, and a Weems poster. Linda  Garretson donated two Petroglyph batiks by  Placitas artist Dorothy Bowman. Kevin  Fleming donated a handmade wooden  ornament. Whole foods donated a shopping  bag full of its trademark 365 food items and a  $25 gift card.  Ralph Rudolph donated  software, his homemade wine, and one of his  own sculpture reliefs. Kit Anderson signed  and donated her book on organization skills  and techniques.  The Mechanic donated a lube  and oil change, and Ben and Helen Collins  donated a gift basket of local salad dressings.  Vicki Criel donated 8 tram tickets. Premier  Limousines donated a limo ride, and Just Fine  Ballooning donated a hot air balloon ride.  The committee wishes to publicly thank  Nancy Mendez and her colleagues from Bien  Mur. They could not have been more  cooperative and generous.  The wine tasting event has outgrown this  venue. The committee plans to hold the 12th  annual wine tasting event at a larger forum  where the tasting tables can be more  accessible. Plane tickets and a cruise are  already reserved for next year’s auction items!  Page 6  New and Returning BOD Member Nominations    The following is a list of BOD candidates for 2005/2006 from the Nominations Committee. Please take  a moment to review the candidate profiles to be ready to vote for new Board Members at the SHHA  annual meeting in June.    Dick Cline, Unit 14:  Mr. Dick Cline is a retired Air Force veteran with experience in building  construction and human resources. He flew many types of military aircraft and after Air Force duty was  with American Airlines. As a Director of a Texas homeowners association he coordinated the updating  and revision of the 15-year-old homeowners regulations.    James S. Irving, Unit 20:  Mr. Irving is a retired attorney, had a 33-year career as an FBI agent and as a  Deputy District Attorney in California. He has been a Sandia Heights resident for 15 years. He served  on the Board of Directors of a Peace Officers Association and was president of the Rio Grande Jazz  Society for two years.    William Wiley, Unit 20:  Mr. Wiley is a Vietnam veteran with many years experience as a financial  advisor. He has served as a volunteer on seven civic association Boards of Directors. He desires to help  enforce the covenants, keep SHHA responsive to members and increase membership, and maintain the  natural environment we all enjoy.    Bill Johnson, Unit 8:  Mr. Johnson is retired from a long career in health care management, including  CEO of UNM Hospital. He currently serves as a Board member of six volunteer organizations. He is  interested in assisting SHHA in the areas of finance and community service & membership.    Ralph Rudolph, Unit 10:  Mr. Rudolph has served the SHHA Board as Vice President and is the  current President. He has served on quite a few other Boards over the years, including that of American  Mensa (8 years). He is a retired senior engineer with considerable experience in project planning and  supervision, which is reflected in his ability to direct the functions of the SHHA Board. He also served  as Chair of the Bylaws Committee, which rewrote our Bylaws in 2003, and on two other committees. He  desires to be reelected to the Board so he can serve the SHHA as President for the coming year, since he  was reelected to that position by the current board.    Because of the deadline to get the Little GRIT to print, there may be some names that are not on this list.  We apologize for any omissions. Orientation meeting for new board members will be held on June 8th at  7pm.    Proposed changes to SHHA Bylaws to be voted on   at Annual Meeting:    Since the new Bylaws were voted on at the June 2003 Annual Meeting, several problems have been  found and the Board has proposed corrections. A full copy of the Bylaws may be found on the Bylaws  link on the BOARD page of our website www.sandiahomeowners.org. Or a copy can be picked up at  our office. Only changes and explanations are shown below:    Section 3.6 Elections of Directors: Add a sentence at the end. “It should be noted that nominations  “from the floor” are not permitted.” Explanation: Section 3.5 spells out how candidates for the Board  are selected. This clarifies that procedure.    Page 7  Proposed changes to SHHA Bylaws to be voted on at Annual Meeting  continued    Section 3.11. Business Transactions: Change “The Board shall establish an agenda…” to “The  President shall establish an agenda…” Explanation: The Board has never established an agenda and has  no means to do so.     Section 3.12 Voting: Change last sentence to read, “A valid proxy vote must be signed and dated no  more than one month in advance by the absent member, must designate how the vote(s) are to be cast,  and must designate the person to whom the proxy vote is assigned. Explanation: This prevents  continuing proxy votes.    Section 3.14 Resignations and Removal of Directors: Second sentence: Change the word “and” to  “or” following “New Mexico Non-Profit Law or these Bylaws…”  Explanation: Corrects a simple oversight.    Section 5.1 Standing Committees: Change the first sentence to read “Standing Committees are those  established in Sections 5.3 to 5.10…” Explanation: This makes room for a new Section 5.2 explained  below.  Change third sentence to read “No officer as defined in Sections 4.4 to 4.7 except for the Treasurer who  automatically heads the Finance Committee and the President who automatically heads the Executive  Committee, may serve as a Chairman of a Standing Committee. Explanation: We forgot to list that the  President heads the Executive Committee.  Change fourth sentence by inserting the word “other” before “Standing Committees. Explanation:  Clarification of how Standing Committees elect Chairmen.  Change sixth sentence to read, “Decisions and actions of all Standing Committees must be reported at  each Board meeting and may be subject to Board review except those of the Architectural Control  Committee.” Explanation: The Covenants do not allow for reviews of ACC decisions.    Section 5.2 Special Status of Architectural Control Committee: This is a new section. “Although the  Architectural Control Committee is herein defined as a Standing Committee of SHHA, it is also a  separate entity deriving its powers from the various Units’ Declaration of Restrictions, dating to the  direct transfer of responsibilities from the prior ACCs. It should be understood that should SHHA (for  unknown reasons) cease to exist, the ACC would continue to exist.” Explanation: Clarifies the dual  nature of ACC.  Renumber Previous Sections 5.2-5.10 to become Sections 5.3 – 5.11.    Section 5.6 Architectural Control Committee: Change to read, “The Architectural Control Committee  shall consist of a minimum of five (5) SHHA members, at least two (2) of whom must be Board  members, excluding ex-officio members. For each Unit in Sandia Heights for which the ACC has  responsibility, it shall perform the duties and functions set forth in the applicable Units’ covenants  relating to the approval or disapproval of plans for new construction and exterior changes to existing  buildings and property as well as other functions set forth in its charter. At least one member of the  ACC, who must be a Board member, shall serve concurrently on the Covenant Support Committee.”  Explanation: The ACC believes it needs members with particular expertise, which is not always  available in Board members. It should be able to select non-Board members who have such expertise.     Section 5.11 Other Committees: Change the first sentence to read, “the Board may appoint other ad  hoc or Standing Committees consisting of Board or non-Board members with a Board member as  liaison, with such powers duties and functions as the Board shall specify…” Explanation: The  requirement that a Board member chair such committees was removed. Our current ad hoc committees  are working just fine with only a liaison.   Page 8    MEMBERSHIP AND COMMUNITY SERVICE COMMITTEE  By Vicki Criel    The newly formed Membership and Community Service Committee met on Wed,  April 6.  Activities were divided primarily into committee-wide events and smaller  special interest groups.  Sub-committees were then formed.  The outdoor fitness and movement sub-committee includes David Barthel, Claudia  Lawrence, and Lori Templeton.  This group will plan Sandia Heights picnics, fitness and  game events.  Two small neighborhood events are planned for the year.  Kit and Larry Anderson,  Kathy Aas, Les Lebo, and Vicki Criel are coordinating a clean-up and grill day and a  holiday neighborhood get-together.  These will be set up in each unit throughout Sandia  Heights.  The committee is hoping to have at least one contact from each unit to help with  these activities.  Note:  Your unit # is typically the first one or two digits of your address.  A welcoming sub-committee was formed to welcome new residents to Sandia  Heights, and to gather gifts and discounts for all SHHA members.  This group includes  Vicki Criel, Claudia Lawrence, Christine Doughty, Linda Garretson, and Joani Granger.   The committee will be listing new residents in the Grit, and coordinating neighborhood  unit welcome coffees.  Again, the committee is hoping to have one person from each unit  to act as that area’s initial contact.  The Music and Speakers sub-committee include Vicki Criel, Jim Irving, Andrea  Carvey, Linda and Kerney Bolton, Les Lebo, Carol Cowan, Bill Johnson, and Linda  Garretson.  A number of Sandia Heights residents have volunteered to show off their  musical talents and to speak on various topics for the community.  Special interest groups and databases are being assigned.  Kit and Larry Anderson  will be coordinating a Sandia Heights Gourmet Club.  Some residents have written  requesting a Book Club, a Playgroup and younger family database, a Car Group, a hiking  group a recycling forum. . If you have an interest in any of these topics, please contact  Vicki Criel at vcriel@comcast.net or 615-3333.  Bill Johnson and Mona Lee Shilling have volunteered to coordinate Sandia Heights  trips and discounts to the Opera, the theater, and the symphony.  Please keep an eye in the  Grit for future events.  The goal of this committee is to increase SHHA membership, increase involvement  and caring in the community, provide opportunities to meet neighbors, and to have fun in  Sandia Heights!  The committee needs many more volunteers willing to take on small  tasks to make these events successful.  Our next planning meeting will be at Sandiago’s,  at the bottom of the tram, on Wed, May 18 at 6:30 PM.  Please contact Vicki Criel,  chairperson, if you have ideas or want to be involved but are unable to attend the next  meeting.  She can be reached at vcriel@comcast.net or 615-3333.  Page 9  THE PERILS OF BEING  TOO SUCCESSFUL    – By Ralph Rudolph, President    Our many past wine tastings were held at  Futures for Children and were always a  success, drawing about 170 residents for a  relaxing and pleasant afternoon chatting  with neighbors. When this year’s wine  tasting was planned, we found that Futures  for Children was not available and we had  to find an alternative venue. Vicki Criel,  our Membership Services Chairman,  selected Bien Mur and both Bob Francis,  our former president, and I visited it. To  our eyes, it looked suitable. And perhaps it  could have been if we did not have the  unexpected “success” of attracting over  300 residents instead of our normal 170.    Bien Mur clearly proved too small to  handle 300 people with any degree of  comfort, and it was plainly difficult to get  to the too few wine tables and food. As a  result, more than a few residents expressed  anger and frustration at money poorly  spent on what we had hoped would be a  gala event. On behalf of SHHA, I offer  our sincere apologies and promise that  this won’t happen again as long as I am  on the Board. It has not helped our  community building efforts to have had  this happen. We will learn from  experience. I sincerely hope that this rare  failure to please will not harm future  attendance at wine tastings, although I  suspect that it may.

This new building is on  Tramway between Paseo and San  Bernardino. My report was based on  conversations with Peter Pineda of  Maestas and Ward Commercial Real  Estate. I was shocked to learn, on March  17, from Exhilda McKinley,  Commissioner Cummins’ assistant, that a  building permit request had been  submitted for a video arcade/café at that  site called “U Got Game Café.” The  drawings called for 20 video games, 2  pool tables and an air hockey table along  with a lunch counter and a few tables.    The County quickly advised them that  such an entertainment complex is not  permitted under the C-1 zoning for that  property. C-1 zoning does permit up to 4  games and that includes pool tables. On  April 13, our committee, along with other  officers of SHHA, met with the owners of  the “U Got Game Café,” Amy and Ron  Camden, and advised them that we would  not support a zoning variance for them to  have a video arcade. They are now  examining their options. I think they  would prefer to get out of their 5-year  lease.    Robert Mhoon, who owns the 10 acres  immediately east of the “T” intersection  where Paseo dead ends onto Tramway  Blvd., presented to the County his  rationale for why he should be permitted  access at that intersection in order to build  a shopping center there. Some of you will  remember that SHHA mounted a  successful effort to oppose that when he  first proposed it five years ago. By letter  dated April 4, 2005 from the County  Manager, Thaddeus Lucero, Mr. Mhoon  was advised that he was mistaken and that  he is not entitled to access at that  intersection.     In 1990, the County elevated Paseo del  Norte to form the “T” intersection with  Tramway and to provide an overpass over  Tennyson. Mr. Mhoon, with other  adjacent property owners, sued the county  for “loss of view, change in grade and loss  of access” to Tramway Blvd. They won  that suit, and in 1991 he was paid over  $200,000. Because he has already been  compensated for this loss of access and  because of the increased traffic volume on  Tramway, the County’s letter states it is  unwilling to support his request.     This committee, along with the Parks  Committee, chaired by Wendy Wells, is  pursuing a strategy to have that land  acquired as “Open Space.” Stay tuned.
