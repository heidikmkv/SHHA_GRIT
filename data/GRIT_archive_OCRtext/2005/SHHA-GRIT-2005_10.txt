Traffic, Safety and Environmental   By Mark Boslough    Roadways and Chamisa     This is the time of year when our chamisa are at their  best.  Also known as rabbit brush, their yellow blossoms  rival the beauty of the colorful aspen of the high country  and the golden cottonwoods of the bosque. Unfortunately,  they have their drawbacks. In addition to smelling like  sweaty gym socks, they block the view along some of our  roadways when they get too bushy.     According to Bernalillo County Ordinance Code Section  66-225(c), adopted in 1988, it is the homeowner's  responsibility to maintain the setback area and all plantings  therein, including chamisa. Nevertheless, the county has  worked with the SHHA on a "courtesy mowing project" to  keep about 3 feet of the roadside clear of shrubbery and  vegetation.     If you don't trust the county to do a good job, now is the  time to make sure that the chamisa along the road adjacent  to your lot is not creating an unsafe obstruction to drivers.   Please trim it back if you don't want the county to mow it.     Because we have lots of roads and limited resources,  please submit requests for county mowing to the SHHA  office and we will prioritize them with the county. Then we  can all enjoy the fragrance of freshly mowed chamisa.    Siberian Elms Aren't Natives.      As their name suggests, these trees (incorrectly called  "Chinese elms" by some) are an invasive species.  According to April Fletcher of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife  Service: Removal presents a major challenge since  incomplete removal will result in sprouting from the cut  stump or root fragments, even small ones. Stumps resprout  as "shrubs" and incomplete root destruction can result in  sprouting of satellite trees which can grow as much as 5 to  10 feet in the first year alone.  (Even removing a stump  may not stop the tree from sprouting from remaining  roots!) Several years ago, Bernalillo County removed elms  from alongside many of our streets. They're b-a-ack (as  saplings)!      We have requested a second visit, starting with San  Bernardino near Little Cloud Park. Please let us know  whether there is an elm problem on your street and we will  prioritize.                                              Continued on page 4  The GRIT                                                                                                                               Page 4  Traffic, Safety and Environmental   By Mark Boslough continued from page 3    Fire Hydrants and School Bus Stops       Chamisa, elms, and other vegetation are  blocking access to fire hydrants and  school bus stops in many of our  neighborhoods, with obvious impacts on  safety.     If you know that there is a fire hydrant  hiding behind the bushes near your house, it  is probably in your family's interest to make  sure that the fire department can find it.   Please cut the brush, or report it to the  SHHA office so we can have the county do  so.     Also, if the neighborhood kids are  standing in the street near your house  waiting for the bus, please make sure there  is a safe place within the public right-of-way  (off the pavement) for them.  The SHHA  and county are more than willing to help  clear a safe waiting area for kids at bus  stops, but problems need to be reported.   And if you are a parent and your kids are  using a bus stop in front of a neighbor's  house, please be sure they don't trample the  landscaping, even if it is within the county  right of way. As always, mutual respect and  neighborliness are called for. We will be  giving priority to fire hydrants and bus stops  in our upcoming requests for county  trimming.    Those who wear the Black Hats  By Ed Whitten    Four months ago when I took over as  President of SHHA, one of my primary  goals was to strengthen community unity.  That task is most certainly not accomplished  overnight and we are still working hard to  accomplish that objective. Our Community  Services and Membership committee,  chaired by Vicki Criel, has conducted  various community events that have  certainly furthered this objective. However,  I am still concerned that relations between  residents and some of our committees are  not what they could be.    The Architectural Control Committee  (ACC) and the Covenant Support  Committee (CSC) seem to be perceived as  the people with the “black hats.” There are  16 individuals, all volunteers, who work  very hard on these two committees to  improve our community. Covenant  compliance is a very important factor to our  property values and neighborhood  appearance. It is not an easy job for these 16  volunteers to enforce our covenants with  consistency and still maintain a positive  appreciation from residents. They are  constantly trying to improve a people- friendly approach and yet remain firm on  covenant issues. Both committees have been  working to adjust their policies and  procedures to insure consistency. However,  they do need your help and understanding to  accomplish this task.    It is also important that everyone be  observant regarding covenant violations and  report them using the established  procedures.  When residents do not live  within the intent and spirit of the covenants,  it affects everyone, and that detracts from  the community that we are trying to  achieve.       We recognize that the procedures may seem  awkward at times, but they are structured to  insure consistency and help these  committees perform their duties efficiently.  Every effort is being made to streamline the  processes without jeopardizing the  objectives.    We welcome your suggestions and  comments.  The GRIT                                                                        Page 7    Crime exists. Your vulnerability should not be ignored.  Threat assessment is a means for you to calmly evaluate your risks.    9 Many burglars will spend more than 60 seconds attempting to break into a home. Make sure  every external door has sturdy, well-installed dead bolt locks.  9 Sliding glass doors offer easy access when not properly secured. You can secure them by  installing commercially available locks or placing a broomstick or wooden dowel in the inside  track to jam the door.  9 Never hide house keys under the door mat or a rock near your door. Most burglars know that  trick. Instead, give your key to a trusted neighbor.  9 All outside doors to your house should be metal or solid wood.  9 Install a peephole in all entry doors so you can see who is outside without opening the door.  9 Don’t use door chains, they break easily and do not keep intruders out.  9 Prune back shrubbery and trees so they do not obscure windows or doors. Plant thorny bushes or  cacti under your windows.  9 Install outdoor floodlights or motion-sensor lights to eliminate any areas where someone might  hide.  9 When you go out of town, give your house the “lived in look,” by setting a few of your lights on  timers. Stop your mail and newspaper delivery or have a trusted neighbor pick it up for you.  IF  YOU ARE A SUBSCRIBER, CALL SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL AND  ADVISE THEM OF YOUR ABSENCE; WE WILL PROVIDE EXTRA PATROL. Ask a  trusted neighbor to keep an eye on your home while you are away.  9 While walking, avoid isolated areas. Walk confidently and with another person if possible. Do  not carry a lot of cash and avoid wearing anything that would attract a lot of attention.  9 When answering the door, never let a stranger in for any reason.  9 Always ask service people for ID before letting them into your house. You may want to contact  their company to verify their identity and employment (an honest person will not mind).  9 Beware of a stranger who approaches you with a “great deal.” If it sounds too good to be true, it  almost always is.  9 Do not leave anything such as ladders or tools lying around that can be used to break into your  house.  9 If you are female and live alone, do not advertise it by putting your “Miss Jane Doe” on your  doorbell or mailbox. Use only your initials for first and last names.   9 Mark all your valuables with your driver’s license number. Videotape the contents of your  home. Keep the video and a list of valuables in a safe place.  9 Never leave your keys in your car. Never leave your car unlocked. Always take your purse with  you.  9 Write down and report to Security or the Sheriff’s Dept. the license number and description of  vehicles you feel are suspicious in your neighborhood.  9 Remove any personal identification from your key ring.  9 Trust your instincts. If a situation or place makes you uncomfortable or uneasy, leave or call  Security.  9 If someone comes to your door asking to use the telephone, make the call yourself. Do not let  them in.   9 If someone in a vehicle asks for directions, answer from a distance. Do not approach the vehicle.

This effort was the result of  preparations for the voting phase for the  proposed Unified Covenants, because these  Unified Covenants will be an amendment to  the original Unit covenants.    The guidelines specifically state that full  responsibility for amending covenants rests  with the property owners. The guidelines  contain suggested steps to initiate an  amendment and to proceed to filing it with the  County Clerk. Samples of the necessary  documentation are included.    The Covenant Review Group will soon be  meeting with our resident volunteer marketing  adviser, Fred Hindel, to develop a definitive  plan for the Residents Outreach phase of  presenting the proposed Unified covenants to  all property owners in Sandia Heights during  the coming months. We are hoping to call for  voting no later than May, 2006.    For the information of the Unit 20 property  owners, the covenants for that Unit were  recently amended with a significant change.  Copies of the amendment are being provided  to each property owner and will be posted on  the SHHA website.

The ACC has entered into discussions with  representatives of Jenco Homes, the  potential developer, and Environmental  Dynamics Inc., their architect, regarding  plans for development of this property.   Their planning is in the early stages of  conceptual design.      The ACC has informed abutters to the  property and solicited their comments.  The  following is a brief description of the  proposed project:     DESCRIPTION: The current concept  includes six “Luxury Patio Homes” on  the eastern half of the property and a  Day Spa to the west, containing 4300  square feet on two floors and parking  for 27 vehicles.  All construction and  landscaping are described as upscale- high-end and designed to be in  harmony with the general area.      Environmental Dynamics has provided a  conceptual plan which is available in the  SHHA Office.  You are encouraged to  review this plan and provide any comments  that you might have. The office is located at  2-B San Rafael NE, in the office building to  the east of the Quail Run Shopping Center,  on the southeast corner of San Rafael and  Tramway Blvd.  Office hours are 9 a.m. to 3  p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding  holidays.     The ACC expects that this project will  evolve over time as the developer receives  inputs from potential home buyers.  The  ACC is encouraged by the very high quality  of the developer’s plans and the spirit of  cooperation they have exhibited with the  ACC and SHHA.  There are a number of  steps, however, that the developer must take  before the ACC can accept its application  for construction approval.      In preparation, the ACC is consulting with  the SHHA’s attorney to assure that all  regulatory issues are well understood.  The  ACC is prepared to assure that the restrictive  covenants for Unit 16 and the zoning  regulations of Bernalillo County are fully  exercised for the benefit of all concerned  and for the benefit of all of Sandia Heights.   If this project moves forward to  construction, the ACC will be working very  hard to see that it becomes an appropriate,  attractive, and valuable addition to our  community.   _______________________________    Is there construction in your neighborhood?

Letter to the Editor  -Alyson Clark & Chuck Wingate    This letter is to say ‘thank you’ to the  members of the Traffic and Safety  committee for getting the speed bumps built  on Tramway Lane. They are well placed and  easily traversed when one drives at the  speed limit. Considering the volume of  pedestrian and pet traffic, this was an  important accomplishment.
