        Presidents Message by Ralph Rudolph    I’m pleased to announce that Tom Coyne has volunteered to be our new Vice President.  And I’d like to thank Bob Francis for his excellent job of temporarily filling the job,  working on tracking lawsuits and on negotiating a new Service Agreement with Sandia  Heights Services.     We have appointed a Nominating Committee of Vicki Criel, Bob Francis and Frank  Soper to find candidates to run for the Board at our Annual Meeting in June. If you are  possibly interested, please contact one of them or the SHHA office. We also decided to  delay voting on our Bylaws changes until the June meeting.     Our new budget has been approved by the Board. Anyone interested can pick up a copy  at the office. Bob Francis conducted a procedural audit of our books and pronounced that  all is well.    Lena has had a great recovery after her operation and has returned to work at the office  earlier than anticipated. We are extremely pleased. Sheraz has completed work on the  Directory and members will be receiving it shortly.     In general, we had a great 2004 and made progress in many areas. We look forward to  doing even more in 2005, with many more exciting Membership Services under Vicki  Criel’s leadership.

As a resident, if you provide a service or product, and you would like to see it promoted,  please contact Vicki Criel, chairperson at vcriel@comcast.net or 615-3333. You do not need to be  member to help with this promotion.    PARKS & NEW DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE  - Wendy Wells     We are seeking design proposals for placing a sign at the entrance of Sandia Heights North on the  NE side of Tramway where it intersects with Juniper Hill Road. Members of that community have  asked us to replace the one that was removed because of disrepair. The sign in intended to be  directional marking a major entrance into the community.     Design proposals must include a detailed sketch or model of the design as well as a description of  the materials used (rock, flagstone, metal, etc. ) The material selected can vary but the choice must  take into consideration the harsh exposure to the elements. We are looking for durability. The design  should also reflect the unique environmental aspects of the community. Proposals must be submitted  to the Parks and New Development Committee by April. If your design is selected, you will receive a  cash payment of $250.00. The design may also be used at other locations within Sandia Heights in  the future. For further questions, please call the SHHA office at 797-7793.    News from Your ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL COMMMITTEE (ACC)    - Kerney Bolton     The ACC needs your help!  Whenever the ACC receives an application for new construction, major  additions and remodels, it calls for a Neighborhood Review.  If you are in the vicinity of the project,  you will receive a letter request to participate.  The ACC needs your participation!       The Neighborhood Review letter will contain a brief description of the project and if, applicable,  any concerns that the ACC might have with it, and whether a variance has been requested or is being  considered.  Please come to the SHHA office to take a look at the drawings and specifications for the  project and use the Comments Sheet that will come with your Neighborhood Review letter to let us  know what you think.  If you and your neighbors have questions, concerns, or would like to discuss  the project with others, the ACC will schedule a Neighborhood Review meeting.  Usually the  meeting will include a presentation of the project, a question and answer and discussion period, and a  site visit.       “The buck stops here.”  The ACC accepts full responsibility for the approval or disapproval of all  applications submitted to it and is committed to enforcing covenant restrictions in a thoughtful and  humane manner that is consistent with the best interests of the homeowners of Sandia Heights.       Most applicants are very concerned and sympathetic to their neighborhood’s opinions and are  willing to respond.  There is a long history of accommodation to neighborhood concerns.   Bear in  mind, however, that not all concerns can be resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.   Homeowners are free to develop their property subject to the restrictions contained in their unit  covenant, which in some cases are not sufficient to address all issues.       The system is not perfect, but when we all work together we can produce some amazing results.

Many of the  Sandia Heights residents enjoyed visiting seven  artists’ homes in the afternoon.  This was a wonderful  community-building event, which is planned to be  repeated on an annual basis. The organizing  committee extends the community’s gratitude to the artists who exhibited their artwork in  this event and welcomed the art lovers in our community to their homes and studios. Visitors  enjoyed the hospitality of the artists and appreciated their eagerness to provide information  about their artwork. The exhibiting artists were: Don DeGasperi, Lynda Burch, Stanley  Schmidt, Linda Manion, Terry Lee Heller, R. Peter Buttner, and Ralph Rudolph.    The 2nd Arts View will be October 16th 2005. The organizing committee is starting to collect  information from the interested artists. Please contact Rudy Rudolph if you are interested in  participating: Address:  1044 Red Oaks Lp. Albuquerque, NM 87122, Phone:  828-3938  Email:  rudy11@comcast.net.              The 1st meeting of 2005 was on  January 19th.  Mr. Jim Sais of  Rowland’s presented “Remedios - Mexican Medicinal Herbs &  Medicinal Plants.” His talk and slide  show included some history of the  original settlers in New Mexico and  their healing methods using native  plants. Mr Sais will be conducting a  series of seminars at Rowland’s, the  first of which is “Pruning Fruit Trees  and Shrubs” at the San Mateo store on  Jan 22nd at 10:00 am, at the Menaul  store on Jan 26th at 10:00 am, and at the Montgomery Store on Jan 29th at 1:30 pm.  February  topics are “Growing Fruit Trees,” “Growing Herbs,” “Vegetable Gardening,” and Growing  Grapes and Berries,” followed by “Pruning And Growing Roses” in March. A complete seminar  schedule is available at any Rowland’s store. Many thanks to Jenison Klinger and William  Dawes for hosting this meeting.      Upcoming Events  Our next meeting will be on March 16th.  The details of the program will be mailed to all members.

When advised by  the office staff that they must file a written complaint  using the established complaint form in order to initiate  an investigation by the Covenant Support Committee,   we do not receive a completed form so no action is   taken and the situation is unresolved.    We ask that in order for CSC to perform its service to   the residents, the complainant follow the procedures,   i.e. a written complaint form which can either be emailed  to www.sandiahomeowners.org or brought to the SHHA  office. The complaint form is available on the above  website.    The CSC wants to sincerely thank each resident who,  during 2004, fully cooperated with the committee to  correct covenant violations upon receiving notice of a  violation. Your cooperative attitude convinces us that  most Sandia Heights residents want to abide by our  covenants and have a concern for the neighbor’s welfare.        Introductions    In addition to being president of SHHA, Ralph   Rudolph is also a contributing artist and Publicity  Director for the Nob Hill Gallery, 3015 Monte Vista.   His wife Penny is a novelist and her latest novel,   “Listen to the Mockingbird” won the international   EPPIE award as one of the best novels of 2002. Her   latest novel, “Thicker than Blood” will be issued by   the prestigious Poisoned Pen Press this June, and they  have optioned a third novel. She would like to meet   other novelists living in Sandia Heights. Call her at   828-3938.

For those of us near Tramway,  this is a huge noise problem. I've called the Bernalillo County Dept. of Communications each  night and eventually they send a police car, with its roof lights flashing, which quickly disperses  the offenders. Sometimes, though, it can take 30 minutes for their arrival.      Sandia Heights Security has no interest in helping out here ... they just tell me that I should  make the calls. "The Sheriff's Department prefers calls from residents." Hogwash, but I won't  argue with them.     I would like to ask SH residents/neighbors that if you hear the noise, please call 768-4160 to  report the drag racing. What I'm hoping is that if there are numerous calls, the patrol car response  time might decrease.   -Ronnie Sklarin    SHHA MEMBER CLASSIFIEDS  These ads are also published on our website (free for SHHA members as space allows)     Excellent Housekeeper:  Has some days  available.

You elected  me to represent your interests and values, but to do that thoughtfully and appropriately, I’ll need  your participation.     The state’s budget is the priority during the session, and currently, nearly half of it goes to K- 12 education. New Mexico is not a wealthy state—that requires using the resources we do have  in a judicious manner.  I believe that charter schools and vouchers hold great promise.  New  Mexico is only about $500 below the national average ($7,557) in per student cost, but we are  rated “F” for preparing our students for college. Is it any wonder we have such a difficult time  drawing high end business when we can’t seem to educate our workforce?  Clearly, we have  some work to do.     Because of expanded eligibility and benefits that often exceed the average commercial  program, Medicaid is the fastest growing program in the state.  It represents about 21 percent of  our budget.  One interesting proposal is a hybrid in which public, private and government entities  share the premiums.  We must find a solution that balances our limited revenues with the  responsibility to take care of our neediest residents,       Water-related issues will be on the table this year and that means vigorous clashes between  competing interests. The combination of agricultural water rights and evaporation from the  Elephant Butte reservoir represents about 85 percent of New Mexico’s water.  That leaves little  for everything else.  Rather than forcing owners of water rights to pour water on the ground to  protect their water rights, we need to seriously consider mechanisms such as “water banking” so  that we can guarantee water for potential business and residential concerns. It makes sense, not  only economically, but also environmentally.     Other proposed legislation that will undoubtedly surface will be DWI, Voter ID, and yes,  Virginia—the cockfighting bill will rise again.  I will personally be sponsoring the Scooby Bill  which will mandate a bittering agent in all anti-freeze sold in the state.  The passage of this bill  will not only protect our children and pets, but it will also put us near the top of a “good” list.       I will also be pushing and strongly supporting an effort to repeal the provision that removed the  veto power from the unincorporated part of Bernalillo County.  As you know, this is what  allowed the city/county unification advocates to ignore our concerns—twice!   At the very least,  let them “sell” it to us on its merits rather than the fact that we have no voting power and could  be disregarded. If the legislature passes this repeal, we will not have to go through yet another  vote in two years.     In addition to my unincorporated part of Bernalillo County, I also represent a portion of  Sandoval County--La Madera, San Pedro Creek and Placitas.  I’ve been extremely impressed by  the Placitas residents who have committed huge amounts of time and energy to better their  community.  Their enthusiasm is contagious and I applaud their efforts.  Edgewood represents  my portion of Santa Fe County, which thanks to forward-thinking leadership, is on its way to a  viable and productive economy.  Here too, I’ve met many people who care deeply about its  future and are willing to walk the walk.     Finally, you can beg and plead, but I don’t intend to support any new tax increases.  Simply  put, we need to do a better job with the revenue we get, not tax more to cover deficiencies in our  system.       I encourage you to come visit me at the Roundhouse (Office 201B), my phone number is (505)  281-9540, but if that’s not possible, my email is Katrina@swcp.com.
