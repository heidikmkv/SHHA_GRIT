  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                    December 2005    President’s Message:   HAPPY HOLIDAYS!    Occasional Legal Necessity   In past numerous articles the importance of enforcing the covenants and maintaining the high  standards of Sandia Heights community has been stressed. Enforcement can sometimes get  complicated and the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) has on a few occasions had  to resort to legal action to ensure protection of our neighborhood. This legal approach has never been  a desired action but, when it is found to be necessary, SHHA has been and will continue to be willing  to devote the appropriate funds to pay for good legal representation. The SHHA will consider  initiation of legal action for enforcement of the covenants, on behalf of a unit’s property owners,  based on the following criteria: severity of the violation, inability to clear up the violation by routine  methods and procedures, and the availability of funds. SHHA would much rather spend its money in  other ways, but the protection of the property values in Sandia Heights is very important to all of us.  It is fortunate and with good reason, that SHHA has been successful on matters of litigation and has  never lost a case. SHHA will continue to enforce the covenants; and, with your help, we will  maintain the high standards of our Sandia Heights community. Encouraging membership in SHHA is  one way to help our community address these issues.    New Wastewater Treatment Ordinance     On November 8, 2005, the Bernalillo County Commission preliminarily approved stricter rules for  wastewater (septic system) treatment.  This was the first reading of the new ordinance.  The public has 30  days in which to respond to the proposed new rules. This action was taken as a result of the State of New  Mexico passing in September 2005 of new laws requiring stricter rules for wastewater and wastewater  treatment.  If your system is functioning properly, you have until January 1, 2015, to comply with the  revised ordinance.  However if you modify or replace your wastewater system, or sell your home, you  must comply with the new ordinance after its acceptance which, if passed, will take effect in January or  February 2006.     Compliance can be achieved in several ways, depending on lot size and bedroom count. Some of the  acceptable solutions range from simple filters to aerator pumps, small processing systems (Nitrate  depletion), or even holding tanks. Some of these solutions can be quite expensive.     SHHA was approached by the Bernalillo County/City of Albuquerque Sewer Authority to consider  running a sewer system to the Sandia Heights homes that are on septic tanks.  This would require  establishment of an assessment district to fund the sewer system. Cost without state or county funding or  both will be very costly.  There are no plans at this time to form an assessment district.     SHHA is working aggressively to learn more about the regulations. The pros and cons of requesting a  variance for Sandia Heights is being investigated with the help of our county commissioner and state  representative. We have established an ad hoc committee, headed by SHHA member Bob Francis, to stay  close to the issue and communicate as much as we can. SHHA is reviewing the proposed ordinance and  will provide input to the county commissioners in the next 30 days.     This issue, like many others, affects all of Sandia Heights. If you are not a member of SHHA we  encourage you to join to help us protect our property values. If you have any questions regarding your  system, you should contact a certified wastewater company, or call the Bernalillo County Office of  Environmental Health at 314-0333.

These  contributions have varied from financial donations (both large and small),  sponsorship of displaced families, onsite volunteer work and even in  communication support by local Amateur Radio operators. Our community  should be proud that it can and does pitch in when the need arises.   – Ed Whitten  The GRIT                                                                                                                            Page 3  COMMUNITY SERVICE &  MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE   -Vicki Criel, Chair     The First Sandia Heights Coffeehouse will  take place on Sat., January 14, 7:30 p.m. at  the Church of the Good Shepherd. The  performers are the internationally renowned  duo Acoustic Eidolon.    This remarkable duo is in town for a concert  January 13 at Windchime on Central Ave.  (downtown) and the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association is extremely  fortunate to be able to present them in a  special concert for Sandia Heights residents  on Saturday, January 14.     Friends and relatives of Sandia Heights  residents are welcome to attend, and we are  also inviting the Church of the Good  Shepherd congregation, but we have  promised not to compete with AMP  Concert's January 13 show  (www.abqmusic.com). Our concert will only  be publicized in the GRIT, the Church of the  Good Shepherd newsletter, and via flyers at  the church and at local businesses.    Hannah and Joe perform music from Bach  to the Beatles on cello and Joe's unique  double-neck guitjo, built exclusively for  him. They have performed at such venues as  the Kennedy Center in DC, St. Paul's  Cathedral in London, and the Spandau  Theatre in Berlin, Germany. Their  recordings have been featured on NPR's "All  Things Considered." They have also  performed in Albuquerque's own "Summer  Nights" series at the BioPark. Read about  them and listen to their music on  www.acousticeidolon.com.     A donation bucket will be at the entrance,  and donations of $15 will be suggested but  not mandatory, and attendees may contribute  what they can afford. Money collected, after  deduction of our  few expenses, will  go to the artists,  who normally  receive a  substantial  performance fee.  Coffee, teas, and desserts will be available.  This will be an alcohol-free event that may  be enjoyed by people of all ages.    We need a few volunteers to help the day of  the show. Please contact Coffeehouse Chair  Linda Bolton at 856-7100 or via email,  nlightsmgt@aol.com. Kerney Bolton, who  has extensive sound experience and a  complete professional sound system, can use  a couple of volunteers with strong backs to  help set up sound. Contact Kerney at 856- 7120 or kernarch@aol.com.    This will be the first of what is hoped to be  many Sandia Heights coffeehouses, taking  advantage of national and international  artists' appearances in Albuquerque.         PARKS AND NEW DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE  - Mark Boslough, Acting Chair    Walking Path Along San Bernardino    We have received a commitment from the  county to contribute matching funds for a  cost-share walking path paving project that  will connect the deadend sidewalk at Little  Cloud Park to Tramway Lane, providing an  important pedestrian access link from our  neighborhoods to the pathway along  Tramway Blvd.  The Board has approved  reserve funding in the 2006 budget to pay  for our share of the project, and actual  allocation will be up for vote at our January  11 meeting.   Funding for this project will  demonstrate to the county that we are  Continued on page 4  The GRIT                                                                                                                            Page 4  Continued from page 3  committed to such improvements, and put us  in a better position to receive Capital  Improvement Project funds for other  improvements in the future.    National Forest Access  The 2006 budget also includes reserve  funding to begin research to acquire an  easement for traditional access (pedestrian,  non-motorized) to the National Forest open  space directly from Sandia Heights.   We  hope to work with a boundary lot owner to  obtain permanent access from the  neighborhoods.     Capital Improvement Project Opportunity  We are seeking volunteers to help write  Capital Improvement Project proposals.  We  have been informed that North Albuquerque  Acres gets most of the money for our region  because their members attend the meetings  and are active in writing proposals.  Sandia  Heights did not participate last time around,  two years ago.  This is your tax money.  If  our San Bernardino walking path project is  successful, we will be in a good position to  get more funding for future projects along  those lines.    School Bus Stop Improvement Competition  The SHHA has allocated $200 to improve a  school bus stop in Sandia Heights so  children can have a safer and more pleasant  wait every morning.  We will be accepting  proposals from SHHA members until  February 1, 2006.  We will award $200  toward improving an existing bus stop.  This  project was inspired by the neighborly park  bench that was installed by a resident on the  corner of Rockrose and San Rafael.    RULES:  *  Projects must be collaborations between  the homeowner closest to the bus stop and  one or more parents of children who use the  stop.  *  Participants must be SHHA members.  *  Submission of a 1-page description of the  project, with a sketch, list of children who  use the stop, and signatures of the  collaborators with addresses and phone  numbers.  CRITERIA:  *  Enhanced safety, neighborhood harmony,  low maintenance requirement, and appeal to  children.  *  Number of children who use the stop  every morning.  The winner will be announced in March,  2006.    Special Liaison Committee   - Don Wortman, Chair    VANDALS HIT “$1.50 CLEANERS”    Early on the morning of Sept. 21 vandals  damaged the “$1.50 Cleaners” to the tune of  $10,000. They went on a rampage, breaking  everything. To the Sheriff’s Deputies  investigating they seemed intent on closing  down this new business. They broke the dry  cleaning machine, scattered the claim tickets  outside and even went so far as to take the  photo of the owners – Beth and Dave  Eisenhower, along with their young son -  and smashing it.     They entered the store through front  windows that face Tramway. By  extraordinary effort by the Eisenhowers, and  the fast help of repair and maintenance  companies, they were back in operation  within 24 hours.      The next night there was an aborted attempt  to break into the Phillip’s 66 station. A panel  of glass was broken and set off the station’s  alarm system. The vandals seemed to have  stopped at that point.   continued on page 7  The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) Needs Your Help!

Some of the businesses have also  upgraded their alarm systems.     There is no question that we are experiencing increasing  vandalism, especially in the last two years. This may be due  to the increased traffic on Tramway. The neighborhood of  Tramway Terrace Court held a meeting on their security  concerns in July with Commissioner Cummins and  representatives of the Sheriff’s office.     Acts of vandalism, along with drag racing on Tramway,  require all of us to be more observant and to report  suspicious activity to the Sheriff’s office promptly. If life  threatening call 911, if not, then call their non-emergency  number, 798-7000.                On 11/04/2005 The Sheriff’s Department conducted a  Tactical Plan to combat drag racers on Tramway Blvd and  surrounding areas. The operation was done between the  hours of 9PM and 2:30AM. 6 Detectives, 2 Patrol Deputies,  1 Sergeant, 1 Lieutenant, and the Sheriff participated in this  Tact-Plan. Deputies were able to make 1 arrest (reckless  driving) and issue several citations for careless driving, no  insurance and drag racing. While issuing citations and  making contacts, warnings were given out: Stay away from  Tramway and stop drag racing or the Sheriff’s Dept. would  take more action. During the course of the night the racing  was minimal, and action was taken for those who were  participating in illegal activities. Unfortunately the Sheriff’s  Dept. does not have the resources and budget to conduct  these tact-plans every weekend. They continue to enforce  traffic laws and conduct operations periodically throughout  the year. If the residents are able to get license plate numbers  and a brief description of what they see. The Sheriff’s office  will do a follow-up and speak with the registered owner  about the event.

NEW ACE IS MORE THAN JUST A  “BIG TOOLBOX”- Unique Helpful Home  Improvement Service Right in the  Neighborhood    Imagine a hardware store where all the supplies  you need to impeccably manicure your lawn and  repaint your family room are all in one place.  The days of wandering from department to  department with aisles packed with unorganized  nuts, bolts, pipes and lights are now over.  Thanks to the new Rio Grande Ace Hardware  opening on 7847 Tramway Blvd, this home  improvement dream is now a reality.      “The design of this store, along with our highly  trained staff, focuses on helping consumers  solve their home improvement problems,” says  Robert R. Coca, Jr, owner. “This environment  not only makes shopping for home improvement  supplies a less daunting and intimidating task for  do-it-yourselfers, but also creates a unique and  helpful shopping experience.”  Signature areas  of the store include Housewares, Giftware, and  soon to come, Outdoor Nursery.  The grand opening activities are planned for the  weekend of December 2-4. (Doors open early at  7am). Festivities will include special sales,  discounts, door prizes every hour, lots of FREE  giveaways, 770 KKOB live remote (Jim  Villanucci), drawings for prizes, free balloons,  face painting, clowns, pictures with Santa, piano  by D’Irvin, Mariachi music, live performance by  Old Man Shattered, and much more all weekend  long.    The store stocks more than 20,000 products and  can readily tap into an additional 65,000  products carried in the Ace distribution center  for the region.     “We’ve designed this store with one key element  in mind – our customers,” said Coca. “We  wanted to provide our customers the ultimate  helpful shopping experience.     For maximum customer convenience, Rio  Grande Ace Hardware is open Monday through  Saturday 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. and Sunday from 9  a.m. to 6 p.m.   Membership & Community Service  Committee  - Vicki Criel    Lights in the Heights       Do not forget to light up your homes with  sparkling lights and luminaries the three  Saturdays in December. Let’s “LIGHT UP  THE HEIGHTS” in Sandia Heights. Please  call Kit Anderson, chairperson at 856-3667 or  Vicki Criel, committee chairperson at 615- 3333 if you need assistance installing lights or  luminaries. They are compiling a list of  volunteers willing to help with this task. If you  would like to be included in that list (volunteer  or perhaps, a teenager wanting to make a few  bucks), please call Kit Anderson or Vicki  Criel with your contact information.     The SHHA Membership and Community  Service Committee will provide hot chocolate,  Dec. 10, 17, and 24. Call Chairperson Vicki  Criel if you would like to host a brief  gathering at your home for your particular unit  on one of these evenings.     The committee has been corresponding with  Santa Claus and is hoping he will be able to  drop in at these gathering locations.  Also, SHHA is encouraging caroling groups to  participate. If you are interested in assisting  with this task, please contact Vicki Criel at  615-3333 or VCRIEL@comast.net.     The goal is to brighten Sandia Heights, but  also, to get out briefly meeting a neighbor.  These gatherings may be cookie exchanges,  hot wassail exchanges, or simply meeting at  one corner in that unit.

We received numerous requests and  in most cases the county performed the  requested action with no complications.          However, due to potential for conflict in  situations where neighbors do not agree on  what should be trimmed, we now ask that  requests go straight to the county. Please call  Bernalillo County Dispatch with your  requests at 828-1503.  On corners where  there is a clear sight-line visibility and safety  concern, the SHHA can help expedite your  requests.    Low Speed Limits Are For a Reason     Sometimes we get queries from residents  who think that our community's speed limits  are too low. There is a reason that most of  our streets are limited to 15 mph.  They are  narrow and curvy, and in many places there  is limited visibility because we value our  vegetation and natural environment more  than we desire the wide and straight  thoroughfares required for rapid transit.   Traffic engineers have driven our streets  with a ball-bank indicator, determining that  many of our curves are unsafe at speeds  greater than 15 mph.       Moreover, our streets are a multi-modal  transportation system. They are used by  joggers, dogwalkers, babystrollers, and  children walking to the bus.  We've even see  an in-line roller-skater running his dog.  Please keep these other users in mind at all  times when you are tempted to drive  faster than the posted limit.          How To Get Speed Humps     The SHHA is dedicated to helping  residents make their streets safer. Several  neighborhoods within our community have  opted for speed humps, and others are  inquiring about how to go about getting  them installed.  The county has a well- defined process that neighborhoods must  follow in order to qualify for these safety  devices.       The SHHA role is to foster  communication and cooperation between  residents and the county, but, contrary to the  understanding of some, we have no control  over the process.  Residents who want  humps on their street must ask the county to  do a site visit and speed survey to determine  whether the speeding, traffic volume, and  street properties (segment length, existence  of sidewalks, etc.) meet the county's criteria.  If it qualifies, then neighborhoods must get  75 percent of the residents of their street  segment to sign a petition.  After the county  confirms the petition signatures, it issues a  work order.  We get occasional complaints  from residents of other neighborhoods, who  felt that their opinions were not considered,  but this is not part of the county's process  and SHHA has had a longstanding policy of  not interfering with local neighborhood  decisions.
