  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                      July 2005        President’s Message by Ed Whitten    I would like to thank all of you who attended the annual meeting  on June 4. We had a good turnout and accomplished several objectives.  Four new directors for the SHHA Board of Directors (BOD) were voted  in. The BOD welcomes Dick Cline, Jim Irving, William Wiley and Bill  Johnson. We look forward to their contributions in the upcoming year.  The recommended changes to the by-laws were voted on and approved. The latest  version of the by-laws is now posted on our website (www.sandiahomeowners.org).   Several board members whose terms expired and those who resigned during the past year  were recognized. The following individuals contributed greatly to our community and the BOD:  Ralph Rudolph, Cheryl Iverson, Wendy Wells, Bob Francis, Larry Greher, Jim Erspamer and  Chuck McLeod.  We thank you.  All of our seven standing committees were very busy this past year and a good summary  of their various activities was presented. Most all of these committees could use more volunteers  to help with their projects. If you or someone you know could contribute, please contact anyone  on the board. There is a particular need for people to help on the Covenants Support Committee  (CSC), the Architectural Control Committee (ACC), Traffic and Safety Committee (T&SC) and  Parks and new Development Committee (P&ND). As you will read in the article by Mark  Boslough, there is a significant need for a special committee to work the pedestrian pathway  project. I would encourage anyone with an interest in this project to volunteer. The resources of  SHHA will be made available for this special committee.  A Town Hall meeting followed the formal BOD meeting. I appreciate those individuals  who spoke out on the various concerns of our SHHA community. We welcome your input  because that is what provides the guidance for the BOD to set its priorities.  The two most  dominate concerns that came from our Town Hall discussions were traffic-calming devices  versus safety on our streets and the potential commercial development East of Paseo Del Norte  and Tramway. The BOD will be working with both of these issues along with several other  neighborhood concerns. We continue to welcome your input.  I look forward to this year and the challenges of bringing our community closer together.

It has been a good year  for our Association.   We’ve made great  strides in  strengthening our  financial situation.    For the past 12 months total receipts were  $184,271 and disbursements were $159,464.   All committees were within budget and this  was accomplished by hard work by our Board  members and with increased support from our  membership. This year we received a 13%  increase on our insurance policies, down from  the 17% increase in 2004.  Our Office Staff  expenses increased by 3%; however, we are  fortunate to have Lena and Sheraz with us.  I’m  certain all of you who have interacted with  them would agree with me.  Our Legal  expenses were up 6% this year.  However, a  legal action was determined to be in our favor  for the majority of the legal costs this year.    Our accounts were audited again this year and  found to be in good standing.      I want to thank everyone for their support these  past 3 years and encourage you all to support  my successor, Glen Cheney, as you have me.   Glen brings a strong business background to  the position and will do an excellent job.    Thank you.

COMMUNICATIONS and PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE  - Glen T. Cheney, SHHA Treasurer     Former Chair, Communications and Publications Committee  After joining the SHHA Board in February 2005, I became  Chair of the Communications and Publications Committee in  March following the resignation of the former Chair, Bob Francis.  Other members of the Committee for the past year have been  Cheryl Iverson, Mona Lee Schilling and Ralph Rudolph. Since I  was elected the SHHA Treasurer in April, I left the post of  Communications and Publications Chair following the Annual  meeting on June 4, 2005 and assumed my new one. Welcome to  the new Communications and Publications Committee Chair, Bill  Johnson.  The Communications and Publications Committee’s major  responsibilities are the publication and distribution of the GRIT,  Little GRIT and the Annual Sandia Heights Resident’s Directory.   The Committee also oversees the SHHA web site and provides  Board members with their Board of Directors Handbook. Sheraz  Saint-Lôt of the SHHA office staff does the heavy lifting of  desktop publishing, selling ads and proofing of copy for our  publications as well as managing printing and distribution. Her  help has been and is invaluable.  In the past year since our June 2004 Annual Association  Meeting, six GRITS, four Little GRITS, the Sandia Heights’  Directory and a Board of Directors Handbook have been published  and distributed.    Total Communications and Publications Committee expenses  for the year ending May 31, 2005 year were $24,707. Advertising  income for the same period was $29,072. Net income was $4,365.    COVENANT SUPPORT COMMITTEE  -  Frank Soper  We want to recognize this past term’s Covenant Support  Committee members for their exceptional service: Victoria Smidt,  Tom Coyne, Jim Erspamer, Tony Salem and Kenneth Hook.  Serving on the CSC is one of the most challenging positions on the  SHHA Board due to our responsibility for correcting covenant  violations that are brought to our attention.  During the past term the CSC received 43 violation  complaints which were properly filed, verified and acted on.  Another group of complaints received via phone calls, emails, and  letters from non-SHHA members, was not pursued. A breakdown  of the complaints received, by violation type, is available on  request from the SHHA office.  Continued on page 6  The Little GRIT    Page 6  COVENANT SUPPORT COMMITTEE  Continued from page 4  Because the violator did not respond to  CSC requests for compliance in three cases it  was necessary to have the SHHA attorney  send notice of legal action to be taken. This  resulted in almost immediate corrective action  by the violator. We want to thank those  residents who cooperated fully with the CSC  to correct their violations.  The proposed Unified Covenants were  approved by majority vote of the Board of  Directors in mid-April and are now posted on  the SHHA website for the information of all  residents. We sincerely appreciated the efforts  of ten homeowners who critiqued a proposed  version of the UCs in February. A number of  their suggestions have been included in the  approved version. We are now preparing for a  meeting with a volunteer resident having a  marketing background to establish our  Resident Outreach program. We hope that a  significant number of residents who expressed  the need for improved covenants will step  forward for this effort. Please contact the  SHHA office if you are willing to be involved  when this phase begins, or if you have  suggestions for us to consider.    Traffic, Safety and Environmental  - Mark Boslough  Volunteers needed to make projects happen  Over the past year, many Sandia Heights  residents have expressed a desire to have a  network of walking paths.  San Rafael Ave.  has been identified as a high-priority location  for such a trail because of the ongoing  speeding problem and associated risk to  pedestrians and other users.  In a recent  survey of San Rafael users, the largest  majority of respondents recommended a  pedestrian pathway as their preferred solution  to the safety problem by providing physical  separation between walkers and automobiles.   Unlike speed humps, this is not something the  county has funding to do, nor is it a project  that residents can simply request by petition.   Advocates of this approach must take the  initiative, or it will not happen.  San Rafael is a collector street that has a  high traffic load (by our semi-rural standards)  for both vehicles and pedestrians.  Over the  years, native plants and landscaping on San  Rafael have grown in the utility easement,  right up to the edge of the street.  We have  received many comments from residents who  would like to see vegetation removed on at  least one side of the road, so that walkers can  avoid conflict with speeding vehicles.  Even a  3-foot wide shoulder would allow pedestrians  a place to get out of the way.  The SHHA Board would like to help  make such a pathway a reality if the residents  of San Rafael desire it.  Volunteers are needed  to develop plans, secure funding, and even to  clear vegetation and help residents re-locate  mailboxes and other improvements that lie  within the easement.  Several years ago we obtained estimates  from the county for walking trails with  various specifications.  The cost estimates  ranged from $32,000 per mile for treated  natural surface, to $92,000 per mile for  colored concrete. This cost would include  grading and surfacing of a 6-foot-wide trail,  which could accommodate most non- motorized users.  Needless to say, these costs are vastly  greater than the Association is able to fund, so  it will be necessary to apply for capital  improvement grants or raise money by some  other means.  We encourage residents and  users of San Rafael to volunteer to form a  committee and work with the SHHA board on  this endeavor.  We believe that the  development of trails should be a grassroots  effort that is supported by both residents and  users of the neighborhoods where trails are  desired.  Such trails would have to balance  aesthetic considerations and desire for  undisturbed natural landscape with the need  for safety and a pedestrian-friendly  neighborhood.   Please contact the SHHA  office if you are interested in creating a  volunteer committee for this purpose.  The Little GRIT    Page 7  Excellent house  cleaner.   References  available.
