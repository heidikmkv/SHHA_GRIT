In each case the SHHA Board of  Directors took a position that they  considered to be in the best interest of all  Sandia Heights residents.  Was your voice heard in these  controversies? Was the view of your Unit  represented on the SHHA Board of  Directors?   Now there is an opportunity for you to  have a voice on the SHHA Board of  Directors. Eight vacancies will be created as  current Board Directors’ terms end in June  2005. We would like to see as many Units  and Districts of Sandia Heights represented  on the Board of Directors.  The next few years will be an exciting  opportunity for you to help plan the future of  our Association. Please review the blue  center section of the 2005 Directory of  Residents, which lists the duties of the  committees and other functions of the  Board.  If you are interested in serving on the  SHHA Board of Directors please call the  SHHA office at 797-7793. If you have any  questions regarding how the SHHA  organization works or what is required to  serve on the SHHA Board of Directors  please don’t hesitate to call the office or  contact any member of the SHHA Board of  Directors.    Publications and Communications  Editor  - Sheraz Saint-Lot  THE 2005 Directory of Residents was  mailed out to all members this past month. If  you did not receive yours please notify the  office.   Some of you have called the office  because your listing was printed incorrectly.  We sincerely apologize for those errors. We  had a problem with our database in 2004 and  although efforts were made to remedy the  computer malfunction the repercussions came  out in the 2005 directory. To avoid this  situation in the next published directory the  office will be sending out a listing to each  resident giving you the opportunity to correct  any of the information before we place it in  the directory.   NOTE:  Please make a correction to the  directory for:   Carol and Randy Holt, 605 Cedar Hill Road,  858-0032    Masterworks of New Mexico  Your participating Sandia Heights  neighbors invite you to view Masterworks of  New Mexico during the month of April 2005  at the Hispanic Arts Building of Expo New  Mexico.

Page 6  RACING ON TRAMWAY  -Don Wortman, Chairman of Special Liaison Committee  If you see or hear auto racing on Tramway you are encouraged to call 798-7000 immediately.  The Lt. William Sibrava Sheriff's Substation near Paseo del Norte and Eubank is aware of the  problem and they are working on it. There has been a marked increase in auto racing especially  on weekend nights. Some attribute this to the crackdown the Albuquerque Police Department has  done on auto racing on Montgomery Avenue.    RETAIL STORES IN NEW BUILDING  -Don Wortman, Chairman of Special Liaison Committee  The retail building between the empty Eckerds building and Albuquerque Kwik Lube is  nearing completion. According to Peter Pineta, the realtor for that space, it will be occupied by  "Curves for Women," a full service beauty salon, a dry cleaners and a coffee shop. Earlier we  had been advised the restaurant, Charlie's Front and Back Door, was to be one of the occupants  but evidently they could not reach agreement with TRICOR, the owners of the empty Eckerds  building, about the joint use of their parking lot. The committee I chair still needs to review the  plans for this new building regarding signage and lighting.     SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY  -Larry Buynak, Manager/Safety Director,Sandia Heights Security  The residents of lower San Rafael Ave. failed in their attempt to get speed humps despite  their unanimous agreement and county data showing high rates of speeding that meet the criteria  for such control devices.  In the final stage of the approval process, the Bernalillo County Fire  Department determined, based on emergency response concerns, that speed humps should not be  installed on this roadway.  We are looking into ways of getting this decision reversed.  This letter is in response to the resident who states in the GRIT that “Sandia Heights Security  has no interest in helping out here” with regard to the drag racing problem on Tramway  Boulevard.  As a licensed Private Patrol Operator we do not have the authority to enforce  traffic laws.  When our patrol officers observe drag racing or any other illegal activity, they  report it immediately to the Bernalillo County Sheriff or Albuquerque Police Department. The  patrol officer was correct in advising this resident to contact law enforcement directly, because  civil complaints must come from the residents. Our primary concern is for the security and safety  of the residents in Sandia Heights, but the associated noise with drag racing is also a valid  concern.  Residents of Sandia Heights often call with various concerns and we do respond.  In  fact, during December we responded to 146 calls and 1,804 calls during the year.  Sandia  Heights Security takes pride in doing all we can to make our neighborhood as safe as possible  and would suggest that all residents do the same.    It is important to note that not all Sandia Heights residents contribute dues to the Patrol  Service (this resident included).  We urge those who are not members to sign up and participate  like the vast majority of Sandia Heights residents who do, in order to be part of solving the  problem rather than simply complaining about it.  We agree that the drag racing danger and noise  on Tramway has become a problem and we encourage all of our residents to contact City and  County Representatives, as well as the local law enforcement agencies who have the authority to  ticket the offenders.  Ultimately, our concern is for the safety of ALL Sandia Heights residents,  members or not.   Page 7  LETTER TO THE EDITOR  (The comments and opinions expressed do not necessarily represent the views of the SHHA)    Use the Pedestrian Paths on Tramway  To the mom and dad who complained about the speeding white SUV in the last GRIT: I am  definitely for safe driving and speed control on our overgrown and curvy Sandia Heights roads.   But for the life of me, I do not understand the thought process that would take three "training  wheeled" children out on these roads and risk their lives to prove a point. We have miles of  beautiful paved and wide safe bike paths at the bottom of all our entrances and exits from Sandia  Heights.  These roads we live on are not wide enough and not cleared enough to allow cars and  people at the same time.  It would be a different story if we had paths or walkways carved out of  our roads and if we did not have the Tramway bike/walker path.  I, as a mom and grandmother,  never allowed my children and now my grandchildren the opportunity to get in harm’s way. I  can’t speak for those who choose to walk these roads.  Even at 15 mph it takes just a few  moments to get to the base of the Heights, park, and enjoy the bike/walker paths without risking  not only the children's lives but the driver's too.  -K Belle Conway, Resident    SHHA MEMBER CLASSIFIEDS  These ads are also published on our website (free for SHHA members as space allows)          Excellent Housekeeper:  Has some days  available.
