  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association             April 2005    President’s Message – From Ralph Rudolph    There’s a lot happening lately in Sandia Heights. Don Wortman’s ad hoc committee that has  been monitoring commercial development along Tramway has expanded its efforts. It is now  putting together a petition drive to prevent the Mhoon property (east of Tramway at Paseo del  Norte) from being developed into a shopping center. Our attorney has also been researching  whether Mhoon can legally develop this property. The committee has also been interacting with  the developers of the property between Roberts Oil and the Quik Lube.     Another ad hoc committee is forming to look into ways to affect plans for the expansion of the  ice rink on Tramway Lane because of anticipated traffic problems. Adding a traffic light at the  intersection is a possible solution so that exiting traffic could turn onto Tramway Blvd heading  south instead of traveling over Tramway Lane or Tramway Vista.      Yet another ad hoc committee has formed to look into traffic calming solutions for San Rafael  and how those solutions might affect the neighborhoods it serves. Citizens in action instead of  citizens inaction!    By the time you receive this, our wine tasting will be history. I hope that it was another great  affair with more of us getting to know each other. I know that Vicki Criel and her Membership  Services Committee have worked very hard on this and are working very hard to produce far  more events for our members. Sandia Heights should become a far more lively and friendly area  because of their efforts. Thanks!                    Residents continue to be a bit confused about the Board’s authority over the Architectural  Review Committee (ACC).  A common assumption is that ACC decisions can be appealed to  the Board. The ACC derives its authority directly from the Covenants which specifically state  that all ACC decisions are final, and the only “control” the Board has over the ACC is that of  members and funding. A similar situation exists with the Covenant Support Committee (CSC).  Members complain that the CSC “allows” residents to violate the Covenants. And yes, the CSC  is aware of many Covenant violations. Again, their power also derives directly from the  Covenants, which permit only property owners to file Covenant complaints against residents in  their Unit. If no complaint is filed, CSC cannot pursue a complaint. CSC does no monitoring or  enforcement on its own.   We will be having another ArtsView, tentatively scheduled for June 26th, where about six  Sandia Heights artists will have their homes or studios open to residents to view their work  from 1-5 PM. Two artists are already signed up. I’m heading the committee this time and  artists who wish to participate should call me at 828-3938 or e-mail me at  Rudy11@comcast.net. Last year’s event was quite pleasant and we hope to continue the  tradition. We are planning another Arts View for October.

The committee, Whole Foods, and Bien Mur  are working very hard to design an evening  to remember. The music should be elegant.   The choices of wine should be fabulous  (Whole Foods is donating $8000 in products  to this event). The auction items should be  fun. The food should be tasty. Our neighbors  should have all enjoyed themselves!    The proceeds will got to the Womens'  Housing Coalition and a Men's Prison  Outreach program.      Sandia Heights Fund-Raiser    Casa Esperanza provides a convenient and  affordable home away from home for cancer  patients and their families while the patient  undergoes treatment in an Albuquerque  health facility. They can use lamps, bed  linens, laundry detergent, towels, toys, paper  products, toilet paper and facial tissues,  hygiene and toiletry items (no clothing).    Keller Williams Realty is collecting items  on Sat, April 23, 2005 between 10 AM and  1 PM at 9201 Montgomery NE, between  Eubank and Wyoming. Vicki Criel, Sandia  Heights resident, has volunteered to  coordinate this event for Sandia Heights.  If  you have any items to donate, and would  like to have them picked up prior to April  23rd, call or email Vicki Criel at 615-3333  or vcriel@comcast.net.      SANDIA HEIGHTS  HOMEOWNERS  ASSOCIATION NOMINATING  COMMITTEE    We are looking for people who want to make  a difference in the SANDIA HEIGHTS  Community.  A number of Board members’   tenures are expiring this year. The Board  meets once a month.      Please contact Frank Soper at 856-5560,  Vicki  Criel  at  615-3333  and  vcriel@comcast.net, or Glen Cheney at   821-4493 and gtcheney@aol.com   The GRIT                                                                                                                   Page 4  News from Your Architectural Control Committee (ACC)    The days are longer, the sun is stronger, the earth is in renewal and the sound of  construction is rising in Sandia Heights!  If this is the year for your project, your ACC is  ready to help you develop your property in harmony with its natural setting and  neighboring properties.    As you probably know, an application and plans for all new construction, additions,  remodels and other exterior changes to your property must be submitted to, and approved  by, the ACC before you start work on your project.  This includes not only new  construction and additions but also walls and fencing, outbuildings, landscaping, pools,  re-roofing, re-stuccoing, driveway paving/repaving, air conditioning and solar panels, etc.      Here are some steps that will speed your project along:    Submit Your Application and Plans and Obtain ACC Approval.  Applications are  available at the SHHA office or on the SHHA website at  http://www.sandiahomeowners.org/forms.html.   If you pick up your application at the  SHHA office you will be provided with any ACC Design Guidelines that apply to your  project. If you download off the internet, remember to download the appropriate  guideline(s) as well.       Apply for a Preliminary Approval.  New construction, major exterior changes, walls in  setback areas, and changes to nonconforming structures can benefit most from this simple  procedure.  Go for approval before you commit to detail/construction drawings.  This  simple step can spot problems early in the design process and save you time and rework.      Wait for ACC Approval Before You Start Work.  Interrupting work after it is started is  frustrating, time consuming, and potentially expensive.  In order to avoid unnecessary  waste, if there is a potential issue of covenant non-compliance, the ACC must stop work  on a project until it can be studied/altered and approved.  Make sure that you have  approval in writing from the ACC before you start any work.    Secure Approval of Changes Before Starting Work on Them.  Projects of all sizes can  require changes from the original drawings.  When this happens, remember to secure  approval from the ACC before starting work on the change.    Remember the SHHA office staff and the ACC stand ready to assist at all stages of your  project.  Just ask!  Together we can continue the traditions that set Sandia Heights apart!  _______________________________  Is there construction in your neighborhood?  Do you want to know what is going on?

I emailed Tim Cummins about  the drag racing problem on Tramway. I received a phone  call from his assistant who told me that Cummins met  with the Sheriff on Friday, Feb. 18th. The Sheriff assured  Cummins that the problem would be taken care of.  If you hear the drag racing noise, please call 768- 4160, the Sheriff’s dispatcher. When I called last  weekend to report the noise, I was told I was the 15th call  about the problem. Sure enough, I looked out my window  and saw police cars swarming all over the intersection of  San Bernardino and Tramway. Our phone calls make a  difference.  It’s not just the drag racing noise that’s a problem.  Driving on Paseo or Tramway when the drag racers are  present is dangerous. What I’ve heard from some  residents in Quail Run is that since the drag racing began,  vandalism has occurred in their neighborhood.  Conclusion: other, more serious, offenses occur as a  result of the lawbreakers driving in our neighborhood.  We’ve got to shut them down. Your phone calls to the  Sheriff’s dispatcher will do the job. Thanks.

Covenant Support Committee  - Frank Soper  During the past month the Covenant Support Committee members have encountered three  covenant violators who chose to ignore our contacts requesting compliance. This made it  necessary to involve the SHHA attorney which, while resulting in compliance within a short time,  was an unnecessary and unwanted expense for SHHA. CSC is quite willing to work out any  controversy about a violation with the involved parties; we only ask that the violator respond to  our request instead of ignoring it.  The Covenant Review Committee received input from ten residents who volunteered to  critique the proposed Unified Covenants. Some suggestions will be incorporated into the final  version. We want to thank each volunteer for their effort. Also, due to a newsletter we received  from the Community Association Institute regarding protection of scenic views, we requested and  received legal input form the SHHA attorney, which has now been included. We plan to present a  final version to the Board of Directors at the April 12th meeting, and hope for approval soon  thereafter.  The CRC met on March 19th to plan and initiate the residents’ outreach phase. One resident  who has significant experience in marketing has volunteered to work with us in this effort. We  would welcome all residents who would be willing to help communicate the benefits of the  proposed Unified Covenants.  We anticipate that the outreach process will require at least five months, and we hope to be  able to ask the residents for their vote in early fall.
