  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association               June 2005    Past President’s Message  By Ralph Rudolph    As you may know by now, I’ve decided to not run for the Board again and have stepped down from  being president-elect. I’ve become too involved with marketing my wife Penny’s new book and with  the Nob Hill Art Gallery. I wish our new president Ed Whitten and the rest of the Board luck over the  upcoming year in resolving some of our more interesting issues.     "Secretary's Comments":  By Ed Whitten  "As a result of Ralph Rudolph's decision not to run for another  term on the Board of Directors (BOD), the BOD held a re- election of officers. The following are the results of the May  election and they supercede the April results:    Ed Whitten was elected President  Tom Coyne was elected Vice President  Marsha Thole was elected Secretary  Glen Cheney was elected Treasurer(unchanged from the April elections)      SHHA Annual/Town Hall Meeting  Church of the Good Shepherd on Tennyson, 10 AM – 1 PM, June 4th 2005    Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and various refreshments will be available.  There’s a lot going on lately in Sandia Heights, from the possible development of the Mhoon  property at Paseo del Norte and Tramway, the ice rink expansion, to the issue of speed humps.  Come and make your input known. Business to be conducted includes:  • Introduction of new officers elected by the Board.  • Presentations by the SHHA Committee Chairmen and Officers.  • Election of new Board members to replace outgoing Board members.  • Voting on changes to SHHA’s Bylaws.

Traffic, Safety and Environmental   By Mark Boslough         The past year has been a busy one for the Traffic, Safety, &  Environment Committee. Foremost was our role as a conduit for  information between Sandia Heights residents and Bernalillo County,  helping to get comments (both supportive and critical) about traffic  calming to the public works department so all interested parties could  have input.  We helped constitute an ad hoc committee to study  speeding and make recommendations for how to improve safety on  San Rafael Ave. We are also developing a plan for pedestrian paths in  Sandia Heights. We are helping the residents of the neighborhood  near the Outpost skating rink deal with possible traffic problems  associated with the proposed expansion of that business. We continue,  as specified by our charter, to help residents who want speed humps  on their neighborhood streets. We are also investigating response  times for emergency vehicles coming to Sandia Heights, and have  asked the county to make changes that will cut the large time lags that  are preventable.    San Rafael Ave       In the past year, Bernalillo County tried an experimental traffic  calming method called "one-way chokers" on San Rafael Ave. The  Traffic, Safety, & Environment Committee spearheaded the effort  to get broad neighborhood feedback to the county. The SHHA  went well beyond county requirements by actively soliciting the  opinions of residents who did not live in the immediate  neighborhood, because we felt that they should be heard too. These  devices proved to be extremely unpopular and insufficiently  effective. In part due to this feedback, Bernalillo County chose to  replace them with speed humps (as was originally requested by a  unanimous petition by residents of the affected neighborhood.)  SHHA's expanded its community outreach by forming an ad-hoc  committee, primarily made up of residents who live on or  commute on San Rafael Ave. Unfortunately, the timing for the  creation of the committee was poor. The residents of San Rafael  had already been waiting nearly two years since their petition for  speed humps, and the county finally installed them right after a  survey was circulated. According to the survey, the majority of  respondents want to try to separate pedestrians from vehicles by  building a pedestrian trail. We are now in the process of getting  estimates and proposing a pilot project to put a trail along San  Bernardino between Little Cloud Park and Tramway Lane, in  collaboration with the Parks and New Development Committee.   Such a walkway along San Rafael would be an extremely  expensive undertaking and volunteers are needed to look for ways  of funding this project.  Continued on page 4  The GRIT                                                                     Page 4  Traffic, Safety and Environmental  continued  By Mark Boslough    Emergency Response Times  There was some concern that speed humps  might delay emergency vehicles by a few  seconds. This led our committee to investigate  existing emergency response times to  determine whether these seconds are balanced  by the increased traffic safety resulting from  the traffic calming devices.  We discovered  several factors that cause significant response  delays that are of much greater magnitude  than those expected from traffic calming.    1) The response time to 911 calls from cell  phones can be 8 to 12 minutes longer than for  landlines, because they go through the city  dispatcher. This is a significant safely issue,  because more and more people in our  neighborhood are going wireless, having only  cell phones. Since this delay is entirely  bureaucratic, it should be fixable. We have  asked the county if there is a way to remedy  the problem.    2) The fire station on Paseo del Norte does not  have direct access to the main road.  Emergency equipment must take the frontage  road, which has a rather circuitous route, and  then the vehicles must turn on Lowell and  again on Paseo del Norte. We have asked the  county to provide estimates of the associated  delays, and to look into to fixing it by  providing direct access from the fire station to  Paseo del Norte.    3) Sandia Heights has no uniform street  address numbering system. We plan to address  this by proposing that SHHA provide large  high-contrast reflective address numerals to  our residents. This would aid emergency  vehicle drivers and significantly shorten  average response times.        Our streets are multi-use  This is obvious to most residents, but is worth  repeating. We have no sidewalks, and we live  in a semi-rural environment.  Our streets are  intended to be used not just by motorized  vehicles, but also by bicyclists, pedestrians,  and other modes of transportation. With 15  mph speed limits, our streets should be safe  for dog-walking, roller skating, after-dinner  family strolls, pushing baby carriages, walking  in social groups, and taking children to the  school bus. Most residents understand that this  requires common courtesy and neighborliness.   Slow down for pedestrians when you are  driving. Give bicycles a wide berth.  Walk  single-file when a car is coming.  Walk on the  left; ride on the right (where visibility  permits). That's what makes people want to  live here, and that's what keeps property  values high!    Committee members needed  The Traffic, Safety, & Environment  Committee has a lot of work to do next year  and we need new members. We are  particularly interested in recruiting parents  with young children, a demographic that is  growing in Sandia Heights but under- represented on the SHHA board. We also need  volunteers who can help write proposals to get  capital improvement funds in order to build  pedestrian walkways along our main roads.

On Friday, April  1, a traffic survey for San Rafael Ave. was sent  to residents of Units 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17.   Thank you to everyone who responded to the  survey.  We appreciate your suggestions and  feedback.         The timing of the survey was not optimal,  since Bernalillo County installed speed humps  on the lower portion of San Rafael Ave. the  following Tuesday, April 5.  This lack of  communication was upsetting to some  respondents.  We understand this reaction and  were frustrated ourselves at the disconnection  between our actions and those of the County.   No one on the ad hoc committee, or the SHHA  Board, was notified of the County’s intentions  to install speed humps before they actually  appeared.  We were as surprised as everyone  else.       As for the survey, responses were varied as to  how satisfied residents are with traffic  conditions on the street.  There were 262  surveys sent out and 65 were returned by the  May 2 deadline.  Of those 65 who responded,  approximately half were satisfied with traffic  conditions and half were not.  When it came to  choosing ways to change traffic conditions, the  responses were less evenly divided. (Please see  chart on following page.) The sentiment most  often voiced was that a pedestrian pathway  should be installed along San Rafael Ave. in  conjunction with raising the speed limit to 20 or  25 mph.  The general consensus among those  advocating this idea was that removing  pedestrians from the street was the most  effective way to increase safety for all users.         All of the information compiled from the  survey was given to the SHHA Board at the  May 11 Board meeting.  The Board is taking the  information under consideration with regards to  future decisions involving traffic safety in  Sandia Heights.  Both the information compiled  by the committee and the completed surveys are  available in the SHHA office at 2 San Rafael  Ave., NE for anyone who is interested in a more  detailed account of the issue.       Again, we want to thank everyone who  participated in the survey for sharing his or her  viewpoints and concerns with us.          Soil Analysis Indicates Sandia  Heights Soil Is Neutral  By Bob Francis         A recent analysis of the soil in Sandia Heights  indicates a pH of 7.5. A breakdown of the  elements shows the following:     Nitrate     moderate    Phosphorus     very high    Potassium   high    Magnesium   very low    Calcium   very low    Iron    very high    Copper   high    Zinc   high    Manganese   very high       I realize that not all of Sandia Heights fits this  profile. However, this soil analysis is very  typical for our area.       So what does this soil analysis mean to the  gardeners in Sandia Heights? The short answer  is if you add nitrogen to your soil, it is going to  help your plants.  Miracle Gro for example  contains 15% nitrogen. This is not an  endorsement of Miracle Gro. Gardeners should  always read the make up of the fertilizer  analysis when purchasing plant food.       You have to be careful when adding nitrogen.  Too much nitrogen can have a bad affect on  flowers and vegetables. Tomato plants may  never produce if fed too much nitrogen. One  clue to watch for is the yellowing of plants.       Fertilizer is not necessarily a good substitute  for good soil. Plant nutrition refers to the  elements taken by plants that help their growth.  When preparing garden beds and when planting  trees, adequate amounts of topsoil are essential.

As part of its goal to offer more fun  activities for SHHA members, the  Membership and Community Service  Committee is considering establishing a  Couples Gourmet Club. By couples here, we  mean any combination of two people. While  the exact mode of operation is subject to  your input, what we have in mind is a series  of monthly dinner meetings in individual  homes, in which groups of, typically, four  couples each divide up the responsibility of  preparing, serving (and eating!) a meal. The  makeup of individual groups rotates so that,  by the end of the season, we've all had a  chance to meet new people. We may also  include a kickoff cocktail party and a season  wind-up party in which we all meet together  as one big group.    The overall goal of this activity is to provide  a pleasant dining and socializing experience.  While the meals should be elegant, this  should not be a gourmet cooking  competition!    If all this sounds interesting to you, please  fill in the form below and mail it before July  15 to:      Larry Anderson      150 Whitetail Rd. NE      Albuquerque, NM 87122    Alternatively, your response can be e-mailed  to: andersnm@aol.com.    If there is enough interest - we'll need a  minimum of 20 couples to make this work -  the next step will be an organizing meeting  to be held in early August. Meanwhile, if  you have comments or questions, please call  Larry Anderson at 821-3158.    Outdoors and Fitness in Sandia Heights    Is your body getting all the exercise it may  need?

Year-End Report from Your  Architectural Control Committee  (ACC)    By: Kerney Bolton    Thank you Sandia Heights for your  overwhelming support of your ACC and the  roughly 275 new construction, remodel,  repair & maintenance and landscaping  projects managed by it during the past year!   Your support is critical to maintaining our  unique and beautiful setting, minimally  impacting the land, building in harmony  with our surroundings and preserving our  magnificent views.    Response to October Town Meeting  Comments on ACC Operations:    The ACC has worked very hard to review  every application and monitor every project  in ways that assure that covenant restrictions  are applied fairly to all projects.  Placing the  ACC project log on the SHHA web this year  has turned out to be a pivotal change that  has hopefully opened the ACC’s work to  scrutiny by community, promoted  understanding, and improved the  enforcement of covenant restrictions.  The  ACC has received countless calls about  projects not listed in the log and it follows  up on each and every one.  The resulting  greater visibility and compliance benefits us  all.    For many of the same reasons, the ACC now  schedules Neighborhood Reviews and  Meetings for all applications for new  construction, major additions, and any other  work that has the potential to significantly  change or obstruct views.  As a result, many  projects during the past year have been  redesigned during the approval process for  the benefit of all concerned.  For instance: to  improve neighboring sight lines by lowering  building heights and changing roof designs;  to preserve open space by making changes  to improve setback conditions and by  regulating the placement of freestanding  walls; to ensure public safety, by altering the  placement of structures to address arroyo  safety issues; and to blend with natural and  man made surroundings by changing  exterior materials and colors.

Commercial Development Actions  Mhoon Property – East side of Tramway  Blvd, at Paseo del Norte intersection.  Mr. Mhoon has been notified by letter of the  ACC’s intent to enforce the covenants for the  portion of his property that is located in  Sandia Heights Unit 8 and to work with him  on any development of the remainder of the  property.      Maestas Property – Northeast corner of  Tramway Blvd. and San Rafael.   Mr. Maestas has been notified by letter that  the ACC will assert its full powers under the  Covenant for Unit 16 over any subdivision  and residential or commercial development of  his property    Outpost Ice Rink Expansion  The ACC  secured a legal brief from the SHHA’s legal  counsel on the development status of the  property, met with a group of concerned  neighbors, held a Neighborhood Review with  notification to 167 residents, and held a  Neighborhood Review Meeting.  After  extensive deliberation, the ACC approved Mr.  Martin’s application with appropriate  restrictions on the design, construction, and  operation of the facility.     Thanks to . . .   • Dick Brackett for providing continuity  after expiration of his term as  Chairman.  • Bob Francis for continuing as an ACC  member after leaving the Board.  To the SHHA Board for providing the  required legal support for ACC operations.    W. L. Jackson Park – Update  by Bob Christman       We have finally received approval from the  state of NM legislature to finish the park. Funds  have been approved to build the basketball and  bocce courts. Some of the funds have also been  designated to add furnishings to the park. This  would include the benches to be located around  the paths for viewing and another picnic table in  the shade structure. The installation of a park  sign will be located at the entrance to the park.  This will identify the park, as W. L. Jackson  Park.       We have been working with the County Parks  Department discussing future small additions to  improve some of the features provided in the  design of the park. One of them is a second  “Doggie Depot” to be located on the upper level  of the park. Another is adding more benches  around the trails. This will be a continuous  negotiation in the future.       The schedule for the installation of the  Artwork is still during the latter part of June.  The two metal lizards and the pottery shard  benches will be installed on the bank just above  the play equipment area. These lizards will be  covered with metal such as brass and bronze  and the artist wants them to be located where  kids will play on them. Locating them between  the play area and the turf should assure plenty  of use.       The artwork dedication is tentatively planned  for late June. We will keep you advised on the  date of this event.
