  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association           August 2005      President’s Message  By Ed Whitten    Many of you may have been at the W. L. Jackson park/artwork dedication on Saturday, 9 July.  If you were not, you certainly missed a nice and well-attended event. There were many well- deserved recognitions for those who have contributed to the total park effort. On behalf of the  Sandia Heights Homeowner’s Association and the Board of Directors.  I would like to echo those  recognitions. All of Sandia Heights is very proud of the park and I thank all those who helped  make it a reality.  On 12 July we had our first Board of Directors (BOD) meeting with our recently elected  officers and with a good attendance from many concerned homeowners.  The BOD elected two  new board members, Dick Brackett and Ed Tull. I would like to welcome both to the board.  A great deal of debate about the proposed speed humps on Tramway Lane was conducted at  the BOD meeting. The BOD tries to evaluate all the factors in these support decisions, including  but not limited to, safety, inconvenience to some, county criteria, etc. It is never possible to satisfy  all parties, but we try to do what we feel is best for our community.  Some homeowners said they were confused on the status of the “proposed” Unified Covenants  (UC). Be assured that all original covenant documents are still the governing documents and they  are what the Architectural Control Committee and Covenant Support Committee are operating to.  The status of the “proposed” UC will be provided in upcoming communication.

SHHA sponsored a picnic on Sun July 24. Residents swam,  measured the speed of their tennis serves, ate, and enjoyed watching the search and rescue helicopter  land in the middle of the event. Children and adults of all ages laughed with each other as they dressed  in wigs, stuffed their pants with water balloons, threw whipped cream pies, and participated in a  number of silly games. A HUGE thank you to committee volunteers. These people purchased food and  prizes, drove shuttle vans, directed traffic, delivered fliers, lead games, set up and cleaned up, often in  heat and rain. As four year old Zachary put it so perfectly: “This party is incredible!"

Traffic, Safety and Environmental   By Mark Boslough    Safety takes precedence in board's decisions  At its July meeting, the SHHA Board reaffirmed its longstanding  support for any group of residents that successfully petitions the  county for speed humps on their own street.  We recognize that no  decision will ever have unanimous support from the entire  community, but the Board feels that safety and acknowledgement  of the county process must take priority over convenience of other  residents.  This reaffirmation is consistent with the Board's  philosophy in which we stay out of local neighborhood decisions  whenever possible.  We trust residents to make their own  decisions—within accepted traffic engineering practices--about  how to enhance safety on their own street.  By the same token, we  support the decision of groups of residents who chose not to have  speed humps on their street.    This decision was not taken lightly, and followed much discussion,  debate, and community feedback.  The Board has a long history of  supporting residents who want speed humps.  According to the  1995-1996 SHHA annual report, speed humps were considered a  great success, and "clocked average speed has decreased from 44  mph to 26 mph on San Rafael Ave" due to installation on that  street.  According to the 1996 report, feedback was gathered from  the community, and "there has been overwhelming support in  Sandia Heights residents and requests for more speed humps."   Ever since that report, the Board has supported residents, passing a  resolution of support in 2004, and explicitly incorporating that  support into the Committee charter.    Multi-pronged approach to safety   In March, the Board created an Ad Hoc Committee that conducted  a survey of residents who live on or near San Rafael Ave.   According to the committee's report, the response rate was 25%.   Of those respondents, 72% felt that San Rafael was unsafe for at  least one category of users.   The top two preferences expressed for  safety modifications that can be accomplished within accepted  traffic engineering practices were 1) the creation of a pathway, and  2) the installation of speed humps.  The Board supports both  preferences, which enhance safety by helping reduce speeding, and  by helping separate pedestrians from automobile traffic.   The  residents of Unit 11 had already requested speed humps, which  have now been installed as a public works project.  Continued on page 4  The GRIT                                                                                                                               Page 4  Traffic, Safety and Environmental   Continued from page 3  The pathway project requires action on the  part of residents who want it. The county will  not do it for us, nor is any funding earmarked  for it.  Our Parks Committee has been  assigned the task of developing a project plan,  and volunteers are needed.  We would also  like to learn from past efforts in this area.   According to SHHA records, a motion was  passed in 1998 that SHHA shall endorse  Bernalillo County Public Works Department  to exercise its easement right in creating dirt  trails adjacent to the existing roadway 4ft wide  on Tramway Lane from the Circle K store to  Bobcat."  Since the membership of the Board  has changed entirely since 1998, we have no  institutional memory of this other than the  written record.  We solicit information from  residents and former Board members who  were involved in this effort, and why it never  came to pass.  The 1998 motion is still in  effect, and the project can be resurrected if  volunteers can be recruited to work on it.     Educating users  Finally, we recognize that education is an  important component of safety. Yet again, we  remind pedestrians to walk on the left where  visibility permits, and to walk single file when  traffic is coming.  We again remind drivers to  respect our speed limits even if they seem too  low.  The 15 mph limit exists because our  streets are narrow, winding, lined with native  vegetation, and frequented by pedestrians.   With neighborliness, courtesy, and respect,  there is no conflict.    Covenant Support Committee  -Frank Soper    In order to clarify the Covenant Support  Committee’s position regarding the status of a  previous requirement that a resident wanting  to file a covenant complaint must reside in the  same unit as the alleged offender, in early  2003 the Committee revised the covenant  complaint form to show that this requirement  is no longer in effect. The CSC has since  handled numerous “cross unit” complaints.   The Covenant Review Group wants to again  remind Sandia Heights residents of the  purposes and benefits of the proposed Unified  Covenants (UCs) which this very dedicated  group of volunteers has developed.    1. Our first priority has been to assure that  the proposed UCs will maintain and  enhance all Sandia Heights property  values by:  a. Prevent non-harmonious, dominating  residences by establishing specific  criteria for new construction and  modifications.  b. Establish the responsibility and  authority of the Architectural Control  Committee, to maintain the openness  and harmony for which Sandia  Heights is noted.  c. Provide specific property maintenance  requirements which can be enforced.  d. Minimize future view blockage caused  by uncontrolled growth of vegetation.  e. Eliminate open parking of RV’s of all  description, boats and unused vehicle  storage.  2. Enhance and protect covenant provisions  for earlier existing Units and  recognizing/incorporating unique  conditions established for particular  developments.  a. Recognize provisions of Homeowners  Associations and common area  requirements for “subdivisions” within  a larger Unit. (Examples: Cedar  Canyon, Quail Ridge)  3. Address the existing inconsistencies in the  present 32 sets of Covenants, which have  caused many controversial interpretations,  enforcement problems and costly  litigation.  a. Eliminate of ambiguities.  b. Prevailing party cost recovery  provisions.    Continued on page 7  The GRIT                                                                     Page 7  Covenant Support Committee  Continued from page 4  c)  Establish written authority of the CSC for covenant enforcement (not in present  covenants).  d)  Improved readability and understanding of our covenants in a single document.  2.  Grandfathering for complaint properties as per original covenants.  a) Allows for efforts to require non-compliant properties to be brought into compliance in  order to enhance property values.  One provision, which we had hoped to be able to include in the proposed UCs, was mandatory  SHHA membership, which is required at both Tanoan and High Desert. Research into this matter  showed that because it was not part of the original covenant, with one exception, this provision  would be extremely difficult to promote to all residents and could lead to legal challenges.      “Be Bear Aware” by Ed Whitten    We have had several bear intrusions in Sandia Heights in recent weeks.  With the dry  weather, abundance of Juniper berries and other late summer attractions, bears are coming into  the neighborhood to find food. The following information provided by the New Mexico  Department of Game and Fish is a helpful guide to follow:    Homeowners Secure Your Property  By making the following recommendations a part of your daily life when in bear country, you  can keep bears alive and yourself safe.  These preventive measures were developed with the  assistance of Sandia Mountain Bear Watch.    • Garbage – Store it in closed, sturdy cans kept inside a sturdy metal shed or garage.  Do  not put out garbage the night before a scheduled pickup.   • Pet food – Feed pets indoors.  Store food in sturdy metal cans inside a sturdy shed or  garage.  Make sure your garage door is closed at night.  • Bird feeders – Set out only enough bird seed to last through the day.  Hummingbird  feeders must be brought inside at night.  Hang bird feeders from trees, not on the porch or  from the house rafters.  • Fruit trees – Plant fruit trees away from your house.  Fruit should be picked as it ripens.   Spoiled fruit that falls to the ground should be removed because it will  attract bears.  • Wood piles – Keep wood away from the house.  It attracts rodents,  which bears eat.  • Compost piles – Keep them away from the house.  Do not add  melon rinds or other fragrant fruits.  • Beehives and chicken pens – Livestock and beehives should be  kept away from your house.  Protect them with electric fencing.  • Barbecues – Clean them after each use.  Store them in a closed sturdy shed or garage.  The GRIT    Page 8  Recent Activities  The May 21st progressive dinner and mini-garden tour  was a great success. We enjoyed appetizers at Joyce  Stalgren’s lovely patio garden, dinner at Dan and  Jacque Caudillo’s beautiful home and gardens, and  ended with dessert and a brief business meeting to  elect next year’s officers at Ray and Carolyn Ching’s  house. It was a lively evening of wonderful food, good  conversation, and interesting exchanges of gardening  ideas.   Our 2005 Garden Walk on June 11th featured 4 of our  neighborhood’s best gardens, starting with Chris and  Karen Bard’s attractive front yard landscaping that  includes a hummingbird garden, Bill and Laurie  Johnson’s gorgeous front and back yard (pictured above) gardens, David and Mary Colton’s innovative  backyard terracing, and Dan and Jacque Caudillo’s beautiful and varied gardens that present 5 different  garden styles in each of 5 areas: a low maintenance garden, a color garden, a native garden, a dog-friendly  area, and an entertaining area.   The club’s annual field trip was held on July 16th to the Lavender Faire at El Rancho de los Golondrinas in  Santa Fe, the site of a historic Spanish colonial ranch. We viewed demonstrations in the use of lavender and  lavender traditions in New Mexico, toured the lavender garden, and enjoyed browsing the wide array of  lavender plants and products that were for sale.  Upcoming Events: Our annual potluck dinner will be on September 21st at the home of Astrid Logowski at  1721 Quail Run Court starting at 6:00 p.m. We would welcome new club members who want to experience  the joys and rewards of gardening. We meet bimonthly on 3rd Wednesdays and enjoy informative talks on a  wide variety of gardening topics.

QUAIL RUN CENTER GETS LONG-AWAITED ATTENTION  The Quail Run Center, located at Tramway & San Rafael, has at long last received the attention it so  sorely deserves. The new owners are very “hands on” and have made their presence both seen and felt in  recent months. “We care deeply about our tenants and about the community they serve,” says Dan Rich of  Emerald Properties, one of the new owners. “We recognize that the condition of a property reflects on the  businesses that are located there, and want to create a center that will attract the public and enrich the lives of  the people who work here.” The improvements include a new parking lot, new stucco color coat, improved  exterior lighting and rebuilding of the signage of the individual businesses. A whimsical trio of quail perched  on its upper edge enhances the renovated monument sign.  Landscape beautification is planned for the near  future.    Prior to the renovation, the Quail Run Center had fallen into a state of disrepair. Kelvin and Dan Rich,  the father-and-son team who purchased the property and orchestrated the renovation, are experienced in real  estate renovation, having restored a number of historic single family and commercial properties that  otherwise would have been lost. Says Dan Rich of the project; “I find it’s really worth the hard work… to  hear the appreciative remarks by tenants and by the general public, and to know that the work we are doing  means better business for our tenants. Now, with the vacant space and the overall beautification of the  Center,” says Rich, “we are speaking with a number of coffee houses that could provide an inviting gathering  place… a place where locals, joggers and bicyclists would want to stop. The sort of place that enhances a  sense of community by bringing people together.”    The GRIT                                                                                                                   Page 11  Excellent house  cleaner.

Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  2-B San Rafael, Ave NE  Albuquerque, NM 87122                                              Letters to the Editor: END THE MADDENING HUM By: Philip Ciofalo  Edited by Sheraz Saint-Lôt     It’s almost two years since the Journal published the article, “Hmmm … What’s That Hum,”  and five years since this pulsing, low-rumbling staccato sound was first heard/felt in Sandia  Heights. Recent Internet sites have pointed to probably causes such as underground boring and  drilling operations, microwave cell transmissions atop Sandia Crest cell towers, high-powered  microwave pulse research units at the base of the Manzano Mountains on Kirtland Air Force  Base, vertical sync-pulses when interlaced at 30 Hz frequency, improperly grounded  broadband/cable TV lines and the combination of any of the above.     The St. Paul Pioneer Press reported that the St. Paul City Council has sought a $250,000  damage suit against a cable company for violation of electrical codes owing to faulty  underground hookups. On the heels of this action, residents of St. Paul strongly believe with  certainty that this broadband/cable installation, when coupled with poor hookup and faulty  grounding, is related to the “hum.”     The hum was first detected five years ago in Sandia Heights, at first as an intermittent low- pitched rumbling noise/sound, similar to a train yard, a distant jet on a tarmac, a tractor-trailer  truck idling or a ship turbine. Over the years, there has been a steady increase in the sound  intensity. Initially intermittent, it is now heard/felt on a 24/7 basis. I am not alone in this hum  reception as it is also being heard by my neighbors and in the surrounding residences. It’s all  around us. Consultations with health agencies in Bernalillo County do not rule out accompanying  health problems. This would appear to be more than a coincidence.      This is an appeal to our scientific intelligentsia. Whatever the cause, wherever the source of this  persistent and bothersome hum, isn’t there someone out there who can shed light on this  phenomenon? How can we muzzle/eradicate this intruder!
