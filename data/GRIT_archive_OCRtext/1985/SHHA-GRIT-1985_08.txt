The turnout of residents was  s:ma.11.  Thos:e present: heard a presentation by Curt ~ontman from  the Department. of Environmental Heal th on the plague and how to  avoid catching it: stay away from rodents, especially dead ones;  dust household pe·ts frequently with. flea powder.  There was a  discus:s:ion of covenant monitoring and control; most covenant vio- lations are corrected within a short time of notification.  AnotheT order of business was the el.ection of one-third of the  Board of Directors::  el.ecte.d t.o a three year term were Lynne Behn- f ield" Jerry Boucher, Judy Harris, Bill Jackson, and Don McBride.  The new officers o.f the Association a.re President - Rab Freeman,  Vice-president - Bill Jackson, Secretary - Jerry Boucher, and  Treasurer - Harry Criel.  The Spring Fling, our neighborhood "Tiny Triathalon" was  termed a success by those participating. It generated great in- terest in tho:se who watc·hed the participants go by and "hadn't  heard about it." The triathalon was four lengths of the pool,  three loops of the bicycle route, and four laps of the park.  All  who completed received a ribbon.. It was organized by retiring  director, Cindy Gorman, who deserves a big hand!  The day continued  with a feast of fried chicken, potato salad, baked beans, and pop  and beer, all courtesy of SHHA and the Tram Company/Alvarado Realty.  The triathalon, the open weekend at the pool, and the feast were  enjoyed by all.  And we invite you all to come next yearl  The new fiscal year for your Homeowners Association started on  July 1, which means that your ~JO du.es are due once again.  This  money supports the Newsletters, the snow removal, the park, the  covenant monitoring, the neighborhood directories, the Christmas  house-decoration contest, and the triathalon and picnic to enumer- ate some.  If you are paying your dues for the first time, you will  receive a directory shortly thereafter; all current members in  January, 1986 will receive the new,. up-dated directory also.

JACKSON, VP - S;H.H.A. AND lVIEMBER OF b.C.F.D. DISTRICT  5 VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTNiliNTi  July 4, 1985 was a busy day for many of the members of District  5, your Volunteer Fire Department.  The ?ire Station was manned all day on July 4, from 9:00 am  until 5s00 pm, with adequate personnel to handle any ·emergency.  After 5:00 pm all members were subject to call a.s required.  Things were reasonably quiet until approximately 8:JO pm when  we received our first fire call.  This was a big brush fire in ~he  area of Eagle Rock and Elena.  At its height the fire was almost a  mile long.  ·  About the time this fire was put down things began to warm up  at a fast and furious rate and we were hard put to keep pace with  it all.  However we were successful in containing each fire as it  was reported and culminating in one final large conflagration on  Juniper Hill Road between Cedar Hill and Tramway Road.  There were nine major fires in our district, all caused by  fireworks, most of which were of the illegal variety.  The Juniper Hill fire was very much a problem.  Many residents  seemingly viewed it as a spectator sport.  Not only were cars parked  in the immediate area of the fire, thus preventing ready access for  our fire~fighting equipment, but pedestrians too packed the roadway  and further impeded our actions.  Many were quite resentful at being  requested to move, almost hostile in fact, and several of the set  had the gall to wonder aloud what took us  so long to arrive at the  fire seenl  Many of their neighbors were already lending very mate- --cr-i-acl- -aid- -by-. j.oin-ing0 -a- shovel_hrigad,e, ably_ demonstrating real "Good  Neighbor" policy.  ·  All-in-all it was a pretty sorry exhibition when one considers  it a safe bet that the fireworks which caused the blaze must have  come from one or other of the surrounding houses, and more than  likely, fired off by teen-agers and/or adults living nearby.  This  at a time when each of the eight other blazes must have been read- ily discernible from the Juniper Hill site.  The really shabby low blow was that one or more of the gawkers  gathered at the fire scene participated in an act of vandalism and  thievery on the private vehicle of one of our firemen.  The enlight- ened soul, or souls, cut the lead to the emergency red light on the  cab of the pick-up and stole the light.  As a matter of interest,  you should know that in addition to many other items, we volunteers  supply our own warning lights and siren at our own considerable ex- pense.  Such equipment is not only for our safety but for the  safety of other highway users.  The foregoing incident is not only  extremely reprehensible but absolutely foolhardy, too.  Even after the Juniper Hill fire was completely extinguished  there were some none-to-bright individuals on Tramway Lane still  setting off illegal fireworks.  Several nearby residents attempted  to remonstrate with these people.  The reply that one received was  to the effect that he lacked the Spirit of July 4.  It occurs to ·  us that the only spirit these people had came out of a bottle.  You should all be aware that the setting-off of illegal fire- works is by existing laws a punishable offense with a fine of  ;iil, 500 and/or a prison sentence.  .  Sandia Heights is far too vulnerable to justify the use of any  type of fireworks.  Lives and valuable properties are at stake.  It  is hoped that the use of such dangerous "playthings" be banned en- tirely in this community and that the residents look for their  pleasure from this form of insanity at the organized and controlled  : .. ;.  ~·  er~.  ·- Welcome to another year for the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association.

The petition asking for the County Commission•s attention to  Tramway Boulevard has been submitted to the County Government along  with the request for a discussion with the County Commission at an  early date.  The petition contains 512 signatures of ;:>andia Heights  residents.  It asks for traffic lights, street lights, and left-hand  turn lanes at the major intersections along Tramway Blvd. and for a  speed-up of long-range plans to convert Tramway .blvd& to a separated  four-lane thoroughfare.  Our County Commissioner, .Patricia Cassidy, and the County Road  Superintendent, John Ramsey, are investigating the requests of the  petition.  They have asked the 'Iransportation Department of the  City of Albuquerque to consider the matter as it applies to the  intersections with Yfani to ba, Spain, and Academy, which are the City• s  responsibility.  They have asked the ~tate Highway Department to con- duct "warrant studies" at the intersections north of Academy to de- termine if transpor"ta.tion signals are justified.  They are looking  into the feasibility of installing street lights along Tramway Blvd.  It is anticipated that replies from the city and state agencies  will be available in time to al.low a presentation before the Councy  Commission by the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association probably in  August.  'Ihe Board members of' the SHHA plan to phone Sandia. Heights  residents to urge their attendance at that presentation in order to  demonstrate  substantial vigorous support for the improvements.
