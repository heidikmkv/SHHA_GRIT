rt has been six months on the job for the present makeup of  the 0rJ:::-{A .ooard of Directors and l feel confident we are making  progress towards reaching the objectives outlined in the previous  newsletter.  All of the members are enthusiastic and energetic in  pursuing the fulfillment of these goals.  A tremendous vote of thanks to board member Harry Criel who  initiated, ramroded, and pushed through the ;,::iandia Heights Direc- tory which paying members soon will be receiving.  ~esides an  alphabetical listing, there is a numerical listing as well.  Atta.- boy, Harry! !  Harry Ottinger has an excellent article in this issue con- cerning Tramway .Boulevard improvements.  r~:rs. .t'a.tric ia Cassidy,  our new representative on the Bernalillo County Commission will  be contacted to ensure this matter is brought before the county  commission at an early date.  Voting membership is now at an all time high for ~andia  Heights - right at JOO.  However, we have a long way to go to the  500 mark which is a.bout 50% of the resident owners.  Some resi- dents mistakenly believe that membership at the F·our :::>easons  Tennis and ~wim Club or subscribing to the Security ~~rvice auto- matically makes them a voting member of SHHA.  Not so.  On the  mailing label of this newsletter if your name is preceeded by an  asterisk you are a voting member.  we urge you to join and be an  active participant in the community.  Besides the comraderie and  cooperation that a large membership provides for the community,  it also provides financial stren~th to accomplish things we have  not been able to do in the past.  Our legal representatives on the  Board are optimistic that successful legal action is attainable  against those who seem to regularly ignore the restrictions out- lined in the various covenants in ..:)andia Heights.  A strong mem- bership will provide your association with adequate funds to  support such action.  Naturally, it would benefit everyone if  persons receiving notice that they are in violation of a specific  covenant(s), would respond postively and in a spirit of cooperation  and concern for their neighbors and other residents of 0andia  Heights.  Most recipients of such notices do respond in such a  manner.  The subject of covenants is consistently prominent on any  listing of Sandia Heights issues.  It commandg a significant  a.mount of our annual. general meeting time and is an agenda. i tern  at every board of directors meeting.  Conversation almost always  focuses on the same few pointsa  monitoring, enforcement, and  who is responsible?  The board of directors has developed an approach that has  served to organize our thoughts and assist us in arriving at some  conclusions.  We consider that there are two types of covenants,  Class I and Class II.  Class I covenants are those that are em- bodied in and observed by original construction plans, e.g., use  ALBUc:;;JUER[JUE, NEW MEXICO 87122  -t- President's ~essage (cont.)  earthtone colors, screen tanks, certain building restrictions/  specifications, etc.  In this class plans must be submitted to and  meet with the approval of the ;;)andia Heights Architectural Control  Gom:nittee - an instrument of the developer.  The committee consists  of :11r • .Ben Abruzzo.  ~v1r. Bob N.'.urphy and M!'. :Vlax F'latow.  Certain  changes/additions to existing dwellings must also meet with the  approval of the ACC before being undertaken, e .• g., building addi- tions, construction of walls and fences, installation of TV disK  antennas, solar panels, etc.  Class I covenants are by definitlon  those that are involved with a prior review and approval process  mandated by the developer.  Class I violations are the developer's  responsibility •. However, the board intends to support the developer  in any way we can to assist in ensuring such restrictions and guide- lines are followed.  In the event that a Class I violation occurs,  the offending resident should address the developer if the owner  of the property in question fails to take corrective action.  Class II covenants are those that deal with conditions quite  apart from and seldom, if ever, disclosed by a review of plans,  e.g., exposed parking of trailers and boats, visible clotheslines,  inoperable vehicles, etc.  rv:oni taring of the co:nmuni ty for the  purpose of discovering these conditions is a responsibility  accepted by your association.  Letters sent to residents to deal  with these conditions have always carried the ~HHA letterhead.  While the association accepts responsibility for monitoring com- pliance with Cla.ss 11 covenants, enforcing compliance ultimately  a.nd necessarily rests with a resident-complainant.  The  ~H:HA can- not be the plaintiff in covenant enforcement litigation but it can  sure lend ver_y_ E.!£.2.M support.  The boa.rd will continue to attempt  to bring about compliance with Class II covenants through non- -li-tigat-i0n-mean--s.-- --- ---- --- -- -- Our major intent is to see that the covenants are observed  by everyone in Sandia Heights in order that all residents can  fully enjoy the special lifestyle afforded in this area.

The petition will be presented to City and County officials  probably in Yiarch.  The petition will ask for the addi~ion, as soon as possible, of  a street light, traffic light, and left-turn lanes at the nine main  intersections along Tramway blvd. north of Montgomery.  The petition  will also ask for a substa~tial speed-up in the schedule for the im- plementatior .. of the "ultimate" plan for expansion of Tramway Blvd.  between :.~ontgomery and the Sandia Reservation to a four-lane sepa- rated touroughfare.  Current City-County plans for 1985 include no improvements to  Tramway except those which have already started and the cut-through  of Academy to Tramway from the west.  1onger-term plans call for  four-lanes (separated) between IV:ontgomery and Manitoba at some un- designated tin:e between 1985 and 1990.  The "ultimate" plan for  Tramway calls for its expansion to four lanes with a neutral ground  to the ~andia Indian Reservation, for landscaping and bike/jogging  paths, and for its connection to major east-west roads (.i.iOS Angeles  and Richfield)leading across new river bridges to the ~est Mesa.  No  schedule has been fixed and no financing arranged for such an  "ultimate" expansion.  Traffic on this section of 'Tramway Blvd. has grown by about  60% a year over the past two years.  Additional greater increases  in traffic over the coming years is anticipatec as a result of all  the new construction underway along Tramway aY1d the further connec- tion of Tramway with the new major east-west thoroughfares.  The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association will distribute the  petition for signatures among the thousand or so domiciles in ~andia  Heights.  It will be a big job to do this and to present the results  quickly to the City-County au~norities.

SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY  *****  QUESTIONS & ANSWERS  What is the Sandia Heights Security Guard System?  The  Security Guard  is actually six different  guards  who  patrol the area in a prominently marked patrol car.  Who pays for this service?  The  Security  System is financed by resident  subscription.  The cost is $7.50 per month.  Currently+ approximately 85% of the  residents are subscribers.  During what hours do the guards patrol?  The patrol shifts are non-uniform so as not to establish any  recognizable pattern;  however+  the guards patrol between 90 and  95 hours per weeK, seven days a week.  What happens if the patrol car breaks down?  The  guards  use their personal cars with a  temporary  sign  attached to the side.  How many calls do the guards respond to in a month?  - - - -- -- The  guards  recejve 150-200 cal ls per month  of  which  5-7  represent serious problems+  Is there much crime in Sandia Heights?  During  the  three-month period of Sept-Nov+  there  were  7  burglaries,  15 cases of vandalism+ and 1 attempted fire-bombing.  In  addition,  the  guards  responded to 34  burglar  alarms  and  checked out 20 suspicious vehicles and 18 suspicious individuals.  How can I contact the Security Guard?  Cal I  the beeper at 843-3660.  After the tone,  you have 10  seconds  to leave your name,  address.  and phone  number  CspeaK  slowly and clearly>.  The guard wil I call bacK for your message.  For non-emergencies, call the answering service at 243-9888.  You  can  also  contact  the guard on his mobile phone  1843-1133>  or  through the Tram operator (293-8331>.  What number should I call in case of a serious emergency?  The  easiest number to remember is 911,  but be sure to tell  the  operator that you live in the County and in Sandia  Heights.  A more direct method is to call the Sheriff at  766-4160+  After  cal ling_ either of these numberst  notify the Sandia Heights Guard  at the beeper r1u.mber (84:3-3660).  If the guard is on duty, he' l i  probably be the first one to respond.  -4-- Is the Security Guard a substitute for the Sheriff?  No!  The Security Guard is not a law enforcement officer; he  is  not prepared to deal with violent situations;  and he can not  conduct official investigations.  Howevert the Security Guard can  respond quitKly;  he can checK out suspicious situations;  he has  emer·gency  medical tr--ainini;p  and he is in- direct  radio  contact  with the Sheriff, the Fire Department+ and ambulance services.  Does the Security Guard respond to calls that the Sheriff won't?  Yes!  The Security Guard has Jump-started stalled vehicles,  removed  birds  from fireplaces.  removed  snakes  from  garages.  looked  for iost pets and lo.st chi ·1dren,  etc.  In fact.  if the  Security  Guard can't help you,  he can usually put you in  touch  with the proper agency that can.  How else does the Security Guard help our community?  The  prominently marked patrol cart  the .security decals  on  mailboxes.  and posted signs in the area announce the presence of  the  Security  Guard  System -- and that alone acts  as  a  crime  deterrent.  Furthermore, the Security Guard is intimately famil- iar with our area+ so that he is aware of unusual situations that  should be checked out.  What should I do when I go on vacation?  If you leave your home -- even for only a weekend  -- notify  the  Security Guard.  He wil I periodically check on your  house.  In  addition.  stop your mail and newspapers (or have a  neighbor  pie~<  them up).  and put a  I ight on a timer (preferably in a room  that is not directly observable from the outside).  What else can I do to increase the security of my home?  o Install a burglar alarm system.  o Affix decals  to doors and windows stating that the  house  is alarmed -- even if it isn·t!  o Get a watchdog.  o Be sure your  house number  is visible from the street C3"  numerals on both sides of your mailbox>.  o Install deadbolts  (be sure they enter solid framing - not  JUSt the door trim),  o Instai l floodlights in both front and rear of your home.  o Engrave  your  social security number  on  TV's,  stereost  cameras. etc.  Keep descriptions and photos of Jewelry and  111or•<s or ar-· t.  o Be a good neighbor.  Get involved.  Report suspicious cars  or individuals in the neighborhood.  And report activated  burglar alarms  even if you don't Know the exact location.  o Above all - don't be a hero.  Cal I the Security Guard when  you. need he Ip.  -5- The directories of ~andia Heights residents are at the  printers; they should be ready for delivery by 1 February.

Cut of 915 questionnaires only 19  were returned.  ~even of these believed there was no need for  expa~ded playground facilities.  Twelve were in favor of the  playground; of these 11 have children.  Ten respondents indi- cated ~hat improvements should be funded by volunteer groups;  nine indicated funding from a co:nbination of ;::;HHA dues and vol- unteer groups.  In view of the paucity of responses from residents, it was  the concensus of the Board that expanding of the playground  facilities is not warranted.  However. the Board does desire to  achieve a higher quality of maintenance on the existing park by  working more closely wi~h the Tram Company.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Second Story ~atural  Sadie Flannery NTS, MsT  Jean Simms NTS, MsT  Jeanne Stover LPN, NTS, MsT  Cynthia W evers NfS, MsT  'Ilterapies  Natural Therapeutic Specialists, AMTA Certified  Corrective and Preventive Therapies  Therapeutic Massage • Colon Therapy • Nutrition • Herbs  Neck & Back Problems • Energy Work • Relaxation  Stress & Pain Reduction  7001 Montgomery NE, Suite 3 Albuquerque, New Mexico 87109 (505). 888-4084  February 5, 1985  -7- SL£  00N llWllld  'lrfN 'enb.lanbnqiv  0 I Yd  il9VlSOd ·s-n  ::uw )1108  HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE  TIRED OF PAYING  OUTRAGEOUS UTILITY BILLS!
