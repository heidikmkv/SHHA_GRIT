    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                            February 2008    President’s Corner       Well winter is here in Sandia Heights as I'm sure you have noticed. At this point in the  year, I'm halfway through my term as president of your association and I think now is time to  evaluate just what we have accomplished and where you--our members--think we should be  headed for the next year.      We have successfully worked two rezoning issues, instituted the free (to members) Tram  Pass and free (to members) coffeehouses at the church. The various committees have worked a  myriad of covenant issues, and the ACC has been diligently working to insure all construction  meets covenant requirements. I want to thank all of the members of your board of directors, as  well as the chairs and members of the committees, for the volunteer effort they have contributed  to our organization. They are the ones who make it possible for us to maintain our unique  community.      In the coming months we will be seeking your ideas and suggestions for projects or  changes that need to be made within our community. We are exploring ways to improve our  signage in Sandia Heights as well as working to replace the "blue dots" that mark our fire  hydrants--they were all scraped off by snow plows last year.     As an association we have many functions, but we need your help to make sure that we are  engaged in projects that meet the needs of our members--you! Give me a call at 301-4508,  email the office at shha@sandiahomeowners.org, or stop by for the office open house to let us  know what you expect your association to be working on in 2008.       MAIL THEFT  Mail theft is still a problem! We advise that you take your  outgoing mail to the Post Office. Just recently in unit 18 a box of  checks was stolen from the homeowner’s mailbox unbeknownst to  them. The checks were used to drain the homeowner’s bank  account. If the option is available it might be best to have sensitive  information like checks sent to your bank branch and you can pick  them up from there, rather than having them sent to your house.  Likewise, consider opening a post office box and have your mail  sent there. Otherwise, keep your eye out for the postman and get  your mail out of your box quickly. The closest collection box is at  the Circle K office. Pick-up time is 4pm Mon-Sat.

Most all other budget objectives were met. We are hoping for additional  membership revenue in 2008 to allow us to put more money back into the community.

Pinon trees need water during these  cold winter months. Pinon trees are not native to the Sandia foothills. They  normally grow in the higher elevations where they receive more moisture.  Pinon trees can become stressed if they do not receive adequate water. Stressed  Pinon trees send a signal to the bark beetle, which then attacks the Pinon.    Primary insects and diseases associated with the Pinon pine are bark beetles,  twig beetles, needle miner, needle scale, tiger moth, spindle gall midge, bark  moths, pitch nodule moth, Pinon tip moth, Pinon sawfly, flathead wood borer,  root rots, and mistletoes. Healthy Pinon trees that receive adequate water  during drought times do not become stressed, and do not attract the bark beetles. The Pinon tree  should be deep watered at least once a month. If your Pinon trees become stressed or infected,  there are several good tree spraying companies in the area. Check with the SHHA office for  recommendations. Pinon-tree spraying normally should be done in late April or early May.  The GRIT, Feb 2008                                                                                                                     Page 3  WE NEED YOUR HELP  AND SUPPORT  ~ Dick Cline, Nominating Committee     The SHHA is a totally volunteer  organization with a prime objective of  maintaining the unique character and  exceptional living conditions in our  community.   In order to do this we need the support  and help of the community in running the  organization. We are now beginning the  process for finding new volunteer directors  for 2008. Board members are elected for 3- year terms, with elections at the Annual  Meeting in June. The 3-year commitment is  revocable if your personal circumstances  change; you may submit a resignation letter,  although we would like to have members  serve at least one year.   What are the qualifications for the job-- just a love of this wonderful neighborhood  and a desire to work with others to keep it  vibrant. We need representation on the board  from all of the units and we urge you to  consider taking this opportunity to become a  board member.   The next few years will be an exciting  opportunity for you to help plan the future of  our neighborhood--your neighborhood.  Please review pages RG 8 & 9 of the 2008  Directory of Residents, which lists the duties  of the committees and other functions of the  board. If you are willing to serve as a board  member, we urge you to contact Dick Cline  at 856-1911 or email: nmrcline@AOL.com,  or contact the office at 797-7793 or email:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.    What will be your goal--to preserve the  Sandia Heights we all enjoy and love?  Serving as a member of the board is a  rewarding opportunity and we hope you will  join us in this effort. The board could also  use more female members and parents with  young children, to help bring more diversity  to the needs of our community. We will  accept volunteers from all units, but we  would encourage homeowners in the  following units to volunteer, since they are  not currently represented on the board:  North: 0, 2 and 3, South: 1, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15,  16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27A, 27B or 27C,  28A & 28 B.

Stats and more from the Sandia  Heights Security Patrol        Are solicitors bothering you?   Solicitors in Albuquerque are forbidden by  law to knock on any door where a sign is  posted, clearly stating that solicitors are  not welcome. Such signs should include  the words: “No Trespassing,” or “No  Peddlers,” or “No advertisements” or “No Soliciting.”    The "no trespassing" is especially important in addition to the  "no solicitation," security officers can then ask the solicitor to  leave private property. Remember virtually all of Sandia Heights  is County roadways and there is no County ordinance that can  keep them off of the roadways. Signs should be posted where  they can be seen from the roadway.

They generally state: “No trash shall be  burned on the premises except in approved incinerators located  indoors or within service yard.  No garbage shall be burned.   Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said containers  to be concealed from public view by an attractive enclosure.   No barbecue or other outdoor cooking facility shall be located  thereon nearer than ten feet from either side of lot line unless  made a part of the residence.” To check your covenants you  may look them up on the sandiahomeowners.org website in the  Covenants folder.
