  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                     Sep 2008    President’s Message by Sy Caudill  My BAD!       In my last article I stated that members could attend BOD and Committee meetings of the  association.  What I failed to do was address space and time issues and this led to an  inconvenience for some of our members.  If you would like to attend any of our meetings to  either speak or listen we need to know in advance as our office meeting space is rather limited  and meetings can run rather long depending on the topics.  Please call the office and let our staff  know that you would like to attend and they will put you on the list for that specific meeting.   Same applies if you desire to present information, just let the staff know your topic and the  Committee Chair will allocate a few minutes for you to present your position.  Both of these will  be on a first come basis and if space is an issue we may have to limit attendance.  These actions  are necessary to allow us to avoid overcrowding in a small office and for the BOD to accomplish  our monthly agenda of business and actions. As always a chair may close a meeting and enter  executive session at the chairs discretion.  However, some open time will be available at all  meetings if members sign up ahead of time for questions or comments.  My apologies to those of  you who showed up at the Parks and Safety meeting and were turned away, I should have been  more detailed in my invitation to attend meetings and I should have had procedures in place.     Speaking of Parks and Safety, at the August BOD meeting the board voted to approve the  following:   It is resolved that the position of the SHHA board of directors that SHHA will remain neutral  in all of these matters; speed limits, emergency vehicle response time and speed bumps.  Bernalillo County has the responsibility, processes and procedures in place for  establishing/modifying speed limits, emergency vehicle response times and installation of  speed bumps.        A great deal of controversy has arisen over these issues and we have a distinct division in our  membership over them.  Since the county has control we have determined that the best position  for the organization is to facilitate communication between the county and our members while  staying neutral as an association.  Elsewhere in this issue is an announcement for a town-hall  meeting chaired by the county on these issues.  We would encourage members with input on  these issues to attend and meet face to face with county representatives.  Officers\directors of the  association may be in attendance but they will be there in an unofficial capacity--speaking as  individual homeowners.  As a board and association we will remain neutral.     As you may have seen, we have been successful in getting road paving inside Sandia Heights  and also on Tramway.  Your association works these issues with our representatives and with  county\state employees.  We will continue to work these infrastructure issues as well as other  issues relevant to our community but we need your help and volunteer support to keep these  efforts alive.  Please consider joining us.  We have recently had two directors leave the  association and would very much like to have volunteers sign up to replace these members--if  you have some free time and would like to help improve your community please contact us at the  office.

My name is Dave  Mitchell, and I’m the County’s Operations  and Maintenance Director. Mr. Robert  Baker is the County’s Traffic Engineer  within the O&M Department. I was asked,  and am pleased to have the opportunity to  write a guest column to explain the County’s  response to a recent request by the Traffic  and Safety Committee of the Sandia Heights  Homeowner’s Association Board. The  request was for an evaluation of San Rafael  Avenue and Tramway Lane where 15mph  speed humps exist currently.    A little background on speed limits and how  they are set and changing them is in order.   All Counties in New Mexico are technically  arms of State government, so while the  Counties can adopt independent Ordinances,  Codes and Policies, they cannot supersede  State Law.  For speed limits, Bernalillo  County does not have its own set of  standards, but defers to the State Law  governing evaluation and setting of speed  limits. The County can perform a speed  study to assess posted speed limits at its  discretion based on any request that comes  in. In addition the Federal Manual on  Uniform Traffic Control Devices  recommends studying speed limits every 5  years where changes are occurring, such as  in Sandia Heights, where build out has  occurred since the original speed limit signs  were posted.     Obviously, a registered elected  homeowner’s or community association will  always receive top consideration for an  evaluation. Once the request is made, the  criteria for a road’s speed limit study is very  well defined, and a standard form exists.   Criteria include: 1. The type of terrain, ie:  flat or rolling topography, 2. The type of  development it serves ie: Residential, 3. The  classification ie: major arterial, divided  highway, or local undivided 4. The width, 5.  Quality of the surface, 6. Shoulder  conditions, 7. The sight distance along  curves or hills, 8. Average daily traffic  volume in vehicles per day, 9. Reported  Accidents, and finally, 10,11 and 12.  average and other statistical speeds as  actually measured on the roadway, along  with ranges of speeds by traffic.     What is not involved in this study is the  question of whether speed humps should or  should not exist. That is the purview of the  County's Traffic Calming Policy for which  there is no corresponding State statute.   While the two questions are not tied, one  affects the other, for example there  exists different style speed humps for  different posted speed limits.     At the time of this writing, the County has  completed one study for all of San Rafael  Avenue. Tramway Lane in the area of the  speed humps only, will be complete by the  time a town hall meeting is scheduled for  the County to present its results for both  roads.      Again, the studies currently ongoing are not  looking at whether speed humps should stay  or go, although there are some interesting  data points that were collected for speeds in  the hump zones. Mr. Baker, who is  conducting the speed study, and I are  looking forward to meeting with you at the  scheduled town hall meeting. We’ll provide  copies of the studies, and take questions.   We know that residents of Sandia Heights  are a passionate, intelligent and opinionated  group and like their voices to be heard.  Maybe fortunately this is an area where  there is not room for opinion against the  State study.

Bylaws Committee ~ Chair, Marsha Thole:     We are seeking comments regarding how the Association might  accommodate renters. In Home Owner Associations (HOAs)  where membership is mandatory, there may be various classes of  memberships. For example, renters might hold an associate's  membership and pay regular dues or reduced dues to avail  themselves of various authorized benefits. One common element  is that renters do not have voting privileges, but they are  extended other benefits that have nothing to do with the  association's governing rules. There is no transfer of the  membership itself, either. If you have any suggestions or ideas,  please email or mail them in to the SHHA office to the attention  of the Bylaws Committee.   The GRIT, Sep 2008                                                                           Page 4    The GRIT                                                                                                                                               Insert  SHHA PARKS AND SAFETY COMMITTEE                                         ~ Burt O’Neil  Sandia Heights offers its residents some of the most spectacular mountain and city scenery in  New Mexico. We have parks in the heights and a long foot/bicycle path along Tramway Blvd.  Unfortunately Sandia Heights does not have a system of foot trails. Joggers, bicyclers and  pedestrians share our roadways with automobile traffic. One must always be alert to oncoming  traffic and move off the road to let drivers go by.  Pedestrian walkers should be in the oncoming  automobile traffic lane so both the pedestrian and car driver can see each other. When a driver  sees a person walking they usually move to the centerline and give the walker room. This is a  coordinated maneuver and requires that both driver and pedestrian see each other and both take  evasive action. Early morning, when it is cool, and in the evening after supper residents of  Sandia Heights jog or walk. This is especially true  now in the summer, but many walk with their  dogs and kids even in the winter.   The key safety feature for joggers, walkers, and  bike riders is to be clearly seen by the oncoming  automobile driver. This is generally not a problem  during a cloudless midday but can be a problem  early morning or during evening twilight. The  SHHA does not recommend being on foot on any  road in Sandia Heights when the visibility is bad.  Walkers should consider the path along Tramway  Blvd or drive over to the Elena Gallegos Park.  This park is immediately south of Sandia Heights  and has a vast array of foot trails. One can bring  along a leashed dog. A year pass is available for  about $20. These trails are far from any  automobile traffic.  Our concern is to address the existing reality of  many Sandia Heights residents who desire to walk, jog or bike ride on the roads in Sandia  Heights.  The SHHA office has available safety vests to be worn by residents when walking on  our roads. The vests are colored an emergency orange and have highly reflective material sown  into them. They should be worn day or night. The emergency orange color helps during the day  and the reflective material helps make you visible in the evening or at night. The SHHA charges  $2 per vest for members and $4 per vest for non-members. The vests are on order and will be  available in September 2008. The vests can be purchased during normal business hours at the  SHHA office on San Rafael near Tramway Blvd.                            Typical walker with vest  /newmexico 888-285-0094 IN ASSOCIATION WITH w w w . a b q h o m e e x p o . c o m Register today to participate in our colorful array  of great home, lifestyle, and environmentally friendly (green) products & services!

Mark your calendars and plan on  being there.     KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK    Recycling Update    In response to  homeowner questions  about recycling  options, I spoke to Mr. Larry Buynak,  manager of Sandia Heights Sanitation.    As you may know, sanitation is a part of  Sandia Heights Services (SHS) and  they provide our weekly trash pickup.  They also will pick up large items such  as furniture for a modest fee, if you call  in advance. Although the city of ABQ  does provide curbside recyclable  pickup, there is no such provision for  recyclables here in the SHHA area.  True, the underlying reason may be  financial but it's more complex than that.  The winding and narrow roads of our  neighborhood present a special  challenge to SHS trash collection trucks.  Consider that weekly recyclables pickup  would require the purchase of an  additional refuse truck and hiring an  additional employee. Add to that the  high price of diesel and you can see  how it would be prohibitive in both cost  and time for a dedicated recycle truck to  drive throughout our neighborhood. And  after collection, recyclables need to be  transported to a private facility in the  south valley, then bundled up and  transported to Denver.    So, here is an option Larry suggested  whereby SHS could help our community  recycle. Depending upon community  response he could make available a  drop off area near the SHS office and  we could bring our recyclables to them  one afternoon a month. Now this would  be for paper/newspaper/cardboard and  plastics. Glass and aluminum have to be  dropped off in one of the dumpsters  behind Smith's. But this idea would be  handy because it is closer than the other  locales and shows community spirit.    I have also spoken to Ms. Kim  McKibbon at the Solid Waste Dept of  Bernalillo County. She is looking into  options that might include a dumpster  located along Tramway Blvd. Please do  read the web page at bernco.gov and go  to Solid Waste to become informed.    I would like to get an indication of how  many residents would participate in this  effort. Please call or email the SHHA  office by September 30th if you would be  interested.     ~ Alyson Clark, SHS resident    The GRIT, Sep 2008                                                                                                             Page 8   ACC Activity Log     The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.
