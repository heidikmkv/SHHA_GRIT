Please plan to attend  and make your input known. Democracy means involvement!        President’s Message by Sy Caudill    The SHHA needs member support.  For the past two years we have barely--I mean barely-- met our  annual meeting quorum requirements. Please mark the above date and time on your calendars and give  at least a few minutes of your time to help us make the quorum requirements. No promise--but we are  considering door prizes with the drawing to be held during the annual meeting. It only takes an hour or  so of your time and we need your participation to meet our by-law requirements.    Speaking of time--we have a few new potential board members but could still use a few more to fill  vacancies. We are always in need of volunteers to serve on the Architectural Control Committee, if  you have an interest please consider volunteering as a board member or just volunteer to sit on the  ACC for a year and help your association in an area where we need your support. You don't have to be  a building expert--we need folks that care and are willing to volunteer for a few hours each month-- give us a call at the office. See you at the annual meeting!    Two officers were elected at the April board meeting: Ed Tull as Treasurer and Marsha Thole as  Secretary. Election of President and Vice President will be held at the May meeting and results will be  announced on the website and in the GRIT.

Phyllis’s focus will be to get more of the  community engaged and involved. Phyllis having moved with her career has lived in OH, AL  and TX, all in planned communities. Phyllis wants to continue to improve our community in  order to keep it the “community of choice” within New Mexico.    Returning Board Member nominee:    Jim Irving, a retired attorney, had a 33-year career as an FBI agent and as a deputy district  attorney in California. He has been a Sandia Heights resident for 15 years. He served on the  Board of Directors of a Peace Officers Association and was president of the Rio Grande Jazz  Society for two years. Jim has already served on the board for 3 years and will begin his second  3rd year term.    We hate to say “Goodbye”   Lena Martinez and her family are moving to Colorado. In her 5 years  working in the SHHA office, she has been instrumental in keeping  the ACC administration operational, the office manned and open,  homeowners questions answered, along with meeting the numerous  demands of the BOD and the officers of the association. She has  provided exceptional service and was instrumental in the remodeling  of the office, as well as establishing policy and procedures that guide  the office to this day. Lena is clearly the one person that most of our  members can identify and relate to and she has handled this  responsibility in an exceptional manner. We will miss you Lena and  wish you and your family happiness and success!    We welcome Betsy Rodriguez, who, along with Sheraz Saint-Lot, will continue to provide  service in the SHHA office.

Bylaws Committee ~ Marsha Thole    Your Bylaws Committee has worked very hard to draft amendments  needed to make the bylaws clearer and to clarify some ambiguous  sections in order to meet the changing needs of our  association. The Board held extensive discussions, and we feel we  have come up with a good package of amendments. Please read  them and come to the annual meeting on June 7 to ratify them. It is  YOUR association and we need your vote. (See the Board-approved  amendments elsewhere in this newsletter)       PROPOSED AMENDMENTS (v.2008H) TO THE SHHA BYLAWS dated 6/3/2006    Notice submitted in May GRIT and on SHHA Website    At the SHHA board meeting in April the board voted to amend Article II, Section 2.3; Article III, Sections 3.6 and 3.14; Article V,  Sections 5.1, 5.9. 5.10, 5.11 and add 5.12. Ratification (vote for approval) of these amendments by the membership will be at the annual  meeting in June. Amendments to be ratified are in the May issue of the Association newsletter and on the website.     IMPORTANT: The section heading is referenced, and note that in some cases, only a portion of the section is being proposed for an  amendment (as shown by the “...” before and after the proposed change). Please refer to the present Bylaws for the full text, which you  can fine online at www.sandiahomeowners.org. You may also review them in the office. The original bylaws will not be read at the  annual meeting and the amendments will not be repeated. Please bring your copy of the proposed amendments in the May GRIT with you  to the annual meeting.    Sec. 2.3 QUORUM  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 2.3 Quorum Requirements:   All Association meetings as described above shall  require the presence of at least 40 voting members  including a quorum of the Board to transact  business.  Move to amend Section 2.3 Quorum  Requirements by striking out “40 voting  members” and inserting “20 voting members.”  Section 2.3 Quorum Requirements:   All Association meetings as described above shall require  the presence of at least 20 voting members including a  quorum of the Board to transact business.  Rationale: The minimum number of members who must be present at the meetings should approximate the largest number that can be depended upon at any  meeting except in very bad weather or other extremely unfavorable condition. (RONR pg 20 lines 26-11, 17-20).   At times in the past it has been very difficult to  obtain 40 members at the annual meeting, which then puts SHHA in jeopardy of not being able to conduct elections or transact business as should come before the  Association. By changing the quorum to 20 members, the association should be assured that annual meeting business would be legally transacted.      Sec. 3.6 TERM OF DIRECTORS  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 3.6 Election of Directors:   New Directors shall be elected by the Association  Members at the Annual Meeting held in June.  Directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes  cast by the Members and, except as otherwise  may be provided in these Bylaws, may serve a  maximum of two terms in succession. A Director  who has served two consecutive terms may run  for a Director’s position following one or more  years off the Board...    Move to amend Section 3.6 Election of  Directors by striking the words “held in June” in  the first sentence and specifying when the new  directors take office; changing the term limits to  allow for additional terms when approved by the  Board; defining a term; removing the sentence  that begins “A Director who has served...”  striking out the remainder of the sentence after  the word “Members,” striking out the next  sentence beginning with “A Director...” The  remainder of the section stays the same.   Section 3.6 Election of Directors:   New directors shall be elected by the Association  members at the annual meeting and take office at the  end of the annual meeting. Directors shall be elected by  a plurality of votes cast by the members and, except as  otherwise may be provided in these Bylaws, may hold  office for two (2) terms in succession or until their  successors have been elected or longer, if the term  limitation is waived by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the  Board present and voting. A term is three (3) years...      Rationale: It is difficult, even in an organization the size of SHHA, to get volunteers to serve on a board. The Board does not wish to discourage  good volunteers from serving by having a restrictive term limit. Likewise, the Board needs to have new members as well.     1 Sec. 3.14 RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 3.14 Resignation and Removal of  Directors:   A Director may resign at any time. A Director  can be removed by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of  a quorum of the Board for cause. The term  “cause” shall include absence from four  consecutive meetings of the Board unless  excused by the President, failure to discharge  the duties of a Board member as prescribed  under the New Mexico Non-Profit Corporate  Law or these Bylaws, or egregious conduct  determined by the Board to be contrary to the  interests of this Association. Directors may also  be removed by a majority recall vote of the  Members at any Association Meeting as  described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Any Director  who resigns shall not be entitled to serve on the  Board prior to the next Annual Meeting.  Move to amend a portion of Section  3.14 Resignation and Removal of  Directors by inserting a sentence  regarding a replacement after the  first sentence; striking out “four  consecutive meetings” and inserting  “three regular meetings”; correcting  the name of the nonprofit act; and  removing the sentence that allows  the membership to remove a  director for any reason, and  removing the sentence that begins  with “Any Director who resigns...”  (All other portions of this section  not specified in the proposed  amendment remain as they are).  Section 3.14 Resignation and Removal of Directors:   A director may resign at any time. A director who is also a  chair of a committee shall remain in the chair position pro  tem until a successor is elected. A director can be removed  for cause by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the Board present  and voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. The  term “cause” shall include absence from three (3) regular  meetings of the Board, including the annual meeting,  unless excused by the President, failure to discharge the  duties of a Board member as prescribed under the New  Mexico Nonprofit Corporation Act or these Bylaws, or  egregious conduct determined by the Board to be contrary  to the interests of this Association. The unexcused  absences of a director as specified above or failure to  respond to communications from the President regarding  same, shall be deemed a resignation.   Rationale: The Board constitutes the highest authority in the management of the corporation (RONR pg 9, lines 4-5). While acknowledging the  volunteer status of board members, it is also necessary that the Association be able to conduct business—which means board members must be  present and able to work, including on their assigned committees. Becoming a board member means committing to certain responsibilities and  committing time to perform the assigned duties—not just seeing one’s name on a board listing. SHHA operates under the authority of the New  Mexico Nonprofit Corporation Act. Without its officers and directors, the Board cannot conduct business nor represent the interests and needs of the  members who have elected people to represent them at the meetings The amendment also corrects the name of the nonprofit act.     Sec. 4.1 OFFICER TERMS  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 4.1 Officers: ...and no person shall  serve more than two consecutive years in  the same office unless an additional term  has been ratified by a vote of three-fourths  (3/4) of the Board...    Move to amend a portion of Section  4.1 Officers by adding language to  allow additional terms if approved  by the Board.   Section 4.1 Officers:   ...and no person shall serve more than two (2) consecutive  years in the same office or until the successor is elected, or  unless an additional year has been approved by a vote of  three-fourths (3/4) of the Board present and voting.   Rationale: This amendment keeps the two consecutive terms and further allows for the member to serve longer with approval from the Board. Since  Board members are asked to serve a 3-year term, this change brings the officer terms in line with the rest of the board members’ terms.         2 Sec. 5.1 COMMITTEES (portion only)  Delete restrictions on officers chairing a committee  Current Wording  Proposed  Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 5.1 Standing Committees: Standing Committees are those  established in Sections 5.3 through 5.10 of these Bylaws. Standing  Committees shall have all the authority of the Board within the limits of  their written charters, which must have Board approval, except that the  Board may set spending limits for each committee which, if about to be  exceeded, require Board preapproval. No Director may serve on more  than two (2) Standing Committees without Board approval. No Officer  as defined in Sections 4.4 to 4.7, except for the Treasurer, who  automatically heads the Finance Committee, and the President, who  automatically heads the Executive Committee, may serve as a Chairman  of a Standing Committee. All other Standing Committees shall elect  their own Chairman, although the Executive Committee may appoint an  interim chairman if necessary. The chairman of any standing committee  must be a Board member. A Standing Committee may appoint  additional non-Board members to their committees with full voting  status as they may desire, in accordance with their charter, who are  members of the Association having paid current dues. The exception is  the Architectural Control Committee, which may need to acquire outside  expertise to conduct business. Any official actions requiring a  committee vote by a Standing Committee require a quorum of voting  members of the committee. Decisions and actions of all Standing  Committees must be reported at each Board meeting, with a monthly  written report submitted to the Secretary for the Association files.  Committee actions (excluding those of the Architectural Control  Committee) may be subject to Board approval. The Chairman of each  Standing Committee shall prepare a brief year-end summary report for  presentation at the Annual Meeting, highlighting activities for the period  since the last annual meeting. All Committee chairs must also submit a  detailed written year-end report to be filed with the Annual Meeting  minutes.  Move to amend  Section 5.1  Standing  Committees, by  deleting the  entire sentence  that begins with  “No Officer as  defined in...as a  Chairman of a  Standing  Committee.”  Also, delete the  word “other’ in  the next sentence  after this one  being deleted, to  correct for proper  grammar.   Section 5.1 Standing Committees: Standing Committees  are those established in Sections 5.3 through 5.10 of these  Bylaws. Standing Committees shall have all the authority of  the Board within the limits of their written charters, which  must have Board approval, except that the Board may set  spending limits for each committee which, if about to be  exceeded, require Board preapproval. No Director may serve  on more than two (2) Standing Committees without Board  approval. All Standing Committees shall elect their own  Chairman, although the Executive Committee may appoint an  interim chairman if necessary. The chairman of any standing  committee must be a Board member. A Standing Committee  may appoint additional non-Board members to their  committees with full voting status as they may desire, in  accordance with their charter, who are members of the  Association having paid current dues. The exception is the  Architectural Control Committee, which may need to acquire  outside expertise to conduct business. Any official actions  requiring a committee vote by a Standing Committee require  a quorum of voting members of the committee. Decisions and  actions of all Standing Committees must be reported at each  Board meeting, with a monthly written report submitted to the  Secretary for the Association files. Committee actions  (excluding those of the Architectural Control Committee)  may be subject to Board approval. The Chairman of each  Standing Committee shall prepare a brief year-end summary  report for presentation at the Annual Meeting, highlighting  activities for the period since the last annual meeting. All  Committee chairs must also submit a detailed written year- end report to be filed with the Annual Meeting minutes.  Rationale: Removes the restriction that an officer cannot hold a chairman position on a committee, allowing for full utilization of the Board’s resources.       Sec. 5.9 & 5.10 COMMITTEES  (continued on next page)  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 5.9 Parks and  New Development  Committee:     Move to amend ARTICLE V.  COMMITTEES, by deleting Section 5.9  Parks and New Development Committee in  its entirety, and by deleting Section 5.10  Section 5.9 Parks and Safety Committee:   The Parks and Safety Committee shall consist of a minimum  of three (3) Board members excluding ex officio members,  and shall be responsible for overseeing park issues, working    3   Section 5.10 Traffic  and Safety: .     Traffic and Safety in its entirety, and  inserting the language in the charter for the  new Parks and Safety Committee, as shown  in the right column as Section 5.9.   with Bernalillo County on traffic, road and safety related  matters such as proper visibility along roadways, making  recommendations to the Board and appropriate legislators,  and such other duties and functions as set forth in its charter.  Rationale:  The Parks & New Development Committee and Traffic and Safety Committee often had overlapping issues to address, and volunteers on  one committee were often on the other, posing some scheduling problems and meeting with a quorum. Without proper meetings, business from the  Parks & New Development Committee that affected the Association had to be conducted within the purview of the Traffic and Safety Committee or  at a regular board meeting (RONR, pg. 299-300, §36). To maximize resources and consolidate similar issues, the Board approved moving the  functions of the P&ND committee into a combined committee.     NOTE TO MEMBERSHIP: The following 2 amendments to establish the Bylaws Committee and the Nominating Committee are for the renumbering  than the content of the amendments, as both were established in 2006 by the Board and do not need membership approval. There was an oversight in  getting them published in the bylaws; however, members will note that their proceedings are listed in the minutes.      Sec. 5.10 COMMITTEES – New one for Bylaws Comm.  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 5.10 Traffic  and Safety:          .     Move to retitle Section 5.10 to  read: Section 5.10 Bylaws  Committee and add the following  (see column to the right).   Section 5.10 Bylaws Committee: The Bylaws Committee shall consist of at  least five (5) members, two (2) of which must be board members, and shall  serve as the main resource in providing the Board with its authority, along with  assessing and tracking situations where the bylaws and related documents  (Standing Rules, Special Rules, Policies and Procedures Manual, Articles of  Incorporation) may need to be amended.   Rationale:  Section 5.10 is deleted with the proposed amendment to combine the Parks and New Development Committee with the Traffic and Safety  Committee. A new standing committee was established by the Board (IAW Sec. 5.11) to cover management of the bylaws, write a revision of the  Bylaws, and to ensure that the Bylaws and other related Association documents were being followed in the conduct of business. The Bylaws  Committee was established in 2006; however, it did not get officially published in the bylaws in 2007.     Sec. 5.11 COMMITTEES Sec. 5.11 renumbering the old to 5.12  Current Wording  Proposed Amendment  If Ratified Will Read  Section 5.11 Other  Committees:      .     Renumber the present Section 5.11 to  5.12 Other Committees; and add new  Section 5.11 Nominating Committee as  follows as shown in the right column.   Section 5.11: Nominating Committee: The Nominating  Committee shall consist of a minimum of three (3) and no more  than four (4) members. Two of the members, including the  chair, shall be board members none of whom can be officers.  Rationale: The Nominating Committee was established as a standing committee in September 2006; however, it did not get officially published in  the bylaws in 2007.  The Board experiences losses throughout the year; thus, having a committee in place to address the losses and seek replacements  is important to the continuity of the Board and its business. (Note: Section 3.5 changes and inconsistencies will be addressed in a revision of the  bylaws; for the time being, this amendment establishes the composition of the committee.)    4 The GRIT, May 2008                                                                                                           Page 7    ACC Activity Log     The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s activity  since the last GRIT.      7 Sandia Heights Drive – Stucco wall.
