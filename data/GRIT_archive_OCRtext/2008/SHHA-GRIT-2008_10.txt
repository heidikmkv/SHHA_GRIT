  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                     Oct 2008    President’s Message   by Sy Caudill  Have you ever wondered why we don't  have "Neighborhood Watch" signs posted  all over Sandia Heights? This occurred to  me the other day as I was driving around  and the only conclusion that I can come to  is that there has not been a need for them  in our area. I would suggest that one of the  primary reasons we don't need them is  the excellent security service provided by  Sandia Heights Services. This service is  provided by them, but at a cost to  members subscribing to the service.  If  you subscribe, it is only a few dollars a  month, then they will provide checks on  your house when you are away, pick up  the papers, respond to alarms, coordinate  with the Sheriff’s Department when an  event occurs and respond to events such as  wild animals or other unusual happenings.   As I've mentioned before I was out of  town, and at midnight my alarm company  called and notified me of an alarm--now  what to do?  So with Sandia Heights  Security cell number in my address book, I  called and they checked the entire  perimeter and notified me that it was a  false alarm. Needless to say I felt much  better and I didn't have to do one of those  midnight calls to my neighbor to check on  the house. I don't know where you can get  such service at such a reasonable  price. Those of us who subscribe receive  the benefits of such service, but non- members do not. So please be sure to sign  up before you need it. Those who are not  members need to know that it is a separate  service from your water bill charges and is  not included in your Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association dues. Non- members may benefit as I have mentioned  as we don't have to have "Neighborhood  Watches" and a marked patrolling car  provides some deterrent to crime for  everyone. I would encourage each  homeowner to take a look at your Sandia  Heights Services bill and if you are not a  member, please consider signing up for  this great service. We all benefit and the  only way to keep the patrol cars on the  road is for all of us to support our local  Security Patrol. Next time you see them in  your area, wave, say hi and think about  what you would do if your alarm company  called while you were on vacation to  notify you of an alarm at your home.    Security Patrol Reminder  The Security Patrol would like to remind  everyone that schools are back in session  now so please watch your speed  throughout the subdivision (speed limits in  residential areas unless otherwise posted  are 15 M.P.H.) There are numerous school  bus stops with children at or near them in  the mornings and afternoons. Also, please  be aware of an increase in bicycle and  pedestrian traffic in the subdivision,  especially in the mornings.  In the upcoming autumn and winter  months with our cooler mornings, don’t  “warm up” by leaving your vehicle  unattended. There is a spike in auto thefts  every year during these months in the  Albuquerque area for this reason alone. If  you must warm up your vehicle, lock it  and use a secondary key to regain entry to  your vehicle. ~ John Pickering  The GRIT, Oct 2008                                                                                                            Page 2  What is a CIP Project?   ~ Alyson Clark    The full name, Bernalillo County  Infrastructure Capital Improvement Project,  (CIP), refers to work projects designed to  benefit the residents of Bernalillo County.  They are administered by the Bernalillo  County Board of County Commissioners  and funded by General Obligation Bonds,  Federal Grant and State Appropriations.  Although SHHA may contribute seed  money to a particular CIP project, as it did  to Little Cloud and Jackson Parks, funding  and project management basically do not  come from SHHA. CIPs could also be for  libraries, improvements, utility systems and  roads.     The process for filing a CIP is described on  the web page: bernco.gov, under A-Z  Services, Capital Improvement Projects and  then links in the right column. The CIP form  has a place for the project description and  parameters such as location, scope and  expected benefits. You are not expected to  know the cost. Although an individual  resident may submit a CIP, the county  prefers that requests be accompanied by  evidence of “substantial neighborhood  support.” There is a county evaluation  committee that prioritizes the CIP requests  based upon various criteria. Applications for  CIPs are taken every two years. SHHA does  submit many CIP requests for  improvements. A list of these requests is  available at the SHHA office and has been  published in the GRIT.    Another matter, Capital Outlay Funding, is  important because it is paying for the  resurfacing of various roads in Sandia  Heights. The monies for road maintenance  and other projects come from the State and  are a result of work done by SHHA with our  state legislators, with whom we meet  regularly. Capital Outlay is a slightly  different process from the CIP activity  although we duplicate the road resurfacing  request in the CIP process.          Letter to the Editor:    Let me start out by saying that I was a  member of the San Rafael traffic committee  several years ago tasked with the  responsibility of coming up with the best  solution to keep the streets safer for our  residents. It was not an easy task, however  we looked at traffic calming devices and the  most effective that we were able to come up  with were the speed humps.     Some residents were upset and some were  quite pleased when they found out that the  humps were going to be installed. Most of  those that were upset were concerned with  the response time of emergency vehicles.  Although I found that hard to believe, as  most of these people were longtime  residents and moved into Sandia Heights to  "get away" from the maddening crowd and  thus had already distanced themselves from  emergency services. I also noted that the  majority of those that were against the speed  humps did not live directly on one of the  main thoroughfares into Sandia Heights  such as Tramway Lane, Live Oak, San  Rafael, etc, but rather off on one of the side  streets. They did not have to deal with cars  speeding past the front of their homes on a  daily basis as the rest of us did.          Obviously, there is little concern by these  dissenters for those of us and our children  that live on these main thoroughfares.     ~ Frank DiMaggio, Sandia Heights resident    The GRIT, Oct 2008                                                                                                              Page 3  August 2008 Treasurer’s Report ~ Ed Tull, Treasurer            CASH FLOW    ACCOUNT BALANCES      Bank Accounts  INFLOWS    CD #2  $37,042.21 ACC income  $100.00   CD #3  $15,364.33 Tram Pass Deposits  $450.00   CD #4  $103,845.77 GRIT Advertising  $0.00   Money Market   $3,503.36 Membership Dues  $13,463.01   Checking  $6,902.57 TOTAL INFLOWS  $14,013.01   Cash Accounts  $2,615.43     Total Bank & Cash  $169,273.67 OUTFLOWS      ACC  $9.57   ASSET ACCOUNTS  Community Service &  Membership  $4,227.50   Miscellaneous  $1,379.21 Communications and  Publications  $2,468.93   Office Equipment  $4,973.06 Executive Committee  $377.88   Office Furniture  $5,651.99 Insurance  $677.00   Software  $932.34 Parks & Safety  $394.80   TOTAL Asset  Accounts  $12,936.60 Office Expense  $8,997.89     TOTAL OUTFLOWS  $17,153.57   Liability Accounts      Improvements & Legal  Reserve  $146,592.00 OVERALL TOTAL  -$3,140.56   OVERALL TOTAL  $35,618.27       ANNOUNCEMENTS & NOTICES:     Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.

We had a pretty  dry spring and natural food sources were  meager, so the bears came down into our  area looking for food. Two bears were  trapped and relocated by the New Mexico  Department of Game and Fish. This may  sound like a good thing, but many people  are unaware that this is often the beginning  of the end for the bear. A trapped bear is  tagged, and if it gets tagged two or  sometimes three times it is destroyed. These  bears are hungry and stressed, and if you  release a stressed bear in a different  mountain range, it is not likely to survive an  attack by the dominant bear in that area.  Some displaced bears try to return to their  home territory and will die crossing  highways. It’s a pretty harsh fate for a bear  that is only looking for food. It’s our  responsibility not to leave food accessible to  bears.    Now, late summer and early autumn, the  bears are becoming eating machines.  They’re biologically programmed to eat as  much as they can in preparation for their  long winter nap. We have had pretty good  rain this summer and the acorns should be  plentiful. But because bears need to gain so  much weight before they den, they might  venture down into our neighborhood looking  for food – especially if they have found easy  food here before. Here’s what you can do to  keep bears from becoming habituated and  thus becoming problem bears:  ¾ Keep all garbage in your garage.  ¾ Put garbage out only on the morning  of your trash pickup day.  ¾ Don’t leave pet food outside.  ¾ Bring hummingbird feeders inside at  dusk (and take them inside for the  winter in October.)  ¾ Fill bird feeders with only enough  seed to last half the day (better yet,  don’t feed the birds at all for a  while.)  ¾ If you have fruit trees, pick fruit as it  ripens, and keep fallen fruit picked  up.    Bears are very intelligent. They remember any  place they have ever found food and return  unerringly to it. They know what trash cans and  bird feeders are there and will always investigate  them for food. We’re asking all Sandia Heights  residents to be tolerant, understanding, and  proactive. Enjoy the sight of a bear if you  happen to see one, but please don’t do anything  to unintentionally feed them.  Please feel free to call your BearWatch  Sandia Heights Wildlife Steward (Kate  Fry, 828-9618) or BearWatch (Jan Hayes,  281-9282) at any time if you have  questions.        ATTENTION - ATTENTION!!
