    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                April 2008    President’s Corner    Well if you haven't noticed spring is here--as evidenced by the gentle winds  wafting through our neighborhoods! Besides winds, spring means our yards and  all the vegetation will be rebounding and growing with the spring and summer  rains. This growth is one of the factors that makes our area very desirable as a place  to live. However, with home ownership in Sandia Heights comes the responsibility to  maintain our yards and surrounding areas in accordance with our covenants. I'm often contacted at  meetings or via email or phone concerning our covenants and how they are applied. This area is  clearly one of the strategic guiding principles that the majority of our homeowners want enforced,  therefore, I see this as a clear mandate for your homeowners’ association.     As in most cases, the decision as to application of the covenants is in the eye of the beholder.  Frequently, I'm approached and told that the covenants say "X" and here is how I view "X" so my  request for "X" should not be denied by--you fill in the blank--it is normally either the ACC  (Architectural Control Committee) or the CSC (Covenant Support Committee.) Normally it is the  ACC on future projects and the CSC on existing projects. In any case, these two committees are  faced with a daunting challenge; they must interpret and apply our covenants on almost a daily  basis--a difficult task. I would ask that each of you remember that the covenants have evolved over  30 plus years and been clarified by the ACC, the CSC and the courts over this entire period of years.  This has resulted in numerous clarifications and further interpretation of our covenants. The ACC  has the responsibility to review issues and make decisions on our covenants and their application  based on this past history and using a fair and impartial application of standards. This responsibility  resides with the committee and not with individual homeowners.     The CSC performs a similar function, only it is normally as a result of complaints from neighbors  on problem areas. Your Board of Directors strongly supports both committees. The ACC has a set  of guidelines that have evolved as the result of court cases, ACC interpretations and other  clarifications of our covenants. I would ask all our homeowners to contact the office or one of the  ACC members BEFORE undertaking any changes to the outside of your properties, including  landscaping and trees as well as construction or other improvements. In this manner you can help us  all avoid misunderstandings on what does and does not comply with our covenants. Remember, for  members the application is free, and a little up-front discussion can avoid a lot of correspondence  later on.    If you have a compliance issue and want the CSC to become involved, members may contact our  office and you will be put in contact with the CSC. Our Board of Directors and the various  committees are an all-volunteer group and we welcome new members--the next election is in June.

In order to do this we need the  support and help of the community in running the organization. We need volunteer directors  for 2008. Board members are elected for 3-year terms, with elections at the Annual Meeting  in June. The 3-year commitment is flexible if your personal circumstances change. The  qualifications for the job are a love of this wonderful neighborhood and a desire to work with  others to keep it vibrant. We need representation from all of the units on the board and we  urge you to consider taking this  opportunity to become a board member.  Please review the duties of the committees  and other functions of the board that are  listed in the Directory of Residents. If you  are willing to serve as a board member,  please call me at 463-7698.

The office has  Tram Passes  available for SHHA members. We  encourage you to come and get your pass  today. The office can distribute up to four  passes a day.    Here is how it works:  • First come, first served.  • Pick up your passes at the SHHA office,  2B San Rafael, and provide a deposit of  $5.00 per pass (check or cash).  • Turn in your used ticket stub(s) at the  SHHA office to receive a full refund of  your deposit.   • Passes will be issued for a specific date  and may be used for that date only.  • Deposits are only refunded when you  bring back your used ticket stubs.  • Of course, passes are available only  during days and hours that the Tram is  available to the public.    You must come into the office to reserve  your date and make your deposit.     KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK    STATUS OF OPEN SPACE   FOR 900 TRAMWAY    With the help of County Commissioner  Tim Cummins and State Senator Kent  Cravens, Bernalillo County hopes to  assemble sufficient funds to purchase the  10.3 acres at 900 Tramway Lane for open  space. Senator Cravens has requested  partial funding for this in the capital outlay  appropriation which Governor Richardson  recently vetoed. Assuming the Governor  and leaders of the Legislature can resolve  their differences over various legislative  issues, we believe there is a good chance  of receiving these funds.    Bernalillo County has some funding  available from the open space property tax  mill levy to serve a variety of its open  space needs. This county funding would  be combined with state funds to purchase  the property. The owner of this property  has decided to sell and it is currently listed  with The Vaughan Company Realtors.     In addition SHHA’s president, Sy Caudill  and the chair of SHHA’s Open Space Sub- Committee, George Connor, this initiative  has received invaluable assistance from  two other Sandia Heights residents, Larry  Ahrens and Vince Murphy.

Each year we get  together to discuss our needs. In 2007 we  acquired $575,000 for road resurfacing in  Sandia Heights. Those funds are now available  to the county to begin more road maintenance.  The road work done in 2007 was from funds  obtained in 2006. The county will soon begin to  continue road resurfacing with a priority based  upon our 5-year plan. The following roads are  currently in the priority list to be addressed  soon and work will most likely start this  summer, but could begin sooner depending  on the contractor’s scheduling:     • Live Oak from Tramway Blvd east to  Juniper Hill Rd  • Tramway Circle from Cedar Hill north to  Tramway Place including Courts    • Juniper Hill Rd from Tramway Rd north  to Rock Ridge  Dr    • Juniper Hill Loop from Juniper Hill Rd to  Spring Creek Dr  • Tramway Lane from Live Oak Rd to San  Bernardino    • Tramway Place from Live Oak to  Tramway Ln and Brushwood St    • Big Horn Ridge Court and Big Horn  Ridge Place  • Drainage rundowns in Tramway Terrace  Loop         Bear in mind that some adjustment in the  specific road segments may be made based  upon expended funds and unknown factors.                    Graffiti ~ Sy Caudill         Graffiti -- some call it art and some call it  defacing public and private property. We have  had several instances of graffiti in Sandia  Heights over the past several months, most  recently at the intersection of Tramway Lane  and Tramway Blvd. as well as under the arroyo  at the ACE/Gas Station area. It has been my  goal to respond to and correct graffiti as it  occurs and to keep the county informed about  occurrences to aid in prevention. Of the recent  cases, they can be classified as "tagging" or  "marking," and some are vulgar and offensive  language.        Our goal as your homeowners association is  to correct these as soon as we know about them  and here is where we need your help. Call us to  give a location and when you noticed the  graffiti. If you see it in progress call the graffiti  hotline at 768-4400, the security patrol at 856- 6347, and the county sheriff at 768-4160. Do  not get involved yourself but let the appropriate  agencies respond. Most likely you will be  reporting it after it occurs and the office can  handle the necessary actions to get it corrected.  Let us know, keep us informed and we can all  work to keep our community pristine.
