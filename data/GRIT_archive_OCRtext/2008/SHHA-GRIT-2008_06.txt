DEMOCRACY MEANS INVOLVEMENT!      President’s Message by Sy Caudill    As we move into summer the roadside growth will have reached a peak and the County will  be doing roadside mowing. In this GRIT you will find an article on how we have worked with the  County to ensure that our roads are safe for both drivers and pedestrians. Please keep in mind as  you read the article that the County actually owns several feet as their right of way outside of the  actual paved area.  That is the area that the County will be mowing and keeping cleared of brush,  as well as the line of sight areas at intersections. We have worked with them to keep mowing to a  minimum but still provide a safe view for all users of the road. If you have questions please feel  free to call the office.   Inside you will also find an article from our friends at Futures for Children. They own and  will be developing a lot next to their offices that border Tramway Blvd. Their goal is to raise  additional funds for the children whom they assist. We will be working closely with them as they  move through the process and will keep you posted. While they do not have specific plans and are  only in the initial planning stages, we thought it best to keep our members informed early and to  stop rumors.   The association has done a lot this year to benefit the members, from Tram passes to free  coffee houses to open houses to meet with the directors of the association. We will continue along  this route along with the emphasis you desire in maintaining our community by covenant  enforcement. We have some new officers. I would like to welcome Andy Anderson to the VP role,  Ed Tull will be moving to Treasurer, Marsha Thole is now the Secretary, and you get me for yet  another year as President. I want to welcome our new directors as well as our current ones and  thank them and our other volunteers for a job well done. Of course the front office keeps us all  going with Sheraz and Betsy holding up that end. As always if you have a few hours each month-- we can always use more volunteers.   The GRIT, June 2008                                                                         Page 2  Setbacks and the County  ~  Sy Caudill, SHHA President    As most of you are aware the roads within  Sandia Heights are multi-use, narrow and  winding, which provides many challenges for  both the SHHA and the County. We both  frequently get calls for more cutting of  roadside brush, clearing lines of sight at  intersections and other mowing within the  community—our chimisa is everywhere. The  county has been very good about responding  to our requests but have asked whether we  could establish a regular schedule that allows  them to plan for cutting to avoid frequent  returns for additional cutting. It is expensive  for the County—your tax dollars—to have  multiple trips to the same area.     To that end we have met with the County to  clarify what they consider the key points of  roadside cutting for County roads. It is  detailed, but in essence, here is what they  consider the issues: In an effort to maintain  clean and debris-free thoroughfares in our  community, the Bernalillo County Public  Works  Operations  and  Maintenance  Department reminds property owners that they  have a responsibility for the “setback area.”  The setback area is that portion of public land  along the road between the private property  line and the curb, or pavement, or edge of the  dirt or gravel lane that is driven by automotive  traffic. Bernalillo County Code Section 66- 225 (c) states: “The setback area and all  plantings therein shall be maintained by the  owner, occupant or agents in charge of the  adjoining property”.    However, the County can and will mow these  areas as a matter of ensuring clear lines of  sight and free flow of traffic on the roads.  Public safety must be the first and foremost  consideration when assessing the roadside  brush. Specifically, the County Operations and  Maintenance Department will provide mowing  and/or clearing both up and downstream from  private driveways, but not including private  driveways. The width of this service ranges  from 0 feet to 7 feet from the edge of the road  depending on the posted speed limit, pursuant  to AASHTO (American Association of State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials)  Standards providing for a “Clear Zone” for  traffic safety. Only certain items are allowed  in the clear zone, such as mailboxes, break- away fire hydrants, and break-away street  signs, which do not interfere with traffic  safety.     Based on all of the above, the SHHA will act  as  the  single  point  liaison  between  homeowners and the County. This will include  establishing a regular schedule for cutting the  setback areas as well as standards for the  cutting, such as using a 45-degree cut in most  areas to minimize cutting, clear cutting at  intersections for proper line of sight, and  removal of major growth that has naturally  occurred in the setback area. In general, the  schedule will be twice a year and as needed to  keep our roads safe for all our residents. This  plan will be implemented this spring as soon  as we can complete coordination with the  County.    If you have identified cutting and mowing that  is needed from a safety perspective, and it is  needed immediately, please contact the SHHA  office and we will coordinate the effort with  the County. You can expect to see our friends  from the County in the near future doing the  mowing and clearing as addressed above.    If you have questions or concerns, members  are asked to please address these to the SHHA  office and we will get back to you after  discussing the issue with the County. In this  manner we in Sandia Heights will receive a  regularly scheduled service and the County  has a single point to contact, as do our  residents. Thanks for your support and  cooperation in this effort.    One last comment—given our dangerous fire  seasons, this service will help eliminate the  brush that can feed fires.

Avoid walking abreast with others on our narrow,  windy roads.    • Be sure you can be seen. Wear reflective materials and/or  carry a flashlight when walking in the late afternoons or  evenings, particularly near or after sunset.  • Walk your dog on a leash, with the dog closest to the curb,  so you can prevent unexpected lunges at cars, etc.  • Be especially alert near overgrown vegetation that could  prevent an oncoming driver from being able to see you on  the road.

It will take some time for  the ACC to process your application so  leave lots of time before your planned start  date.      The ACC is usually able to process  applications for such things as re-stuccoing  and replacing windows, doors, and roofing  in a few days. However, more complex  projects such as new construction, additions,  remodels, walls & fences, and landscaping  can take up to 30 days. Remember, such  projects usually require you to meet with the  ACC and might require a Neighborhood  Review, so plan to be available for a week  or two after you submit your application and  allow two or three weeks more for the ACC  to do its job.

Do it in the winter time  before spring growth begins. Clean the  blades with alcohol.  • Give each rose bush a cup of Epson salt.  Epson salt contains magnesium which is  lacking in our soil. Best to apply in May  or June after rose bushes have been  trimmed.
