It was good to see  a rather large turnout for the annual meeting and the Town Hall meeting that  followed. I hope to see similar attendance at next year’s meeting. Four new directors  for the SHHA Board of Directors (BOD) were nominated and confirmed. The BOD  welcomes Phyllis Moore, Steve Walsh, Phil Abhsere and Bruce Childs. Jim Irving  was re-elected for a 3-year term. We look forward to their contributions in the upcoming year. Your  new officers are Andy Anderson as VP, Ed Tull moves to Treasurer, Marsha Thole is Secretary and  you get me for yet another year--thanks to all for volunteering. We thank Dick Cline whose term  expired, I hope Dick will continue to work with the association as he has added immeasurably to the  operation of SHHA. Ed Whitten will be departing the Treasurer position and I would like to thank Ed  for his service in many different positions within SHHA, including president. He has remodeled the  office, kept the finances in order, stream lined office procedures and donated a lot of his time handling  association business. Thanks Ed and Dick!  A summary of our standing committees was presented. Most all of these committees could use  volunteers to help with their projects. If you, or someone you know, would like to volunteer, please  contact anyone on the board. There is a particular need for help on the Community Service and  Membership Committee (CS&M), the Architectural Control Committee (ACC), and the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC). I would encourage anyone with an interest in these areas to volunteer.  We had a large number of proposed bylaw changes and most were supported by the  membership. Two drew a lot of discussion and ultimately failed. The first was a reduction in the  quorum requirement for the annual meeting from 40 to 20. This was proposed because for the past 3  years and maybe more, we have had extreme problems meeting the 40 member requirement--this year  being an extraordinary exception. If we continue to have similar turnouts the issue is moot, if not we  will need to readdress this issue again. The second proposed change that failed involved removal of  Directors. The current bylaws allow for the membership to remove directors and in the proposed  amendment this clause was deleted. If we could have entertained amendments to the proposed change I  think this could have been resolved by simply including the deleted wording.  However, that was not  possible due to notification requirements. We will readdress this issue next year and I will support  inclusion of the provision that allows for the membership to have an "avenue" to remove directors--it  was clear the assembled members strongly supported maintaining this provision.   A Town Hall meeting followed the formal BOD meeting. Several individuals shared their  concern on matters in our community your inputs are always appreciated. The various areas of concern  included – Antennas, Elm Trees, ACC actions, emergency response times (speed bumps), Traffic,  Tramway Lane, Water, and Cedar Hill Park Sign.  We will refer all of the issues raised to the  appropriate committee and provide responses where appropriate.  If you have an area of concern, please contact us at the office or e-mail at  shha@sandiahomeowners.org. We continue to welcome your input and I look forward to working with  the BOD, the members and our officers to continue to improve and maintain our great community.

Speeding endangers  others, as well as yourself.  • Be extra vigilant when driving our narrow,  windy streets, especially  when the vegetation along the sides of the  roads impair your vision.  • Do not talk on your cell phone or let any  other distractions avert your eyes or  attention from the road when you are  driving.  • Be courteous to pedestrians and other  drivers. Pedestrians, please  return the favor.  • When one side of the road is blocked and  two cars approach from different directions  on a steep incline, the car facing downhill  must back up until the car going uphill can  pass. (The driver going downhill has the  greater amount of control and better view  when backing up.)                   SANDIA MOUNTAIN  BEARWATCH'S TIPS FOR  LIVING WITH BEARS.    Dear Neighbors, Please read the following tips  on how to keep you and your family safe and  our East Mountain bears protected. You won't  see bears around your home if there is nothing  there for them to find to eat. These tips will  take less than a couple of minutes a day to  maintain. BearWatch wishes you a fun and safe  summer.     DON'T FEED A BEAR - EVER.......A FED  BEAR IS A DEAD BEAR!   Keep trash in a bear-proof garbage  container or stored in a sturdy metal shed or  closed garage. Put out garbage only on  morning of pickup.    Don't feed pets outdoors or leave pet dishes  or store pet food outdoors. Keep pet dishes  and pet food away from door entries.   Hang seed feeders from wires between trees  high enough off the ground that a bear can't  reach it. Bring in hummingbird feeders at  night. Feed suet and peanut butter only in  winter when bears are in hibernation. Store  birdseed in a closed container in a sturdy  shed or the garage.    Keep barbeque grills clean.   Keep kitchen windows and doors closed on  summer nights.   For small livestock and chickens use a  sturdy metal shed and/or a 5-strand electric  fence using an approved fence charger with  alternating current. Be sure to check with  the county inspector for guidelines and  limitations.   Put an electric fence around beehives.    Don't plant fruit trees or berry bushes near  your home. Remove fruit before it ripens to  stop bears climbing and breaking branches.  Remove fallen fruit. Don't add melon rinds  or fruit to compost pile except in winter.   Don't leave food, groceries, pet food or  birdseed in you car overnight   Don't feed other wildlife; it will also attract  bears. It is against NM law to feed bears on  purpose.   If a bear is drinking from your swimming  pool or hot tub, put water out as far from  your house and neighbor's homes as  possible.    Keep all poisons inside your house; also  many bears die from ingesting garbage  bags.    Keep woodpiles and junk away from the  house. Bears will hunt for rodents that live  there.    Please understand that a trapped bear does  not transplant well. A large percentage of  bears die from being relocated.

Spread dry coffee grounds during  fall and winter. Bee Baum and Four  O’clock seem to like the coffee grounds.  • If you have Chamisa growing above  your septic tank they should be removed.  Chamisa roots can get into the pipes  leading to the septic tank.  • Remove leaves from your flower beds.  Leaves can hide bugs which are harmful  to plants. Leaf hoppers and thrips live  under dead foliage.  • Leafhoppers and thrips spread Curly Top  Virus. Curly Top Virus destroys  tomatoes and may other vegetable  plants.  • Get rid of Purple Nightshade plants. The  nightshade plant is believed to be a host  of the Curly Top Virus and other viruses.  • According to recent Master Gardener  newsletters, tomato spotted wilt virus  have similar signs as Curly Top Virus.  Furthermore, the data indicates that  tomato spotted wilt  virus may be more of  a common problem in  Albuquerque than  previously thought.                   The Benefit of Using an Agency  for Non-Medical Home Care  ~ Katy Yankie is a licensed Master’s level  social worker        A competent personal caregiver can be a  valuable asset for seniors, helping them to  remain healthy and happy in their own  home. Careful thought should be given to  the selection of someone who has the  potential to successfully fill such an  important role, and cost should not be the  only consideration.     Questions often asked by elders and their  families, “Why should I go to the extra  expense of using an agency to hire a  caregiver?  Why shouldn’t I just hire my  own caregiver to assist with household  tasks, bathing and dressing, going to the  doctor, and other chores I need help with,  now that I’m older?” These are good  questions, for which I have a ready answer.   My answer involves some questions of my  own: “What happens when the caregiver you  hire is out sick or on vacation?” “What is  your liability when the caregiver hurts his or  her back?” “What will you do if there is a  problem with the caregiver you hire? “   “What screening procedures will you use to  ensure that your caregiver is well-trained,  monitored, and has your best interest at  heart?”  “Does the agency have a wellness  program that would have the capacity to  provide other team members, such as a  nurse?”     A reputable non-medical home care  agency has procedures in place to make sure  that the trust you place in the caregivers who  are entering your home is warranted. The  agency will check references, conduct  criminal background checks, verify  employment eligibility, and provide ongoing  training and monitoring for the caregivers  they provide.  In some cases, the agency will  employ their own caregivers, providing  bonding and worker’s compensation  insurance. The agency should have  scheduling personnel available to help find  another caregiver to cover when your  regular caregiver is ill or on vacation.  Some  agencies have on-call staff available on  weekends or in the evening, should there be  an urgent need for a caregiver. Agencies  should also provide oversight to ensure that  the caregiver is meeting the unique needs of  the elder he or she is serving.
