    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                             January 2008    President’s Corner    I hope that all of you had a safe and enjoyable Holiday Season.  Your Homeowners Association is back in full force and  working for you and our community. We have our monthly  board meeting at the SHHA office the second Wednesday of  every month at 7 PM and you are welcome to attend.      This month I would like to take a few minutes of your time to  discuss our community and what makes it so very special.  The next time you walk out of your  home take a few minutes to look around and then listen for the sounds you hear.  Most in our  community will find an exceptional panorama and a quiet stillness that make Sandia Heights  very special. You have entrusted your homeowners association to maintain our community and,  through that, our property values. While our covenants are not all inclusive, and they certainly  vary some between units, they do offer our basis for maintaining our community.     I just had a new garage built and I, too, went through the process set out in our covenants and  the guidelines.  While it did take 30 days to get through the ACC, it was approved and under  construction shortly thereafter. That included a neighborhood review, where my neighbors got a  chance to review the plans and comment on our proposed construction. Ideally, I would have  just contacted a builder and put up what I wanted--but--maintaining that panorama for all in the  community is very important. The only way to do that is to make sure that when each of us  makes changes on the outside of our homes or land that it goes through a review process. I have  an obligation to my neighbors to make sure that I do not interfere with their enjoyment of this  wonderful community.      This same concept applies to the quiet nature of our community. It takes all of us understanding  that we can maintain what we all enjoy through cooperative effort. Does your neighbor’s dog  bark excessively? Maybe they are looking at the pile of scrap wood in your side yard or the RV  stored in your driveway. Does your neighbor's tree block your view of Mount Taylor?  Maybe  your poorly built and non-approved shed is all they see when they look toward the Sandia Peak.   We get plenty of complaints and try our best to sort them all out--seldom to the satisfaction of  all parties. However, the real test in maintaining this community is each of us looking at our  property through our neighbor’s eyes. What do you see and hear when you look at your  property? I would ask each of you to assess how you have contributed to making this a better  community and helped everyone enjoy the beautiful panoramas and quiet nature of Sandia  Heights. Are you being a good neighbor?

The  world’s longest  aerial tramway, an  attraction for visitors  from around the  world and located right in our own backyard, has  become a little more accessible to Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association members. Beginning  November 15, 2007, up to 4 round-trip Tram  Passes will be available for SHHA members, each  day, free of charge! (A $17.50 value for adults,  $15.00 for seniors, $10.00 for kids under 12, for a  total savings of up to $70.00 per day)    Here is how it works:  • First come, first served.  • Pick up your pass(es) at the SHHA office, 2B  San Rafael, and provide a deposit of $5.00 per  pass (check or cash).  • Turn in your used ticket stub(s) at the SHHA  office and receive a full refund of your deposit.   • Passes will be issued for a particular date and  may be used only for that date.  • Of course, passes are available only during days  and hours that the Tram is available to the public.  • Depending on demand, preference may be given  to first time Tram Pass users before repeat users.   • You must come into the office to reserve your  date.                    Letters to the editor         Everyday, these are the top stories in the news.  In the Albuquerque Journal, Saturday, November  3, 2007 the feature article was “Not Green  Enough.” According to the National Recycling  Coalition, recycling 1 aluminum can save enough  energy to power a TV for 3 hours and 5 plastic  soda bottles can yield enough fiber to make one  square foot of carpet or enough fill for a ski  jacket.”         I’m writing this letter because I am very  concerned. We, as Sandia Height’s members need  to take a more active stand. We need to have curb  side recycling, so that we can help salvage the  materials that can be recycled.  According to the  newspaper, NM has 1.9 million tons of waste that  we produce. It is a very simple process. We get a  recycling tub that we put newspapers, plastic, and  glass into it, and every week we put it on the curb  for the company that recycles to pick up. We may  have to pay a couple of dollars more for our water  and sewage but it’s worth it. We do not need to  transport our trash to a drop-off site and we are  actually making a difference.       We NEED to do our part in helping the planet  to become a better place. We need to push our  subdivision to be more conscious and more  politically correct to help REDUCE, REUSE, and  RECYCLE.      Sharon R. Mayo ~ resident            The Bernalillo County Animal Ordinance is  changing. Please attend the District 4 County  Commissioner’s Hearing, there is strength in  numbers and County Commissioners count  physical presence first, a letter second, and a phone  call a distant third. This hearing has not been  scheduled at the time writing, but www.bernco.gov  will post the meeting notice.  You can also get a  copy of the ordinance from the Bernalillo County  website.       It is my opinion that the proposed changes to  the Bernalillo County Animal Control Ordinance  are a vast improvement. The biggest remaining  problem is that the proposed Bernalillo Animal  Control Ordinance continues to allow dog chaining  (see sections 6-39 and 6-45). The City of  Albuquerque HEART ordinance limits the amount  of time a dog can be chained to 1 hour per day. The  proposed Bernalillo County ordinance has no  restrictions on the amount of time a dog can be  chained.        If we in District 4 do not voice our support for  the ordinance and express our desire for kinder  laws in regards to animal restraint we may not get  the provisions that protect us from the negative  impacts associated with irresponsible pet owners.  Remember the County ordinance applies to south  valley, north valley, east mountains, and far NE  heights. We have a small population, so we need to  be loud to combat the voices that support cruelty.

Saturday January 26, 2008 –   SHHA Office Open House    Come join us for a MEET 'N GREET   on Saturday, January 26th, 11 am to  3 pm, at our SHHA office, 2B  San  Rafael Avenue     We'll be serving Hors d'oeuvres and beverages. All Sandia  Heights residents are invited to meet our SHHA office staff  and volunteer Directors, and committee members.   New members and non-members – come on out, join   with association members and discover the many   resources of your Homeowners Association.      Hosted by the SHHA Community Service   and Membership Committee.  The GRIT, Jan 2008                                                                                                                    Page 7    Parks & Safety Committee ~   Frances Desonier    As most of you know, a survey was sent out last  year regarding numerous issues including some  regarding the trimming of vegetation along the  roadside that borders each homeowner’s property.  One question asked whether the homeowner  currently took responsibility for trimming such  vegetation. Results: 240 of you answered, “Yes,”  and 40 answered, “No.”  In addition, 17  homeowners included comments about their  answer.  Of those answering, “No,” 6 indicated  that they did not believe there was vegetation  requiring cutting and 2 indicated that they were  not physically able to do the job.  A few  homeowners who answered “Yes” were  concerned that others in their vicinity did not.    A second question referred to the county’s  providing such maintenance.  The question was  stated thus: “Do you prefer to leave the trimming  to County Road Maintenance?” Results: 187 of  you answered, “Yes,” and 170 answered “No,”  with 50 of you providing comments in addition to  your answers.  The greatest number of responses  (16) had to do with complaints regarding  overgrown vegetation along roadsides. Three  comments indicated that the homeowners were  not pleased with the way the County cuts the  vegetation.  Another 3 complained that the  trimming did not occur often enough. Three more  indicated that trimming of “common areas” not  private property, is what is needed.  It seems most  homeowners would be happier if ALL  homeowners would trim their own vegetation  along roadsides.    The Parks and Safety Committee wishes to inform  all SHHA residents that there is a County law that  requires the homeowner to trim the vegetation  along the road.  The law also allows the County to  “bill” the homeowner if they have to trim the  vegetation.  Since overgrown vegetation is a  safety hazard, the Parks and Safety Committee  will continue to work with the County to  coordinate a “courtesy mowing project” to keep  the edge of the roads trimmed of vegetation to  allow for safe driver and pedestrian visibility.   These mowing projects will probably occur no  more often than once every 6 months, so  homeowners are encouraged to continue to trim  along their own roadside as needed.  Most likely  this committee and the County will not proceed  with the “courtesy mowing project” as long as our  roads provide safe driver and pedestrian visibility.    Bernalillo County Fire & Rescue  Paramedic Response to Sandia Heights  ~ Sy Caudill, SHHA President    As most of you know, Station 5 on Paseo Del  Norte normally responds to Sandia Heights in the  case of a medical emergency. We heard a rumor  that the paramedic truck was being pulled from  the station. As part of our ongoing effort to insure  a safe and secure neighborhood, your Volunteer  organization initiated an immediate response.  Numerous calls finally led to Operations Chief  John Garcia, Bernalillo County Fire & Rescue  (BCF&R), who provided a clarification of the  issue. Chief Garcia can be reached at 761-4225.     He explained that staffing at the station only  allowed for one paramedic to staff the truck, and  that was not an acceptable situation in providing  emergency response. At least two paramedics are  required.  He elected to reassign that truck and  transfer emergency medical response  responsibility to Engine #5 at the station. In this  manner he could properly staff the responding  vehicle and assure that Sandia Heights and  surrounding areas would continue to receive  effective and timely response to medical  emergencies.     Operations Chief Garcia assures us that the  capability of our local station has not changed and  that the responding unit will be fully staffed with  qualified personnel and supporting equipment,  along with a move-up plan from neighboring  County and City fire stations. Bottom line, the  same great service from our friends with BCF&R  continues.     I hope this assuages any concerns that you may  have if you heard the rumor of changes at Station  5. This article has been reviewed and approved by  Operations Chief Garcia, who by the time you  read this, will have met with your Volunteer  Board of Directors to answer any questions on this  issue.

If you are interested in joining the group (age range is 40s to 80s), please call  Marsha Thole (856-3352) to be placed on the membership list. If you tried to contact the SOSH  coordinator in the past two months, she has been experiencing "technical problems" as they say, with  her answering machine, so your call may have been lost to the nether world. In addition, if you called  and left a message, if you did leave your phone number, then she could not call you back.  So, it isn't  because we don't want any new members, just blame it on "pilot error."       SOSH is looking forward to 2008 with great anticipation of some great activities and fun things to  do. So don't miss out on what could be some interesting adventures in the new year. If you haven't  joined us yet, then you have missed out on the following from this past year: cooking classes at Le Cafe  Miche, trips to numerous concerts in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, tea, Santa Fe Opera, July 4 celebration  picnic, Memorial Day events, movies, chile supper, Isotopes game, BB King farewell concert, and  much, much, more. If you are sitting home, you are missing out on some great fun and great company.  So, why not pick up that phone and call Marsha at 856-3352. If you don't hear from her, call the office  to find out if she is dead from over celebrating the new year!
