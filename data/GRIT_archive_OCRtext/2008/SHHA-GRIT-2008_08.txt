  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                     Aug 2008    President’s Message by Sy Caudill    Well it's summer and a lot is going on in Sandia Heights. Those of you living in the Live Oak area  have been dealing with paving of one of our main streets. There is paving going on in other areas,  and we continue to work with the county to identify streets that need paving and with our  representatives to let them know that funds are needed for street improvements. While funds are  limited, we have been very successful in getting roads repaved and we will continue to work this  issue. Speaking of roads, this brings up speed bumps (traffic calmers) and posted speed limits. We  have had comments from both members and non-members on this issue. Let me clearly state that  SHHA does not and will not take a position on speed bumps. That is an issue where the county has  a process and procedure in place allowing residents on a given street to address the issue. We will  continue to leave it to the county to implement their process. In the area of speed limits we have  been working with the county through our Parks and Safety Committee to determine appropriate  speed limits on our roads. Some have them posted, some don’t. My street does not have a sign and  the 'acceptable' speed seems to range from 15 to 45mph. You will find an article on this by the  Chair of Parks and Safety elsewhere in this issue. On these two subjects there seems to be a  perception that our Parks and Safety Committee is 'packed' with either pro-bumpers or anti- bumpers. I can assure you that I cannot tell you the position of a single member of this committee.  I have been and will continue to ask for your support in volunteering for this organization.  Members may serve on any committee or on the board; we do ask that members not be 'single  issue' volunteers and that they keep an open mind in discussions. If you want to influence how  SHHA is run--volunteer, we will welcome you.    On the subject of members and non-members, just because you are reading this does not mean you  are a member. We send the GRIT to all addresses in the community as a public service. However,  like all organizations, membership has its privileges. Members are welcome to attend any and all  meetings of the Board or Committees, they have access to free Tram Passes, free admission to our  Coffee House series, free ACC requests, action from the Covenant Support Committee for  member-reported violations, free copy service (for limited copies), free notary service, access to  our contractors’ reference database and a myriad of other benefits. Like any organization we are  supported by our members and in return we will continue to find ways to make membership have  its benefits. On the flip side, we do not provide these services to non-members, with the exception  of the Coffee House where non-members can attend for a fee. So even though we provide the  GRIT to all, we would ask that you understand this is a membership organization and we will  continue to monitor these activities and services to ensure that only members receive the  benefits. We are seeking more ways that we can provide benefits to our members and we welcome  suggestions. As always, if you are a member and have suggestions or comments on the SHHA  please email us at shha@sandiahomeowners.org or call the office.    The GRIT, Aug 2008                                                                                                            Page 2  Parks and Safety Committee ~  Frances Desonier       Hello, Neighbors: There has been a bit of a  controversy generated recently by a few of  our neighbors who are under the impression  that our Parks and Safety Committee is  diligently working toward increasing the  speed limit on San Rafael and removing the  current speed humps. One of the projects our  committee is doing is continuing to work  closely with the county as it determines  whether the speed humps that have been  installed have in fact made our community  safer.       We have heard from a number of  neighbors on this issue, some who are  convinced that we must not allow the  current speed limit to be raised and who  believe the speed humps provide a safer  environment for our neighborhood; and  others, who are equally convinced that the  current speed limit of 15 miles per hour is  oppressive and that speed humps are  dangerous on emergency feeder routes.  There are good arguments on both sides.     The county has been very responsive to  our neighborhood association and is  working diligently to determine what a safe  speed is on our roads via scientific studies  and what is the best method of reducing  speeds on our roads in ways that are not  dangerous for those in true crisis, such as  health or fire emergencies. SHHA and our  Parks & Safety Committee have no part in  the ultimate decision made by the county.  The County is simply keeping us informed  of its progress.     By the time you read this article in our  next GRIT, the Parks & Safety Committee  will have met at least twice, once to clarify  our objectives for this current year, and a  second meeting with David Mitchell and  Robert Baker, our county contacts, to  discuss the results of their most recent traffic  studies completed in July 2008 and plans  they have for the future.  These will be  reported on in a future GRIT. They have  also assured us that prior to any major  changes, a town hall meeting would be held  to discuss the proposed changes with all  interested parties. We would publicize such  a meeting via our GRIT, should that even be  necessary.     I hope you all have a wonderful summer  enjoying our very special neighborhood.                   San Rafael  Construction    ~ Sy Caudill    As those of you  traversing San  Rafael know, we  have construction  occurring next to our office. We have  received complaints on two areas. First is  the visibility when exiting the parking  lot. Second is the issue of no walkway on  the south side of San Rafael due to the  construction fence. This has been addressed  with the property owner and a partial  solution has been found. The fence has wind  blockers on it which will be removed to  allow improved visibility when exiting the  parking lot.     On the second issue the construction crew  will be digging and trenching not only on  the lot but into San Rafael as well for  utilities connections. The fence must enclose  this area and therefore it goes to the edge of  the street. In fact a temporary partial  blockage of the street will occur when street  connections are made. For safety the  construction area will remain fenced. We  encourage walkers to be aware of the  construction and how the fence may  temporarily impair walking in this area.                The GRIT, Aug 2008                                                                                                              Page 3  June 2008 Treasurer’s Report ~ Ed Tull, Treasurer            CASH FLOW    ACCOUNT BALANCES      Bank Accounts  INFLOWS    CD #2  $36,643.16 ACC income  $75.00   CD #3  $15,310.64 Directory Sales  $5.00   CD #4  $103,050.19 GRIT Advertising  $740.68   Money Market   $12,886.76 Membership Dues  $13,094.27   Checking  $736.26 TOTAL INFLOWS  $13,914.95   Cash Accounts  $1,338.61     Total Bank & Cash  $169,965.62 OUTFLOWS      ACC  $7.35   ASSET ACCOUNTS  Community Service &  Membership  $491.09   Miscellaneous  $1,379.21 Communications and  Publications  $996.90   Office Equipment  $4,973.06 Executive Committee  $150.00   Office Furniture  $5,651.99 Insurance  $233.89   Software  $932.34 Office Expense  $7,279.08   TOTAL Asset  Accounts  $12,936.60       TOTAL OUTFLOWS  $9,158.31   Liability Accounts      Improvements & Legal  Reserve  $146,592.00 OVERALL TOTAL  $4,756.64         OVERALL TOTAL  $36,310.22             Don't miss the next Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert on Saturday, September 13,  at Church of the Good Shepherd--a special performance by internationally-known Robin and  Linda Williams and Their Fine Group (robinandlinda.com).

Statistics compiled by the   Sandia Heights Security Patrol       The statistics that you see published in the GRIT are compiled  monthly by the Security patrol. When a call comes in to the  patrol it is logged by name, address or phone number of the  caller (name, address and phone are kept confidential). The call  is entered into the database and assigned a code, e.g., “VAN” for  vandalism, “AL” for alarms, etc. A monthly query is run at the  end of each month; the coded calls are tallied and generate the  statistics that you see in the GRIT. The database is then “cleaned  out.” The last month’s calls are deleted along with any duplicate  entries for any given address. The reports are faxed to the  SHHA. We also report the month’s calls to the BCSO (Bernalillo  County Sheriff Office) along with any other more specific  information they might want that we might have. Hard copies are  also kept of each month’s calls.

Birds help keep the bugs down. A dish or pail  of water in your garden will attract birds.   Keep suckers from growing. Remove suckers from the base of trees or bushes.  Also cut off  suckers from low hanging limbs. This accomplishes the same thing as deadheading.   By deadheading and removing suckers, you are sending the nutrients to the rest of the plant.

We do count “calls” that are not called in to  us. If an officer notices a mailbox knocked  over, for instance, and either the resident is  not a subscriber to the service, or does not  call the incident in, these are also entered  and compiled as calls.    * Note: It is important for residents to impart  as much information to the patrol as  possible, especially with respect to  suspicious vehicles (type, color, make &  model, license number) and persons (male  or female, height, weight, clothing,  approximate age and ethnicity). These are of  particular interest to the BCSO when we  make our reports to them.                    ACC Activity Log   The following is a summary of your  Architectural Control Committee’s  activity since the last GRIT.      1 Juniper Hill Road – Refinish doors & trim,  repair fence.
