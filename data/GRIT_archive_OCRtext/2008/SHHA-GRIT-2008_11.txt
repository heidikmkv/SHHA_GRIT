  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                                     Nov 2008  www:sandiahomeowners.org  HAPPY THANKSGIVING!    President’s Message   ~ Sy Caudill    21 Inches of Snow fall in   Sandia Heights!         Well not yet-- but while I've got your  attention let's discuss fall in our great  community. If you are lucky you can see  the Aspens changing color up on the  mountain and a bit later the trees in the  valley will be changing--which many of  you can, I hope, see from your homes.   Yes fall is a great time of year and our  community is an exceptional place to live  and enjoy the wonderful community that  we all love. However, one continuing  issue that frequently comes up in my  discussions with members is the issue of  views and blocked views.       As our ACC Chair has pointed out in  earlier articles, this community once  looked a great deal like the virgin land that  lays just to our north on the Sandia  Reservation. The next time you drive north  on Tramway take a look as you pass the  last stop sign and notice how far you can  see and how wonderful the views are from  the road. Once Sandia Heights had the  same views from most of the lots. So what  happened? Well some of it has to do with  the homes but generally the developers  established setbacks and view corridors  that would maintain the views for all.        So what else has resulted in the  complaints that I hear frequently? It is the  trees that have been planted over the years  that are not native to the community--they  are now reaching mature heights of 30-40  feet and more. We have evergreens,  ponderosa pines, leafy trees that grow  straight up, willows and the ever present  Chinese Elms. Am I advocating doing  clear cutting to restore the  lost\disappearing views--no I'm not. What  I'm asking each of you to do is take a look  at your lot from the perspective of your  neighbors--take a walk or drive and look at  how your landscaping has impacted your  fellow residents and how does your  landscaping impact their ability to also  enjoy the natural beauty of the  neighborhood? I wouldn't ask any of you  to do something that I have not done and  that consists of considering having your  tall trees trimmed\topped\removed.            Last year I had a professional tree  service trim the biggest tree in my yard to  the height of my home--not because any of  my neighbors asked me to--just because it  was the right thing to do. In many cases  most of the trees add little to your  enjoyment as a 40 foot tall tree adds little  more than a 20 foot tree--well except  maybe for the extra 16 bags of leaves that  you have to clean up every fall. Would  you like it if the neighbor below you  topped their trees? Well just maybe the  neighbor above you feels the same way  about your trees. Each of us can make  living in this great neighborhood more  enjoyable if we are considerate of others  and do what we can to improve the  neighborhood for all. Enjoy the great fall  weather and the snow that we all hope will  eventually fall in Sandia Heights.  The GRIT, Nov 2008                                                                                                            Page 2  Disaster Preparedness and  Fire Info ~ Alyson Clark         Title: At our August 23rd Meet and Greet  a Fire Marshal from the Bernalillo County  Fire Dept. spoke about planning for  emergencies. I will paraphrase some of the  highlights plus add additional information  from their web page, bernco.gov.        When you call 911 from your landline  telephone, the county gets a screen display  with your name, address and phone number  of record from the phone company. If you  have completed a CARE Form (obtained  from the web page and can include special  medical instructions or particulars on  directions to your home) then that info  displays, too, along with a map and GPS  coordinates. It does not have an On-Star  type device.       You are welcome to personally call 911  to verify what information they have in your   file.        If your street has a curbside, you may  want to have reflective address numbers  painted on it. They should be 4 inches in  height. If necessary, clear vegetation from  your driveway so that it is at least 12 feet  wide for emergency response vehicles.  Incidentally, chamisa is highly flammable.        In addition to the standard A,B,C fire  extinguisher and smoke detectors, you  should consider having a carbon monoxide  (CO) detector because gas-burning furnaces  & water heaters, wood-burning stoves &  fireplaces, autos and gas-powered  equipment can produce CO. Fire  extinguishers, smoke detectors and CO  detectors are not expensive and are available  at home-improvement type stores.       I also keep several gallons of water,  canned food items, a flashlight, extra  batteries, a hand-crank radio and a first aid  kit which has hand sanitizer, gloves and  masks.      Communications &  Publications ~ Frances Desonier         ATTENTION all Homeowners!   SHHA  wants to encourage more of our  homeowners to browse our website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org. To this end  our Communications and Publications  Committee is asking for interested  homeowners to submit pictures of general  interest (travel, balloon fiesta, gardening,  hobby, etc.) to be used in the SHHA website  photo gallery.  This is a great way to share  your unique experiences with your  neighbors!         Just bring in your camera chip and reader  to the SHHA office and Sheraz or Betsy will  download the photos for you. We just want  your images straight from your camera, so  that we have them at the same resolution as  recorded by your camera.         So review your digital photo files for  images you would like presented in a photo  gallery format. We will all benefit from your  experiences and praise you for your skill at  photography!  Hope to see your images soon  in the SHHA website photo gallery.        Letters to the Editor is a feature where we  provide a means of presenting relevant and  topical issues\opinions within the  community. However, we reserve the right  to limit based on space and relevancy.   When a topic has been fully explored,  discussed and a decision made we will  consider it no longer relevant and will cease  publication of letters on that issue. Also,  letters must be free of personal attacks, they  must center just on the topic at hand. We  encourage civil discourse on issues within  the community and will continue to publish  relevant letters.  ~ The Editors    The GRIT, Nov 2008                                                                                                              Page 3  September 2008 Treasurer’s Report ~ Ed Tull, Treasurer            CASH FLOW    ACCOUNT BALANCES      Bank Accounts  INFLOWS    CD #2  $37,042.21 ACC income  $50.00   CD #3  $15,364.33 Tram Pass Deposits  $790.00   CD #4  $103,845.77 Directory & GRIT  Advertising  $12,495.22   Money Market   $6,902.57 Membership Dues  $13,146.57   Checking  $13,400.98 Safety Vests  $28.00   Cash Accounts  $2,231.74 NM Gross Receipts  Tax  $726.29   Total Bank & Cash  $178,787.60 TOTAL INFLOWS  $27,236.08           OUTFLOWS      ACC  $7.48   ASSET ACCOUNTS  Bylaws  $12.83   Miscellaneous  $1,379.21 Community Service &  Membership  $2.120.72   Office Equipment  $4,973.06 Communications &  Publications  $1,684.04   Office Furniture  $5,651.99 Executive Committee  $373.62   Software  $932.34 Insurance  $3,895.00   TOTAL Asset  Accounts  $12,936.60 Office Expense  $9,249.26,     TOTAL OUTFLOWS  $17,342.95   Liability Accounts      Improvements & Legal  Reserve  $146,592.00 OVERALL TOTAL  $9,893.13   OVERALL TOTAL  $45,132.20       ANNOUNCEMENTS & NOTICES:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.
