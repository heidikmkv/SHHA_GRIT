    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                                March 2008    President’s Corner      In earlier articles I have asked for your opinions and inputs on what  areas need to be a focus for your association. Recently we had our first  Open House at the office on a Saturday. Thank you to everyone who  participated in making it a resounding successful event. We had a steady  flow of residents and they had the chance to talk to our office staff as well as many members of the  Board of Directors. We even had a resident sign up to become a member. This event gave me a  chance to discuss with many of you what was important to you and how the SHHA can be of added  value. This face to face meeting is very valuable and adds immensely to our understanding of what  the community holds as priorities. What emerged, in my view, was a clear statement that members  want the Architectural Control Committee, the Covenant Support Committee, as well as the Board  to ensure that we continue to enforce our covenants. This has been and always will be a priority for  the SHHA. In so doing, there will always be give and take in the interpretation and application of  the covenants and guidelines. However, these have been refined over many years of application and,  unfortunately, several court cases which have been settled in favor of the association. If you have  questions about when you must submit an application (if the project is on the outside it is almost  always required) you can review most of the information on our website or call the office for  additional guidance. Speaking of the website—it has a new look and is more user friendly. We are  working to improve it and encourage you to give us your inputs on what you would like to see on  the site and how we can better serve you through the site.       Also, in my discussions with members it became apparent that many are concerned about safety  on our roads. In general, the speed limits in Sandia Heights are either 15 or 25 MPH, which in many  cases are being violated on a regular basis. When I’m out I’m almost always stopped by pedestrians  and asked what can we do about the speeding? We have a lot of walkers, runners, children, bikers  and others on our streets—needless to say—cars and pedestrians can be a real hazard. Now I’m  going say something that will get everyone’s attention—speed bumps—there it is said and done.    These are installed by the county under a county process\procedure and not by the SHHA. Why do  we have them? Back to my first couple of sentences—speeding and pedestrians. It is that simple.   On the driver’s side of the issue, I’m asked why do pedestrians walk 2-3 wide? Why do they walk at  night in dark clothes? Why do I see baby strollers, a walker and a dog on a leash in the middle of  the street? If I knew these answers, well, I might have a best selling book. All I do know is that the  answer to most of our most contentious issues is tolerance and patience and working with our  neighbors. I can say this, when in your car no matter how important getting to your destination is; it  is not worth the injury that you could deliver to a pedestrian that was out walking on the road. So I  would ask all our drivers to please slow down, just as I would ask all our walkers to be considerate  and step aside to let the cars pass and make sure you are visible when on the streets. We can each  try and make this community a safer and better place to live—by working together to improve our  community.

HOW do we keep this 600 acre treasure? Through the non-profit Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA) staff and resident volunteers we maintain our investments and the character  of our 42 subdivisions.    WHEN? Now. You probably already know that the slate for the June election of the SHHA  Board is being drafted now. There are approximately 5,200 of us living here. And to serve all the  requests in the community it takes only 25 or more people willing to give a small amount of  time.

The GRIT, March 2008                                                                                                                    Page 3  COMMON AREAS ~ Jim Irving    Many residents have asked us about  common area responsibilities within Sandia  Heights. The most common description areas  are things like swimming pools, tennis courts,  etc., that are owned and operated by  homeowners associations. There are no such  areas within Sandia Heights. (Refer to the  section of this article defining New Mexico  laws re common areas.) The Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA) has incurred  significant legal expense trying to identify  responsibilities for areas that some consider  "Common." This topic began with questions  about damaged walls, and who was responsible  for the repair of the same when needed. Our  attorney looked into this and advised that, in  general, the responsibility for repair lay with  the individual homeowner, or in a few cases,  with the County. There are some units of  Sandia Heights wherein those units have  assumed responsibility for certain areas. (See  the section below entitled "Unit Covenants.")  New Mexico Laws re Common Areas: The  only state statutes that mention common areas  are:  NM Statute 47-7-l that deals with  Condominiums and NM Statute 47-10-1 that  deals with Mobile Home Parks. No statute  deals with homeowners associations such as the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  (SHHA). However, we can get a clue from the  Building Unit Ownership Act which defines  common areas at "Property in common use or  convenient to its existence, maintenance or  safety."  By Amendment to the SHHA Articles of  Incorporation dated 6/27/84, such Amendment  provides, in part, that one of the purposes of the  Corporation is to "perform certain maintenance  and care for the common areas of the  development." It does not define what common  areas are, nor does it create common areas. It  merely gives SHHA power to create such areas.  One of the places to look for possible  common areas is the unit covenants themselves.   There are 31 units, each with its own set of  covenants.  Some units have their own  homeowners associations (HOA), and units 21,  24 and 26 require mandatory membership in  their respective HOAs. Unit 26 has assigned its  respective duties and responsibilities to SHHA.  The covenants of Unit 21 provide that the  individual property owners are responsible for  the maintenance of any common areas/setback  on or adjoining their respective lots. In fact,  their covenants cover specific lots as being  responsible for certain areas, including  extension of lot lines to the base of retaining  walls, and for plantings in the setback area  between owner's property and the street.   Unit 24 covenants provide that the HOA of  this unit is responsible for weed control, etc., in  the rights of way of Tramway Terrace Court.    The covenants of units 25, 27A, B, & C and  28A, B & C provide that the property owners  are responsible for easement areas within their  property.  Bernalillo County Code Section 66-225  states the individual property owners are  responsible for plantings in the setback area  between the owner's property and the street. If  the plantings (primarily chamisa) extend into  the street to the extent they block visibility and  create a hazard the county has the right to trim  the plantings three feet into the setback  property.  There are really very few common areas in  Sandia Heights. Although we all use the parks,  they are the responsibility of the County, as is  the upkeep of the streets.  One of our attorneys has recommended that  we treat signs describing various individual  units as common areas, and, therefore, the  responsibility of SHHA, however, the costs  would be assessed to the individual property  owners of that particular unit which, in all  practicality, almost negates the common area  responsibility by shifting those costs to a  particular unit. The SHHA Board of Directors  currently passed a resolution that the SHHA  will provide limited financial assistance in the  repair/replacement of descriptive unit signs.  SHHA has the power to designate certain  areas as common areas pursuant to the  amended Articles of Incorporation, but has not  done so.

They were able to discover the leak by  noting that their last water bill was out of  line with normal usage. They also know of  another neighbor near them that had also  experienced similar problems. They  attributed the leak to cold temperatures and no snow  blankets. Please use the monthly water bill as the monitor for  any issues that may be happening with your plumbing and  irrigation systems on a year round basis. If you notice  something out of the ordinary Sandia Heights Services is  more than happy to check meter readings and movement on  a customer’s meter as part of their services.

RECYCLING  UPDATE ~ Alyson Clark     Many of our readers have inquired about  recycling in the Northeast Heights. Although  we do not yet have curbside recycling in  Sandia Heights, we do have convenient drop  off centers within 5 miles of us. These are  giant trash bins located in the parking lots of  the Wyoming @ Paseo del Norte Smith's, the  Smith's at Tramway and Montgomery, the  ABQ Convenience Center aka the dump at  6301 Eagle Rock NE, the Assembly of God  church on the north west corner of  Montgomery and Wyoming and JoAnn's  Fabrics on Wyoming @ Menaul. Since these  bins are in public places, they are always  accessible. Recycle glass, paper (including  cardboard, magazines, and newspaper) tin,  aluminum and plastic (bottles and bags.) It is  worth your time and effort to be  environmentally conscientious.

Dear Editor,  As a resident of Sandia Heights and a member  of the SHHA I need to report two instances of  vandalism which I think have most likely gone  unnoticed. I work as a real estate broker for  NAI The Vaughan Company. One of my  clients is the owner of the vacant 10.4 acre lot  on the eastside of Tramway at the intersection  of Tramway and Paseo Del Norte. We have had  two FOR SALE signs stolen in the past five  weeks. Together both signs cost well over  $600.00. We have informed both the Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s office as well as Sandia  Heights Security patrol and they have informed  us that once we post yet another sign they will  take notice. Any information that can be  provided which may lead to the person or  persons responsible for these thefts would be  greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help  with this unnecessary vandalism. Feel free to  contact the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s office  as well as Sandia Heights Security.    Sincerely,  David L. Fox    SHHA is always concerned when it comes to  vandalism in our community. Please be vigilant  and report to the proper authorities any  information you may have on such incidents.                 The Bernalillo County Animal Ordinance is  changing.

A copy of  the proposed changes to the ordinance can be  found at:  http://www.bernco.gov//upload/images/animal_ care/ordinace_propose51407.pdf. Contact Tim  Cummins (your District 4 County  Commissioner) emckinley@bernco.gov and  Becky Darrow, Acting Manager, Animal Care  and Regulations (bdarrow@bernco.gov) if you  have comments on the proposed County  ordinance changes.    If we in District 4 do not voice our support for  the proposed ordinance changes and express  our desire for these further improvements, we  may not get the provisions that protect us from  the negative impacts associated with  irresponsible pet owners. Remember the  County ordinance applies to south valley,  north valley, east mountains, and far NE  heights.  Responsible people tend to be quiet;  let’s not let the voices that support cruelty and  populate the animal shelters with unwanted  animals be the loudest.
