  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                         December 2008    President’s Corner    Holidays and Your Association       By the time you read this we will be in the  Holiday Season and all of us at the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association hope you  have had a very good year and are looking  forward to 2009.  This year has been a good  one for SHHA; we have implemented many  benefits for our members and have been  engaged in everything from zoning to  resurfacing of Tramway Blvd and some  resurfacing within Sandia Heights. We have  seen a significant increase in the number of  applications for renovations and  improvements come through the ACC. In  addition, we have seen more community  involvement and attention in the area of  covenant enforcement. The Tram passes have  been well received, as have our open houses  with speakers on fire prevention and solar  power (thanks Ken for a great presentation on  this topic). I can report that our finances are in  good shape and we have two super part-time  workers in our front office--thanks Sheraz and  Betsy! If you have not been by the office, stop  in and let them explain the benefits of being a  member of SHHA.       Also this year, we have initiated a  recognition program for those who have  contributed the most to the Association.   Recognized this year were Kerney Bolton, Ed  Whitten, Sheraz Saint-Lot, Bob Frances, Lena  Martinez and Terry Taggart--again our thanks  for your work on the part of SHHA.       Speaking of volunteers--I get phone calls  and emails on a fairly frequent basis  concerning everything from paving to views,  trees, zoning, the ACC and CSC, and roadside  brush.  The association is involved to some  extent in all of these, but our resources are  limited, especially in the area of  people. While we would like to meet all  members’ expectations on your particular  area(s) of concern, we just do not have the  volunteers to do many of things that need to  be accomplished. For example, the ACC has  handled over 500 projects so far this year  alone. Each project requires an initial review  of the submission, a visit to the site, research  of the covenants, development of a  recommendation, presentation to the  committee, notification of the results to the  homeowner and follow-up on completion of  the project. As you can see this takes a great  deal of time and energy.        While the Covenant Support Committee  has a less detailed process, it is  normally dealing with a violation of our  covenants, and that can result in detailed  discussions with all involved. My point is that  everything we do, except running the office,  depends on your willingness to contribute  your time and energy. In the calls that I  receive most of you want us to do more about  a particular issue. We can't without your help  and involvement. So while I wish I could tell  everyone who calls "We will get right on  that," it just won't happen unless you help out.       How can you help? Volunteer as a  member of the Board of Directors; we  currently have 5 open positions. Volunteer to  sit on a committee where you have an interest,  they will welcome you. Right now we have  fewer than 25 people as board members and  volunteers doing all of the work of YOUR  association. Make a commitment to become  involved and give us a call at the office.              Happy Holidays to all our members.

Unfortunately, the Sandia  Heights housing community is not laid out  with paved pedestrian foot streets. Our  community features large lots and winding  2- lane country style roads, but no trails or  paved pedestrian sidewalks. In contrast our  neighbor immediately south of us, High  Desert housing community, has small lots  and straight roads, some of which are four  lanes, and ample paved sidewalks. In  addition, they have road space set aside for  bicycle traffic. To illustrate the above  comments, I have included two photos.      FIGURE 1:  TYPICAL EAST-WEST  ROADWAY IN SANDIA HEIGHTS              The first figure shows a typical east-west  Sandia Heights vehicular roadway. One  notes the road is two lanes and has no  concrete curbs. Also, shrubbery and high  grass are on each side of the road. There is  no paved or unpaved sidewalk for pedestrian  traffic. The posted speed limit is 15 miles  per hour.            Figure 2 is a photo of a typical east-west  4-lane roadway in the High Desert home  community. One notes the concrete curb, the  space allocated for bicycles, and the paved  sidewalk for pedestrians. The speed limit is  35 miles per hour.    FIGURE 2:  TYPICAL EAST-WEST  ROADWAY IN HIGH DESERT HOME  COMMUNITY         I prefer the large lots and winding  country roads found in Sandia Heights.  I  also enjoy jogging and frequently jog on  Sandia Heights roadways. The reality is that  many homeowner residents also walk, jog or  bicycle on our roadways too. The issue then  becomes one of safety. Even an automobile  traveling at 5 mph is no match for a  pedestrian; the pedestrian looses. A  pedestrian and motor vehicle are competing  for the same space, and that requires  vigilance and courtesy on the part of the  pedestrian and the automobile driver.  For  accident avoidance, both the walker and  driver must see each other in time to take  evasive action.          There is a pedestrian pathway located on  Tramway Blvd that is over three miles long  and runs adjacent to Sandia Heights.

For details on how  the tram passes work please check the  website.      Just a note of clarification, we mail the GRIT  to both members and non members as a  courtesy to the few in Sandia Heights who  are non members to encourage them to join.  However, the services and benefits of  membership are limited to members of the  association. If you are a non-member we  encourage you to join.  The GRIT, Dec 2008                                                                                                               Page 7  Continued from page 3         Immediately south and east is the Elena  Gallegos Park, with over 60 miles of foot  paths. However, for those Sandia  homeowners who do use our roadways on  foot, the SHHA strongly recommends that  they wear a reflective safety vest. These  vests can be purchased at the SHHA office  located at San Rafael and Tramway.       Note:  The Parks & Safety Committee  will be working with the County in coming  months to ensure that all of our streets are  clear of obstructions that would prevent a  pedestrian from stepping off a street and out  of the way of oncoming vehicles. But there  is no need to wait for government assistance.   There is already a county law that specifies  that it is the homeowner’s responsibility to  maintain the first two to three feet of their  property that is considered easement. The  committee, therefore, asks that all SHHA  homeowners clear at least two feet of space  between the edge of the road and any  obstruction and vegetation that would not  allow a walker to safely step off the road in  order to avoid a dangerous situation. If you  would like to volunteer on the Parks &  Safety Committee, please contact the SHHA  office.    Sandia Heights Coffeehouse  Concert Series Presents . . .

You may take it to  the Eagle Rock Landfill Transfer station (857-8318) where the city  mulches it, or you can just put it out with your regular trash, but the  trees must be cut in half if taller than 6 feet.     DIAL BACK THE COFFEE   ~ Bob Francis, Happy Gardner    I mentioned in the spring of 2008 that I was adding coffee grounds to my  flower beds. The results of this experiment have not been good. Like so  many things, I found that too much coffee grounds is not a good thing. I suggest that if you  are going to use coffee grounds in your flower beds, do it sparingly.      I also want to report a root rot problem with my Penstemon. I noticed in the spring of 2008  that some of our Penstemon was dying. The bad spots are black blotches in the older  Penstemon areas. There was not much improvement in the summer, and in October the rot  got worse. I sent a sample of the rotting Penstemon to the State of New Mexico Agriculture  Extension Service. Their analysis indicated Fusarium wilt/root rot. The pathogen is soil  borne and can survive in the soil for many years. Poor fertility, low soil pH and over  watering and low light can predispose the plant to infection. The solution offered by the NM  Extension Service is to use Nitrate nitrogen rather than ammoniac nitrogen, and water  management.
