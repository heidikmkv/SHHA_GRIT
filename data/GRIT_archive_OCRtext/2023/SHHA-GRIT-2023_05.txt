She was born and raised in Albuquerque, and attended Sandia High  School. She is a proud mother of two sons and two grandchildren with a  third arriving in May. Family is the most important aspect of her life; she  loves to spend quality time playing with her grandchildren and cooking,  eating, visiting with family and friends. Trish looks forward to being a per- manent part of the SHHA team. If you have a chance, stop by the office  and say “Hello and welcome” to Trish.    Pay It Forward  Hugh Prather, Nominating Committee Chair    In the coming months, several Board of Director terms will expire. Those  positions need to be filled by new members who share the same dedica- tion and commitment to the Sandia Heights community as those complet- ing their service.   The perspectives new Board members bring to Board service is an en- ergizing and vital component of helping to keep the SHHA focused on  serving its members and its mission of maintaining the quality of life for  all residents in our community. Service as a member of the Board of Direc- tors “pays it forward” and helps assure that Sandia Heights ten years from  now will still retain the luster it holds today.  Board members must be property owners in Sandia Heights and belong  to the SHHA. The shifting demographics of our community with more  younger families with children becoming residents suggests the need for  more representation on the Board from that segment of our community.  However, anyone interested in “paying it forward” is welcome to apply.  Board service involves attending the monthly Board of Directors meet- ing—sometimes in person and sometimes virtually via Zoom—and service  on at least one committee. In aggregate, serving on the Board of Directors  typically requires a commitment of 3–5 hours a month. To apply for a term  on the Board simply contact Hugh Prather hugh.h.prather@gmail.com or  call (505) 321-1467 and a Statement of Interest will be sent and any ques- tions you have about aspects of Board service will be answered. We will  be holding a Question & Answer session via Zoom on May 18 to let inter- ested people know what’s involved with Board and committee service.  See page 12 for more details.    2   The GRIT – May 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 5    Wildfire Workshop—  Some of My Take Aways  Cheryl Wieker, Environment & Safety Committee    Two kinds of bushes regularly volunteer in my yard— both surviving without irrigation and with impressive  growth each year. After the SHHA’s Wildfire Workshop  at the end of March, I got serious about “ladder  fuels”—those plants that can take a wildfire from  grasses to bushes to the pinons and juniper trees. One  especially brittle bush that grows along the drip line of  the larger trees seems designed by nature to act as a  “fire improver.” Those had to go, so on the first day of  “Fire Weather,” I found myself fighting the wind to get  the weedy bushes out of the ground and onto the re- fuse pile. Luckily, they come out of the ground easily  with a few stomps and hits with a shovel, and it only  took an hour to rid those nasty fire-promoters from un- der my trees. I love my pinons and don’t want to lose  them...or my house!  Five other things I learned at the workshop:  • Preparing your home to survive a fast-moving wild- fire is not hard to do once you learn the risks. To  “harden” your home, clear a five-foot minimum pe- rimeter around the entire house. Don’t miss tree  limbs that are stretching toward the house. If you  have cleaned off your roof and there is nothing to  burn immediately next to your house, we learned  that there is a much better chance of saving your  home. Fifteen feet is better than five feet, but do  what you can. (See the “defensible space” distances  in the right column.)  • Embers can be blown onto your roof from miles  away. If the embers find fuel such as dead pine nee- dles or dry leaves, they can burn long enough to go  through your roofing and into the rafters. So, clean  off your roof each year before and during fire season.  • In the event of a wildfire, Bernalillo County has an  emergency alert system to notify residents. Sad sta- tistics reinforced the advice from the Chief of Emer- gency Management: “Don’t wait to evacuate.” Just  grab the kids, pets, your pre-prepared “go-bags” and  GO. Need a “go-bag” list? Check out the SHHA web- site (https://www.sandiahomeowners.org) under  the drop-down for Wildfire Preparedness, then Wild- fire Anticipation.  • For people using a landline phone, Bernalillo County’s  emergency dispatch system can notify Fire & Rescue  of special circumstances at your house (like oxygen  in use or residents with limited mobility). Register in  advance for the “CARE Program” by clicking on this  link to pre-register: https://www.bernco.gov/emer- gency-communications/special-response-instruc- tions-care/care-sign-up-english/ or call (505) 798- 7000.  • In case of a wildfire, firefighters need plentiful water  to stop the fire, so please do not run your hoses. Also,  lock your doors when you evacuate, and leave the  shades down and drapes closed. If you have time,  tape a note to the front door saying that you have  evacuated and can be reached at (your cell phone  number). If you have pets, mention that they have  evacuated with you.  Thanks to the speakers from the Bernalillo County  Emergency Services, Fire & Rescue, and Sandia Heights’  own Julie Rochman, former CEO of the Insurance Insti- tute for Business & Home Safety, and to the SHHA  Safety and Environment Committee for sponsoring the  workshop!

And in this case, the juniper is perfectly positioned for a fire  to jump to the wooden eaves!      3   The GRIT – May 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 5  Welcome to Each New Neighbor...   Every Month  Richard Bracket, Architectural Control Committee    When you purchase a home in Sandia Heights, you  agree to abide by the standards that are established for  your new community. Thirty-eight distinct sets of Cove- nants govern the various Units in Sandia Heights. The  covenants were created as environmental and visual  standards for the man-made structures and alterations  and significantly contribute to the unique beauty of San- dia Heights. To preserve these standards, all of us must  know our own Unit’s Covenants, also called Declara- tions of Restrictions.  I joined the Architectural Control Committee (ACC)  this year because the ACC was short-handed. I was  quickly assigned the responsibility of reviewing con- struction at three new neighbors’ homes. None of these  three owners were aware of the ACC, nor were they  aware of the Covenants in their Units! Construction was  underway on all three properties, without any approval  from the ACC to go forward with their construction.  Your Covenant guidelines—legal documents you  agreed to when you bought property in Sandia  Heights—describe the architectural limitations for your  Unit. These documents are part of the closing papers  you signed at the purchase of your property or house.  You must abide by them when you make any exterior  changes to your home or property.   The members of the Architectural Control Commit- tee are here to help and advise you with new construc- tion of any kind on your property. If you are planning  construction, call or come to the SHHA office (location  and hours on page 1) and ask for assistance. The office  staff will arrange for you to meet with an ACC member  either at your home or at the SHHA office. Our ACC vol- unteers will help you through the process of getting  your construction plans approved.  Keep in mind that the Architectural Control Commit- tee is here to help you. We will help you meet your con- struction goals, while complying with the requirements  of your Covenants. We are all volunteers! We are your  neighbors! Come and see us. We look forward to work- ing with you.    Woof! Woof! Is That YOUR Dog Barking?    Do you leave your dog outside alone? There are many  dogs in Sandia Heights who bark for hours when their  owners are away. Noise can echo off the foothills, espe- cially the noise of dogs with loud barks. Consider your  neighbors when you leave your dog out alone for hours  at a time. Their barking can be disturbing to those who  work at home, work night shifts and are trying to sleep,  may be ill, or don’t wish to listen to barking dogs while  they are relaxing at home. Most importantly…it is  against the law to allow your dogs to constantly bark!  According to the Bernalillo County ordinance, “It is un- lawful for a person to allow an animal to persistently or  continuously bark, howl or make noise common to their  species or otherwise disturb the peace and quiet of in- habitants of the county.” [Ord. §6.47(a)]  If you are bothered by a barking dog, please first let  its owners know that the dog is barking. They may not  be aware, especially if the barking happens only when  they are away. If that doesn’t work, lodge a complaint  with Bernalillo County Animal Care at 468-PETS.

Please don’t. They are not pets.  They are wild animals and should forage like wild animals.  Feeding them makes them look for more food in our yards  and trashcans. Feeding wild animals creates a nuisance  and a very real danger. We  have deer, bobcats, coyotes,  bears, and even mountain li- ons. We are all safer and have  an easier time keeping our  landscaping if these animals  are not counting on us for their  next meal. Deer may only eat  your garden. But bobcats and  coyotes have been known to  eat pets. And if you inadvert- ently get between a mama  bear and her cub, you’ll quickly  learn why we don’t want bears cruising the roads during  the day looking for garbage cans to plunder.  Also, you may think you are just feeding quail or rabbits,  but the larger animals and rodents are happy eating the  corn and seeds as well.   And if you need one more reason to refrain from feed- ing the wildlife, it is against New Mexico State law. For a  first offense, a game warden issues a warning; if you con- tinue to feed, you will get a citation. The result is a court  hearing, with consequences of a $500 fine and/or jail time.    SH Tips & Hacks    Vacations, golf outings or lounging by the pool may be on  your schedule this summer, but save a little time for your  home. Now is a great time to check your house before it  gets too hot. Relax with the knowledge that you’re ready  for summer by taking care of these chores first:  • Trim around outdoor HVAC units. Grass and weeds  around the units can affect their efficiency and could  even cause expensive damage.  • Inspect wood decks. If the wood is showing its age,  summer can be a good time to apply a coat of stain  or sealant. Tap down any protruding nails and sand  rough areas to ensure safety through the seasons.  • Check stucco. Warm weather is ideal for cleaning and  inspecting stucco. Pay close attention to each area of  your walls as you clean them, looking for cracks, peel- ing and any other signs of trouble.  • Inspect foundation and crawlspace. Look for cracks  that may need repair. If you have a crawlspace, check  it right after a heavy rain to make sure there’s no wa- ter getting in there.  • Test drip/irrigation system. If you have an under- ground drip or irrigation system, leaks in the tubing,  pipes or connections can cause your water bills to  skyrocket. Be sure irrigation occurs in the cooler  hours—too much is lost to evaporation if you water  during the heat of the day. The Environmental Pro- tection Agency offers excellent tips for maintaining  your irrigation system.    Do YOU Love Sandia Heights?  Claudia Mitchell    Back in Dec 2021 after a week of looking at houses all over  the Albuquerque area, a place came up for sale in Sandia  Heights. We turned oﬀ Tramway onto Live Oak and en- tered a new world. There were no overhead utilities to im- pede the views across the Rio Grande Valley and up to the  dramatic escarpment of the Sandias. The areas surround- ing the houses had been left natural—dotted with juniper,  pinon, native shrubs, grasses, and granite boulders. The  homes were all unique but consistent with a Southwest  vibe. They looked well-kept and loved. They blended into  the natural colors of the land. We learned that deer, coy- ote, and bobcats roamed the arroyos freely without the  impediment of wire fences and that the night skies were  unmarred by streetlights and porchlights. We had not  seen an area like this! We were thrilled that our bid for the  house was accepted and in Jan 2022 we moved here from  Whidbey Island, WA. After getting settled in, we volun- teered for the Board and committees to help maintain this  environment that we love.  There just is not another place like this! The developers  of Sandia Heights had a vision in 1965. In 1972 the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association was created with the  sole goal of preserving the unique character and quality of  life of this beautiful foothill community. Over ﬁfty years  later, we still enjoy this beauty only because a group of  people have cared enough to protect it with carefully  thought-out covenants that protect the welfare and com- mon interests of homeowners, including their property  values. Without this group of volunteers, you would not  be able to enjoy what you see around you today.  Do you love Sandia Heights? If you do, please consider  joining the Board to keep this vision alive. The Board is in  desperate need of members to keep it as a viable legal en- tity recognized by Bernalillo County and the State of New  Mexico. Only a few hours a month of your time will keep  this place beautiful for the next ﬁfty years and beyond.  Show your love!      8   The GRIT – May 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 5    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  8 Juniper Hill Rd – Replace TPO  32 Juniper Hill Rd – Replace Garage Door  42 Cedar Hill Pl - Landscaping  122 Juniper Hill Rd – Extend Fence  328 Paintbrush Drive – PV Panel Installation  438 Live Oak Loop – Replace Doors/Install Door  449 Live Oak Loop – Repair/Re-stucco Courtyard Wall,  Replace Driveway, Replace Windows, Doors  449 Live Oak Loop – Re-Stucco  532 Roadrunner Lane – Repaint Stucco  536 Black Bear Rd – Gazebo Installation  575 Black Bear Rd – Re-roof  631 Cougar Loop – Stucco Refinishing  643 Cougar Loop – Re-roof  869 E Tramway Lane Ct – PV Panel Installation  901 Tramway Lane – Minor Roof Repairs  1002 Tramway Lane – Shade Structure Installation  1025 Tramway Lane – PV Panel Installation  1027 Tramway Lane – Workshop/Studio Addition  1144 Marigold Drive – Re-stucco  1563 Eagle Ridge Court – Replace Canales  1724 Quail Run Court – Retaining walls/Landscape  1801 Tramway Terrace Loop – Re-roof Patio  1812 Tramway Terrace Loop - Landscaping  1922 Quail Run Dr – PV Panel Installation  2158 Black Willow Dr – Garage Door Replacement  2158 Black Willow Dr – Re-roof  2158 Black Willow Dr – Repaint Door & Trim  2158 Black Willow Dr – Replace Windows  2813 Tramway Circle – Roof Repair  2813 Tramway Circle – Stucco Repair  2833 Tramway Circle – Replace Wood Gates  2878 Brushwood St – Repaint Trim, Garage, Canales  8231 Raintree Drive – PV Panel Installation            Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

Stan Davis    The Sandia Granite is not Granite! That heretical state- ment is a bit of tongue-in-cheek, so rest assured that  it’s perfectly fine to call the Sandia Granite a granite, af- ter all, “Granite” is in its name. The term granite is used  to classify a broad range of igneous rocks. In the world  of petrology, igneous rocks are generally classified by  their physical appearance and mineral makeup: gran- ites are coarse grained in that you can see individual  crystals and they contain predominantly light-colored  felsic minerals such as quartz and certain feldspars, but  can also be “peppered” with dark minerals. The Sandia  Granite tends to contain predominantly quartz, a pink  feldspar and a white feldspar. The relatively low  amount of quartz compared to feldspars has led aca- demics to classify the Sandia Granite as a Monzogran- ite, Monzonite, and/or Granodiorite, all of which could  be considered to fall under the granite umbrella. Gen- erally, a “true” Granite, which is rare, contains a larger  amount of quartz in proportion to feldspars than the  Sandia Granite tends to exhibit.   One of the feldspars abundant in the Sandia Granite  is pink, potassium-rich microcline (KAlSi3O8). Some of  these crystals have grown quite large relative to the  other minerals in the rock, resulting in what is called a  porphyritic texture. In some places the microcline is so  abundant relative to other minerals that it would be  tempting to call that rock a Quartz Syenite (although  I’ve not seen that term applied to the Sandia Granite).  Seen from a distance, the high cliffs facing our neigh- borhood exhibit gigantic pink-to-red “splotches”,  thanks to the microcline. So, variations in the mineral  content and crystal size in the Sandia Granite naturally  lead to variations in the color of the rock. It has been  reported that in some places the Sandia Granite con- tains large proportions of dark brown biotite mica—up  to 50 percent(!)—hence darkening the overall appear- ance. Weathering can alter minerals, especially feld- spars and micas, leading to still more color variations.  In some places the granite is devoid of the pink feld- spars altogether, resulting in a white or “salt-and-pep- per” granite, such as can be seen in the stunning Roza- miento Canyon, whose entrance lies at the eastern  edge of North Sandia Heights.   At any rate, no matter what you call the Sandia Gran- ite, you can’t deny the fine canvas in our own backyard  that these Sandia Mountain cliffs provide for colorful  Albuquerque sunsets.

That  seems to be especially  true when it comes to  gardens. The patient  householder will strug- gle and struggle with  elaborate irrigation sys- tems, fertilizers, green- houses, special soils,  just to prove he can outdo his environment and expand  its horizons by growing plants that don’t naturally live  in his area, an activity which is especially challenging  here with Southwest climate and soils.  I carefully tend a couple of pots of gorgeous pink im- patiens on my shady terrace each summer thinking  how splendid they are, but near Rio de Janeiro where  they grow everywhere in the country, the locals are not  so enthusiastic. Impatiens are so invasive that they  have made it impossible for some coffee plantations to  produce.  Another plant I’m fond of (which so far the rabbits  have ignored!) is butterfly bush (buddleia) which has  now been hybridized to a rather well behaved shrub  and comes in lovely shades of purple, blue, white and  sometimes pink. It seems happy here with a small  amount of water. It surprised me in southern England  to see it growing out of abandoned walls and sidewalk  cracks—clearly a weed, maybe a pest.  There’s a long list of plants like this—fine in one sit- uation, a nuisance in another. Red valerian seems to be  a rather restrained and acceptable plant under our dry  conditions; in California, it seems the plant that may  take over the world, appearing everywhere it’s not  wanted. In California, too, the pretty pink Mexican  evening primrose is an obstreperous plant growing  completely out of bounds but here is more constrained  by moisture limitations. Almost a weed there, an okay  plant in most gardens here.  The reverse is true; some of New Mexico’s common  plants, to which we pay little attention, are treasured  elsewhere. Sometimes, if conditions are right, the  lovely Santa Fe phlox will appear in the grass around  my house. It’s a little shy at this elevation but in the  spring can produce a brilliant pink many places in the  state. Imagine my surprise when browsing through an  English horticulture report about culture of alpine  plants with elaborate instructions on making gravel  troughs for them to live, to find that “the most difficult  of all Alpine plants to grow” had won a special garden  show prize—it was a phlox nana, our Santa Fe phlox.  Thousand of miles [sic] away someone treasured this  lovely plant, and I feel guilty for not really giving it its  due when it volunteered to grow in my own yard!  New Mexico’s beautiful evergreen pineleaf penste- mon from our mountains, easy to grow and a delight  year round, was not very well known in our nurseries  until just recently. In England, it has been grown for a  long time and hybridized for color, resulting in yellow  and pink strains of the plant. But, of course, the English  take horticulture very seriously, and we’re just begin- ning to think about planting in the Southwest.  Meanwhile, our wild plants are our New Mexico  treasures and hard to grow elsewhere. Let’s treasure  our WEEDS and not just let them be treasures some- where else!
