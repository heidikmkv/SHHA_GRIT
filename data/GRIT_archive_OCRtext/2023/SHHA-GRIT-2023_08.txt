The judge recognized that the  Elena Gallegos Open Space (EGOS) Deed controlled the CIty’s actions and  upheld the permanent injunction. The EGOS will forever be protected  from buildings and government development. The injunction ensures  that the City can legally construct only the structures explicitly allowed by  the Warranty Deed between Albuquerque Academy and the City of Albu- querque: picnic tables, benches, open-walled structures, barbecue grills,  drinking fountains, horseshoe pits, volleyball courts, and restrooms. EGOS  will be preserved and maintained as open-space wilderness.  This is a big win for Sandia Heights residents in preserving the wilder- ness and the forest space around us. It is rare when 18 Albuquer- que/BernCo citizen plaintiffs take on the City of Albuquerque and win. The  permanent injunction was agreed to by the City in mid-June versus set- tling in court. The judge recognized and upheld the EGOS Deed.    We all owe a debt of gratitude to the “Save the Elena Gallegos” group  members for steadfastly working this issue over the last 1.5 years, along  with those Sandia Heights residents (and other citizens) who contributed  towards the legal fees to make this possible. In particular, thanks go to  Katrina and Kiko Sanchez, and Viki Teahan—Sandia Heights residents  who led this effort. Viki Teahan, a past member of the SHHA Environment  and Safety Committee, also did a great job of keeping Sandia Heights res- idents informed throughout with GRIT articles.    Wanted: GRIT Editor    Are you a good writer? Do you, without even trying, see errors and ty- pos in books, newspapers, blog pages? Do you know what a “text box” is  in Microsoft Word? You should consider being editor of   this newsletter! The current editor, Susan McCasland, is   retiring from the position on or before the next Annual   Meeting in February. On-the-job training, if desired, will   be available until then. Think about it! And if interested,  contact the office.  2   The GRIT – August 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 8    Trash Can Transgressors  David Crossley, Architectural Control Committee Chair    Drive down any street in Sandia Heights and you’ll no- tice many visible trash cans, something specifically pro- hibited by the covenants. My own house featured visi- ble cans, making us violators (!), so I decided to correct  that. First, I used Photoshop to create a handout to  show potential gate fabricators:         Current appearance  Drawing of gate idea  Then I looked online for a metal shop to do the job— a painful and frustrating experience. I called a total of 7  (SEVEN!) contractors. Some came over and then van- ished. Some never showed. And one actually worked  out a detailed design, gave me a bid which I accepted  and then…crickets. I got the Covid excuse, the I’m-out- of-town excuse, and the post-Covid short-handed ex- cuse. That ate up 18 months. Expect a headache. Any- way, here is the final result, which includes a quail since  we are in Quail Ridge.   So, if your cans are an eyesore, have a decorative  gate made, as I did.  [ed.

Simms Park where it  powers trailhead lights, the public restroom and other fa- cilities.” The line will be installed four feet underground,  approximately 2750 feet long, each segment ending  with a 3ft x 4ft concrete maintenance box, approxi- mately 5 total.  Here are some early comments and questions from  SH residents:  • PNM previously replaced an underground line in Pino  Arroyo (Tramway/Simms Park Road). Contractors  Kelly Cable and Titan Construction, with total disre- gard for the land, left unremediated deep tracks and  ruts from the heavy equipment used. Will this project  be different? Who will return the land to its natural  state? When?  • If the park closes at dusk, why is the new power line  needed?  • Has this additional power been planned to support  the education center and other facilities that are now  not going to be built? If so, the power line is not  needed.  • Does an existing line follow this track? Why is it so far  north of the entry station and most picnic facilities?  What is there that needs power along this route?  To comment on the “PNM Tramway 11 Replacement  Line Project” before August 6, email Amanda Rael, the  deputy district ranger, at amanda.rael@usda.gov.  We will continue to look into this.      3   The GRIT – August 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 8  Continued on page 7…  The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell    This is a continuation of a series of articles about some  of the early members of the Sandia Heights Artists.  These artists will be exhibiting in the Sandia Heights Art- ists 20th Annual Studio Art Tour September 9&10, 2023.    Barb Nahler  Upon arriving at Barb’s house for our interview, she  immediately ushered me to her front window and said  “shhh!” There, in the shade of two pinons right next to  the house, were two deer settled in and contentedly  chewing their cud. This close communion with the nat- ural environment and wildlife is what drew Barb from  Indiana to Sandia Heights in 2004. That year the first  Sandia Heights Artists Tour was held. Barb arrived too  late to participate, but she joined the group soon after  and her home has been a tour stop ever since. She has  embraced the local art scene and has served as a past  president of the Rio Grande Art Association.   Barb grew up in southern Indiana on a small farm.  There was not much time for art, but between chores  Barb was an emerging artist. “I was always drawing. I  even drew on the insides of the chicken house.” Once a  week, an art teacher came to her school and Barb  basked in the time to draw and paint. When she was 18,  she left the farm for school at Indiana State University  where she majored in art. A broad array of art classes  was required, and Barb found that she loved oil paint- ing. “I like the way the way the oils work: how they mix  and the way they look. I like the effects I can do with it.  I just love it. I don’t know what else to say!” Barb com- pleted her B.A. and master’s and spent 26 years in the  Indiana public schools teaching mostly art. She was  teaching but she was always learning, too. Olga  Schubkagel, one of her early supervisors, emphasized  that the elements of art were space, line, value, color,  and texture. Barb internalized these principles. “I am in- terested in utilizing those elements to express how I am  feeling—to create my art. Olga is my inspiration for  what I am doing now.”  “Although I was taught realism and was always a re- alist, since I moved here, I’ve gone off and been totally  creative. I’ve gotten away from realism and I’ve gone  out on my own.” Barb has a studio in a space she shares  with 11 other artists. She has had this space 15 years and  goes there nearly every weekday and often on week- ends. In this dedicated space she focuses solely on cre- ating with paint, canvas and, especially, texture. She ex- periments with cutting the canvas, stitching frayed ends  together, gathering the canvas into forms, using  threads and yarn and molding paste onto the surface.  “My paintings come out of my head. My emerging  painting has to speak to me. If I come back to the studio  the next day and it doesn’t speak to me, I have to  change it.”  Barb explained, “My paintings have gone in several  different directions. I think I have developed a certain  style now.” Her style is indeed unique and imaginative.  Barb calls her paintings “Abstrascapes.” The walls of  her home are hung with these colorful and emotive ab- strascapes large and small. Walking into her house is like  walking into a private art museum and it is just as excit- ing and inspiring. “I love trying different things—exper- imenting. Creativity takes courage.”  Barb’s work can be seen during the Sandia Heights  Artists Tour, Sept 9 & 10.        Carol Erickson  When you pick up a book, do you think about the pa- per, cover material, the way it was made? Carol Erickson  does because she is a 20-year-plus expert bookbinder  who creates artistic handmade books and journals from  scratch.  As soon as Carol learned to read, she became an insa- tiable reader. Her parents were avid readers and took  her and her sister to the library almost daily as they  quickly devoured their loaned allotments. “I can still re- member the texture and smell of the books and paper.”  Her family moved to Albuquerque when she was in high  school. She graduated from the University of New Mex- ico and continued there to earn her Masters. Carol  taught middle and high school in the Albuquerque  school district for 28 years, her last 13 years spent at La  Cueva High School. She specialized in English, speech,  debate, U.S. and world history. She read a lot of books!  About 20 years ago, while still teaching, a friend gave  her a bookbinding kit. She completed the kit following  the steps to a completed book. She found the process  deeply satisfying. She had always loved books and now  she could make one!  Carol was eager to learn more, but  there  were  no  resources  in  Albuquerque  then.

She was in- spired by the versatility, techniques, and challenge of  the art of bookbinding. She received extensive training  in all aspects of the craft. Finally, in 2008, she organized  her local bookbinding friends into a group for home  study and learning. It is still going. When Zoom came  along, it brought a new and useful venue for presenting  and attending group workshops. “You can watch the in- structor closely and really see every detail. You do not  have to pack up materials. It is a real blessing.”  In her 20-plus years of experience, Carol has acquired  the unique tools and equipment of the bookbinder. She  has special knives for cutting sheets of paper and  leather, including a Scharffix leather paring machine to  skive (thin out) leather to the desired thickness and fin- ish.  She has a Kwikprint stamping machine for imprint- ing titles on the covers. She uses bonefolders and spe- cific needles and thread to fold and stitch together the  “signatures” which, when bound together, form the fin- ished book. They are all manual, low-tech tools which,  when handled by a knowledgeable person can turn out  a beautifully bound book or journal. “I feel joy working  with age-old techniques and doing what people did cen- turies ago.”  Carol carefully chooses the paper, endpapers, cover  material, cover decoration, and closures for her unique  bound beauties. She must visualize the infinite combi- nations of these elements as a finished creation. “For a  long time, I did not consider myself an artist. It would  amaze me when people would call me an artist. Now, I  do consider myself an artist. It is an art.” Carol joined her  fellow Sandia Heights Artists in 2009.  At the end of our interview Carol told me, “E-books  will never replace the sensual appeal of real books, es- pecially hand-made books. It gives me joy when some- one purchases one of my favorites—that I created  something that they like as much as I do. I am especially  joyous when a child wants one.”   Carol’s work can be seen at the Sandia Heights Art- ists Tour September 9 & 10.       Welcome to Mazatza-landia!  Stan Davis  The Sandia Mountains and Sandia Granite get all the glory  around here, but what about the Rincon and the meta- morphic rocks there? Here “Rincon” refers to Rincon  Ridge, which includes prominent Juan Tabo Peak, and the  Rincon “Hills” situated between the southern part of the  Ridge and FR333. The Sandia Granite crystalized into solid  rock during the MESOproterozoic (~1.45 billions of years  ago (Ga)); but the Rincon metamorphic rocks, which are  much older, were formed during the PALEOproterozoic  (~1.65 Ga).   If you park ~1.6 miles up FR333 at the western terminus  of the Old La Luz trail, and hike mapped trails west into the  depths of Juan Tabo Canyon, you will start your hike in  Sandia Granite and end in Rincon metamorphics. Actually,  on your drive up you will pass impressive roadcuts show- ing the convoluted fabric of some of the metamorphic  rocks on the western side of the road. A prior article in The  GRIT focused on the Sandia Granite; here, introduction is  made to the Rincon metamorphic rocks, which are mainly  schists and gneisses. The granite and the metamorphics  are very different types of rocks; however, their origins  are underpinned by the same central phenomenon of  Plate Tectonics along a long-lasting convergent plate  boundary.   The metamorphic rocks in the Rincon are, at the risk of  oversimplification, characterized by fabrics with locally  pervasive near-alignment of sparkly grains—as in schists— and by wavy and convoluted banding of light and dark  minerals—as in gneisses—and by variations in between.  Metamorphic rocks are formed when pre-existing rocks of  any type are subjected to elevated heat and pressure with- out melting. These forces cause new minerals to form, and  new fabrics to be imparted into the rocks. Sophisticated  geological analyses of the metamorphic rocks tell a story  of a “terrane,” or province, of which the Rincon is a local  surface exposure, that was subjected to widespread re- gional metamorphism prior to emplacement of the Sandia  Granite. But what caused all this metamorphism in the first  place?  The fundamental answer to that question is that suc- cessive island arc and micro-continent terranes were at  one time colliding in a northwestward direction (using to- day’s orientation) with a pre-existing continental land- mass called Laurentia. The metamorphic rocks in the Rin- con, as well as in Tijeras Canyon and the Manzano moun- tains, are exposed vestiges of a continent-wide metamor- phic province called the “Mazatzal”—named after the  southern Arizona Mazatzal (“Land of the Deer”) Moun- tains, which are the “type” locale for these types of rocks.  The   Mazatzal   province   extended   across   present-day   8   The GRIT – August 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 8  ACC Activity Log   Summary of Approved -Projects activity since the last GRIT:  23 Cedar Hill Road  – Replace Wire Fence  42 Cedar Hill Place – Mini-Split AC Unit Installation  53 Rock Ridge Dr.-Stucco Repair, Re-paint Stucco, Trim  301 Spring Creek Place – PV Panel Installation  378 Juniper Hill Road - Landscaping  606 Cedar Hill Road – Backyard Upgrades  793-G Tramway Lane – PV Panel Installation 806 Tramway Lane – Raise Block Wall  840 Live Oak Road – Re-roof with Shingles  869-E Tramway Lane Ct. - Re-paint Door/Garage 881 Tramway Lane Ct. – Replace Fence/Wall  940 Bobcat Blvd – PV Array Installation  1004 Tramway Lane – HVAC Replacement  1121 Marigold Drive – Replace Fence  1454 Honeysuckle Drive – Window replacement/Back- yard remodel (includes pool)  1554 Eagle Ridge Lane – PV Array Installation  1849 Tramway Terrace Loop - Landscaping  1904 Quail Run Road – Re-roof w/TPO  2176 Black Willow Dr – Extend Back Patio Concrete Slab  2176 Black Willow Dr – Install Lantern Bulb Lighting  2819 Tramway Circle– Install Crusher Fine Driveway  8246 Raintree Drive – Re-roof with TPO  9516 Ridge Vista Dr. – PV Array Installation    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read   about all projects currently under ACC management.

The Mazatzal orogeny reconfigured the  Earth’s crust and caused the crust to thicken, due to  subduction of crustal slabs from colliding island arcs  and due to compression of the plates. This crustal  thickening caused huge mountain chains to rise and  deep crustal “roots” to push down. It is within these  deep “roots” that rocks became metamorphosed from  heat and pressure. Some of these buried metamorphic  rocks survived subsequent tectonic activity and ero- sion over the millennia, resulting in them becoming ex- posed at the surface where we can see and walk on  them today—practically in our own “backyard.”  A complication to the story of the Mazatzal orogeny  is the occurrence of two periods of magmatic intrusion  activity. The initial generation of intrusions occurred  during the Mazatzal orogeny itself, while the latter pe- riod occurred after the Mazatzal, during a subsequent  orogeny, when island arcs from the south continued to  collide and subduct crustal slabs below the growing  continent. As a result, some of the rocks in the deep  subducted slabs went through a process called partial  melting, causing huge plutons of molten rock (magma)  to rise and be emplaced into the pre-existing, overlying  solidified metamorphic Mazatzal crustal rocks them- selves. These bodies of magma were a special type of  “rarefied” material, which would eventually cool and  solidify—still deep within the subsurface—into a solid  rock type we know as … granite. And, one of those  granite bodies—one that formed during the latter pe- riod—just happens to be known as … the Sandia Gran- ite, which with eventual uplift and erosion of overlying  rocks became exposed in what we call … the Sandia  Mountains. So, the next time you hike the Rincon Hills,  and leave the granite on the eastern side and enter the  older metamorphics on the western, pause and think  upon the grandiose plate tectonic happenings going  on that created these rocks over a billion years ago!   [Note: the plate tectonics history of the Proterozoic is  an extremely complex story that has been evolving and  becoming increasingly “into focus” over decades of in- vestigations by numerous academics through field work  and laboratory studies. This article is necessarily a distil- lation. But the story is too good to not share with all of  us living in “Mazatza-landia”! References for this and all  prior geology articles are available upon request].    Examples of convoluted-banded gneiss from Rincon Hills (top) and ledges  of schist (sometimes referred to as “schistose gneiss”) from Juan Tabo Can- yon (bottom).      A lot of rocks from “Mazatza-landia” can be found in the southern Manzano  Mountains. In Red Canyon the picture shows one of the more impressive  large vertical slabs of metamorphic quartzite—a rock type not prevalent in  the Rincon—being incised by a stream, forming a waterfall as it cascades  over this barrier (there was abundant water flowing here in May!). Not only  did tectonic island arc collisions cause metamorphism, but it also caused  large-scale faulting and folding of pre-existing sedimentary rocks, resulting  in these vertical beds. Inset shows a sample of this quartzite up close.  12   The GRIT – August 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 8  Dog Law    The SHHA office receives many complaints about nuisances  caused by other people’s pets. Those issues are not covered  in our covenants, but are extensively covered by Bernalillo  County Code, Article V. (Owner’s Duties and Prohibited Ac- tions), and by New Mexico State Statutes. Here are some  common concerns, and the laws that address them:  Dogs Barking and Pooping!  Sec. 6-47. Animals disturbing the peace.  (a) It is unlawful for a person to allow an animal to persis- tently or continuously bark, howl or make noise common to  their species or otherwise disturb the peace and quiet of in- habitants of the county.  (b) It is unlawful to keep or maintain an animal in such an  unclean or unsanitary manner that it disturbs others by nox- ious or offensive odors. (Ord. of 2-26-13)  NM State Law—NMSA §30-20-1. Noise by animals and fowl;  offenses against public peace and order.  BCO § 6-54. Animal waste.  It is unlawful to permit a companion animal to defecate on  public or private property other than the property of the  owner of the animal unless such animal waste is immedi- ately removed and properly disposed of by the person hav- ing custody of the animal.  Dogs Biting. THIS IS SERIOUS, FOLKS!  BCO Definitions: §6-42: Dangerous animal means: An animal  which, when unprovoked, engages in behavior that requires  a defensive action by a person to prevent bodily injury to a  person or another animal which is off the property of the  owner of the animal in question; or an animal which, when  unprovoked, injures a person in a manner which does not  result in muscle tears or disfiguring lacerations, or require  extensive corrective cosmetic surgery…  Vicious animal means an animal which kills or severely in- jures (so as to result in muscle tears or disfiguring lacera- tions, require multiple sutures, or extensive corrective or  cosmetic surgery) a person or domesticated animal. Vicious  animal does not include an animal which bites, attacks or in- jures a person or animal that is unlawfully upon its owner's  premises...  BCO § 6-67. Vicious or dangerous animals.   (a)  It is unlawful for any person to keep or harbor a vicious  animal. When an animal care services officer has probable  cause to believe that an animal is vicious, the officer may  take up and impound the animal into protective custody  awaiting appropriate court proceedings. Following judicial  determination that an animal is vicious, the court having  jurisdiction over the enforcement of this chapter, shall, in  addition to any fine or imprisonment imposed for violation  of this section, order the owner or keeper of such vicious  animal to destroy it humanely or turn such animal over to  the county manager for destruction.  (b) It shall be unlawful to maintain a dangerous animal in a  manner which constitutes a threat to any person or other  animal.  (c)  Any dog that is deemed dangerous by admission of  owner or by court determination shall register the dog  with animal care services by obtaining a dangerous dog  permit. The owner shall comply with all registration and  handling requirements as listed in the NMSA 1978,§77-1A-5  BCO §6-40. Animals biting persons  (a)  The owner of an animal that bites a person and a per- son bitten by an animal shall report that occurrence to the  animal care services department within 24 hours…. The  owner of an animal that bites a person shall surrender said  animal to an animal care services officer if the officer  deems it necessary to impound said animal for a period of  quarantine no less than 10 days from the day of the bite.  (h) It is unlawful for a person to keep an animal reported  to have bitten any person on two unprovoked separate in- cidents. The owner has a duty to destroy said animal hu- manely or surrender such an animal to the animal care ser- vices department for…euthanasia.  NM State Law (Vicious Animals, NMSA 1978 § 77-1-10 and  Dangerous Dog Act 77-1A-1, et seq.) varies slightly from  Bernalillo County in definitions of dangerous dog…its  lesser charge is “potentially dangerous dog” and the more  serious is “dangerous dog.” Further, State law provides for  felony charges for the owner of a dangerous or potentially  dangerous dog that causes serious injury or death to a do- mestic animal, without provocation and “shall be sentenced  in accordance with the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA  1978.”  https://www.bernco.gov/animal-care-services/wp-content/up- loads/sites/61/2021/03/animal_care_ord_9-2013.pdf  BernCoAnimalOrdinance: https://library.munic- ode.com/nm/bernalillo_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?no- deId=BECOCO_CH6AN  IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE REGARDING ANIMALS IN BERNALILLO  COUNTY, CALL 468-PETS TO SPEAK WITH AN ANIMAL CARE OFFICER.       In summary, be a good neighbor. Keep your dog leashed  when away from your yard, reasonably quiet when at  home, and pick up poo. Leaving your pet’s mess is nasty  and inconsiderate. Take the filled poo bag with you!  Next time: leash laws and animals running at large.  13 The GRIT – August 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 8 14   The GRIT – August 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 8  Oh Deer!

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Cork & Fork has resumed having bimonthly dinners. We  gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts.

The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year. All  adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
