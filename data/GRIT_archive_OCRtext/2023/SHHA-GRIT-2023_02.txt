SHHA  2   The GRIT – February 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 2  SHHA Wildfire Risk Reduction Workshop  Cathleen McCaughey, Environment & Safety chair    On March 25, 10:00–11:30 AM, at the Church of the Good  Shepherd (7834 Tennyson St NE), SHHA is holding a  workshop to provide critical information about specific  steps you can take to greatly reduce the likelihood  that your home will be damaged by wildfire. Because  Sandia Heights is in the “wildland-urban interface”  (WUI), our homes and community are at risk from fires  started by lightning, as well as by careless cigarette  tossing and other human hazards. The good news is  that we can “harden” our homes, creating effective  self-defense systems against fast-moving wildfire. At  the workshop, experts will discuss the elements of the  home and surrounding environment that should be ad- dressed to protect both against wildfire. Invited agen- cies include the Bernalillo County Fire Department, the  Bernalillo County Office of Homeland Security and  Emergency Services, and the Ciudad Soil & Water Con- servation District. More details in the next GRIT.        You, the SHHA, and   Covenant Enforcement  Bob Thomas, CSC Chair    The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) is charged with  ensuring that all property owners in Sandia Heights ad- here to covenant provisions of the Unit where their  property is located. There are 38 Units within Sandia  Heights, and no two sets of covenants are exactly the  same. This diversity makes community-wide enforce- ment difficult at best. The CSC does not patrol Sandia  Heights looking for covenant violations. Consequently,  the CSC has developed procedures that depend on  members of the SHHA to report covenant violations.  Who can report a violation? You must be a property  owner in Sandia Heights and be a member of SHHA to  submit a covenant violation form. The form, Report of  Suspected Covenant Violation, is available at the SHHA  office and from the SHHA website. Any SHHA member  may submit a covenant violation form, however, the  CSC normally acts on submissions from residents in the  same Unit as the violation, in an adjacent Unit, or in di- rect line of sight of the violation regardless of the Unit  you reside in. The CSC will exercise its discretion as to  whether or not to act on violations outside of the nor- mal guidelines. The CSC considers the identities of the  complainant and alleged violator, addresses, and the  nature of the complaint to be strictly confidential and  does not divulge such information beyond the CSC.  What information is needed on the violation form?  Your name as the complainant; CSC may want to contact  you for additional details related to your complaint. The  specific violation and its location, along with the ra- tionale supporting your belief that a violation has oc- curred. It helps to identify the paragraph in the applica- ble covenants that you think is being violated. All the  Unit covenants are on the website; also, the office can  help you identify applicable covenants. The form asks if  you have contacted the violator—contact is not re- quired to submit the form. The CSC is sensitive about  not creating an adversarial relationship between the  complainant and the alleged violator. You may choose  to talk to your neighbor first but the CSC does not re- quire this. Last is your signature. The SHHA staff recog- nizes electronic signatures that include the member’s e- mail address. The CSC does not respond to complaints  submitted by phone, notes, or anonymously.  How does the CSC handle the complaint? A CSC  member is assigned to investigate the complaint and try  to resolve it. The member first verifies the information  submitted. If the complaint is deemed invalid, the com- plainant is notified by mail and the file closed. If a valid  violation exists, the committee member completes an  investigative report. The violator receives written noti- fication from the CSC regarding the specific violation  and is given a reasonable deadline by which to remedy  it. The CSC member follows up with the violator to en- sure that the violation is corrected by the stated time. If  the violation is resolved at this point, both parties are  notified by mail and the file is closed. If, however, the  violation is not resolved as a result of the first letter, a  second letter is sent to the violator with a new timeline  for resolution and a warning that failure to comply may  result in legal action. If the second letter is unsuccessful  in solving the violation, the file is turned over to the  SHHA attorney for further action.

Judging by the abundance of cri- noid fossils, as can be observed along many of the trails  that travel across the limestone, the Pennsylvanian in  this area must have been an “Age of Crinoids.” Indeed,  there was a huge proliferation of crinoid species  throughout New Mexico during the Pennsylvanian  (Webster and Kues, 2006, Pennsylvanian Crinoids of New  Mexico, New Mexico Geology, 28, 1). Usually calcareous  fossils are as gray (or nearly so) as the background lime- stone in which they are embedded, and indeed most of  the crinoid fossils I’ve seen while hiking in the Sandias  tend to be shades of gray. However, there are some  places where the crinoids are orange!   Crinoids were animals that lived in marine continen- tal shelf environments. Crinoids tended to resemble  plants, and consisted of a “holdfast” to anchor them- selves to a substrate, a long columnal stalk, and a crown  of radiating feathery arms that performed planktonic fil- ter feeding.  When they died and fell to the sea floor,  they became easily disarticulated and crushed up with  current reworking and scavenging by other animals.  Generally, the most abundant crinoid fossilized remains  are fragments of the columnal stalk, and this appears  true in the Sandias, too.  According to Dr. Virgil Lueth, professor emeritus with  the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Re- sources (2022, personal communication), large replace- ments of limestone by chalcedony/jasper (types of sil- ica, or micro-crystalline quartz) are not uncommon  along the Rio Grande Rift near areas of significant bar- ite-fluorite mineralization. Indeed, at the abandoned  Lands End barite mine in the northern Sandias along the  Osha Springs Trail, one can find abundant barite (bar- ium sulphate) crystals scattered all around on the  ground. The source of these minerals was likely caused  by circulating hydrothermal fluids introduced during the  rifting activity that raised the Sandia Mountains, the  Manzanos and others, above the Rio Grande Rift. Dr.  Lueth further states that colored fossils, where the orig- inal gray calcareous material was replaced by chalced- ony colored by hematite (red iron oxide, Fe2O3), have  been reported in the Madera Limestone.   The phenomenon by which originally calcareous (or  calcite/magnesium-rich) fossils become replaced by sil- ica (micro-crystalline quartz) while the surrounding  matrix, or background, limestone does not become re- placed, is a well-observed phenomenon (Malva and  Siever, 1988, Mechanism and Controls of Silicification of  Fossils in Limestones, The Journal of Geology, 96, 4, 387- 398). The process is complicated, having to do with ge- ochemical and physical processes. What is necessary is  that the composition of the original calcite of the fossils  must be sufficiently different from that of the surround- ing limestone matrix so as to allow circulating silica-rich  fluids to replace the calcite in the fossils and not the sur- rounding limestone matrix itself. The silicified crinoids  also appear to be harder and more resistant to erosion  than the limestone in which they are embedded, so they  tend to stick out of the limestone. Pretty cool!       Orange crinoid stalk fossil fragments, taken from a location along the North Crest Trail  not far above the junction with the Ojo Del Orno trail, Sandia Mountains.      Typical gray crinoid stalk fossil fragments found in the Madera Limestone, from  north to south in the Sandia Mountains.     4   The GRIT February 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 2  DECEMBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

This  month, let’s see what you might want to check on every  month of the year.      Check HVAC system filters. Some air filters are reusa- ble, while others are disposable and must be replaced.  Clean or replace filters when they get dirty, which might  be anywhere from 30 days to a few months.      Look for leaks around toilets and sinks. Any sign of  water where it shouldn’t be is reason to investigate fur- ther. Even a tiny leak could cost hundreds of dollars  each year in addition to wasting a precious resource all  too rare in our high-desert environment.      Inspect grout and caulking. Touch up any voids or  cracks in tubs and showers. This keeps them looking  nice while helping to avoid seeping water damage.      Check kitchen vent/range hood filter. Clean or re- place if needed. Consider looking at the filter more of- ten if you have an avid chef in the household.      Test smoke and carbon-monoxide detectors. In addi- tion to a monthly test, Consumer Reports explains why  you should change batteries every six months. Make a  habit of changing the batteries when you change your  clocks to go on or off Daylight Savings Time.      Trip your GFCI outlets. These can be located any- where in your home, but are most commonly found  close to water sources (bathroom, kitchen, laundry  room). Plug a light into the outlet, then click the “test”  button to see if the light goes out, then click “reset” and  see if the light goes back on. If so, you’re good; if not,  it’s time to replace the outlet.      Stroll around outside. You’re probably outside your  home on a regular basis, but how often do you really  look it over? Walk around the house, looking for prob- lems with the foundation, vents, gutters, downspouts  and drainpipes.  8   The GRIT – February 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 2  ACC Activity Log   Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  98 Juniper Hill Road – Garage Addition  358 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Patio Installation  573 Black Bear Road – Replace Outdoor Light Fixtures  573 Black Bear Road – Replace Garage Doors  720-13 Tramway Lane – Build Enclosed Platform Over Front Door Passageway 989 Lynx Loop – Backyard Landscaping Within Existing  Fencing  1180 Laurel Place – Landscaping  1538 Eagle Ridge Place – Replace Windows, Repair  Walls, and Stucco    1843 Tramway Terrace Loop – Landscaping  1850 Tramway Terrace Loop – Reroof  1850 Tramway Terrace Loop – Repaint Trim, Garage  Door, Vigas, Canales,   1945 Quail Run Loop – Reroof  2529 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Existing Fence  with a Block Wall  2745 Tramway Circle – TV Satellite Dish Installation    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read   about all projects currently under ACC management.

Fred Wieker  Connie Welty  Connie Welty  12   The GRIT – February 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 2  Monthly Fun Fact  Petroglyph National Monument on Albuquerque’s  West Mesa has around 24,000 Native American petro- glyphs chipped into volcanic rocks. The 7,236-acre  monument contains one of the largest petroglyph sites  in North America. Most of the glyphs were carved be- tween 400 to 700 years ago, though some are much  older, perhaps as much as 3,000 years old.  The volcanic basalt escarpment where the glyphs  are located results from lava flows associated with the  Albuquerque Volcanoes, a classic and rare example of  a fissure eruption. The fissure is over 5 miles long and  the volcanic cones are aligned along it. The volcanic es- carpment and cones formed about 150,000 years ago  in six lava flows. The volcanoes are now dormant, but  not extinct!  13 The GRIT – February 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 2 The View from Jack Rabbit Hill  Historical article from January 1988 GRIT  Jean Heflin  From my window, I can  see the double black  dots of the ears of a  mammoth jack rabbit  bouncing up and down  above the grasses and I  wonder whether he or I  will be first to enjoy the  plants I set out last fall in  the front of the house.  Very early in the morn- ing the coyotes went by outside the fence discussing  the hunt in their high pitched barks. The scaled quail  don’t seem to mind that only the bare bones of the  winter garden are left and cross inside the fence to our  feeder. What a fascinating place we live in.  In some other part [sic] of the country, winter is a  time to pour [sic] over seed catalogues and plan spring  annuals. In Sandia Heights, we do this only on a small  scale. Most of us here don’t want to spend the amount  of time and water necessary to grow many of the  standard annuals. We came here because it was “natu- ral,” but, greedy humans that we are, many of [us]  want our flowers too. Winter here is a good time to  think about what we mean by a “native” or natural gar- den and how that will affect what to do in the spring.  We can start by looking more carefully at all those  little grey plants around us that know so well how to  live in our extreme climate. Sandia Heights has an  abundance of beautiful flowering plants that come in  succession with the seasons that we can encourage  around our homes. The high desert ecology is one of  the most active and diverse anywhere. Each of those  little grey plants fills a niche: spring plants come up,  then die quickly and disappear in the summer heat.  Summer rains bring on the grasses and a different  group of wildflowers. The cooler days of fall bring the  flowering of rabbit brush [aka chamisa] and aster, and  new bloom of some of the established plants. In cold  winters, parts of the garden can look like a moonscape  and yet with the first warm days, it is full of seedlings  coming up.  Plants here are canny; the change of temperature  and moisture levels each year influence which flowers  you will see in profusion. One year a patch of ground  will be covered with gumweed, another year  mostly  14   The GRIT – February 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 2  sweet clover, another year chocolate flower. Wild- flower seeds are very particular about the conditions  under which they will sprout and with each year’s dif- ferent condition you will find a different mix of flowers.  To get to know which plant is which in your area in- clude Flowering Plants of New Mexico by Robert  DeWitt Ivey and Spring Wildflowers of New Mexico by  William C. Martin and Charles R. Hutchins in your winter  reading. Then in the spring as all those little grey plants  start to come up, you can choose your friends. After all,  they know an awful lot about living in Sandia Heights.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
