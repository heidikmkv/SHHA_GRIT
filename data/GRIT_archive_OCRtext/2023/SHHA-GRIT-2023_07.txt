In addi- tion, it was hard to use on a smart phone or tablet. No more! The Sandia  Heights Homeowners website is all new with easier access to the infor- mation you need whether you are using a desktop computer, phone, or  tablet. We encourage you to go see for yourself:  https://www.sandiahomeowners.org  If you do not find what you need or simply have a suggestion for improve- ment, let us know at one of the email addresses at the bottom of the col- umn to the left of this article.      2   The GRIT – July 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 7    Airbnb Room Rental   Satisfactorily Resolved in District Court  Covenant Support Committee    Another reminder: renting out rooms in any residence is  against the Sandia Heights covenants. Your Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) is following up on all com- plaints, and taking this very seriously. If you violate this  rule, you will first get two letters politely asking you to  remove your rental listing from any of the short-term- rental websites. If you do not comply, we will pursue le- gal action. We have just resolved one such violation that  ended with a judgement in District Court in favor of the  Homeowners Association. Remember, the CSC has legal  authority, in District Court if necessary, to enforce your  covenants’ language which prohibits renting out rooms  in your house. Please save time and legal expense, both  yours and that of your Association, and remove from  the web all Airbnb-like listings for room rentals.  Anonymous Complaints. And as a reminder on a dif- ferent topic, the CSC will not pursue any anonymous  complaints. You must identify yourself to the commit- tee before it will look into any issue you may raise. The  CSC will not divulge your name to the homeowner  against whom you are making the complaint.    Wildfire-Resistant Roofing   Can Save Your Home  Read About the Best Roofing Material to Use!  Julie Rochman, Environment & Safety Committee    Here in Sandia Heights, we are privileged to be sur- rounded by beautiful landscapes and commanding  views of both Albuquerque and the mountains. That is  because we live in what is known as the “wildland-urban  interface” (WUI), where development meets forested  land and other open space. However, there also is a  downside to living in the WUI: a very real risk of wildfire.  Fortunately, there are things every homeowner can  and should do to prevent their house and possessions  from being destroyed by wildfire. Of course, some fire  risk reduction actions are easier and less expensive than  others. I would like to focus on one of the more expen- sive, but also most effective, ways: installing a fire-re- sistant roof. The roof is critical; it is any home’s first line  of defense against embers and firebrands (larger pieces  of burning wood) which the wind can carry as far as a  few miles from the perimeter of a wildfire.  Recently, we needed to fix our persistently leaky flat  TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin) roof. I should note that,  prior to retiring and for over a decade, I led a property  insurance industry research organization that worked  closely with roofing companies. So, as long as we had to  put a new cover on our roof, we decided to select a  membrane that provides superior fire protection. In this  case, we went with PVC (polyvinyl chloride) roofing.  If you are re-roofing, please ask your roofer about  what is known as a “Class A” fire-rated roof. Generally,  roofing material fire-related ratings are either Class A,  Class B, or Class C. Class A is the most fire resistant. Class  A roof coverings include concrete or clay tiles, asphalt  shingles and standing seam metal roofs. As a result, all  of these roof covers are excellent choices for Sandia  Heights homes. For homes with flat roofs, there are im- portant differences among membranes used as roof  cover. For example, while PVC roofing is rated Class A,  the more commonly used TPO roofing is rated Class B.  PVC membrane is the most fire-retardant single-ply  roofing membrane, and a much better choice for Sandia  Heights homes than TPO or another rubberized roofing  membrane called EPDM (ethylene propylene diene ter- polymer). PVC is extra protective because: 1) thermo- plastic PVC is the only naturally fire-resistant polymer  among all roofing plastics, and 2) PVC manufacturers  deliberately add more fire retardants to the product  during formulation. These factors make PVC roofing  slow to catch fire and able to self-extinguish. PVC is no  more difficult to install or maintain than TPO. Also, in  case you are wondering, the cost difference between  TPO and PVC roofing is only about 43 cents per square  foot. So, for a 3,000 sq ft roof, PVC would cost $1,290  more than TPO. A worthwhile investment to protect  your home from fire.   To prove this point, here is a short video from South- west Research institute’s Fire Technology Department:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgrRBuTfuf8  While the EPDM and TPO burn and melt pretty quickly,  the PVC self-extinguishes. Impressive. And worth an ex- tra 43¢/sq ft!       Correction  Last month’s GRIT had an article entitled, “Weed and  Fire Season is Here.” The article was credited to the Cov- enant Support Committee. Although it was reprinted at  the request of the CSC, the article was written by Emily  Rudin and originally published in the April 2019 GRIT.

These are book exchanges—boxes  with books in them. The idea is to  take a book and leave a book. We  know of the following little librar- ies in Sandia Heights:  • 342 Whiteoaks Dr NE  • 1606 Quailwood Dr NE   • 1139 Marigold Dr NE   • 1941 Quail Run Loop NE  • 2320 Calle De Gabriel NE  • Corner of Cliffrose and Tennyson in “Charlie's Park”  If you have a little library we have missed or know of  one, let us know at TheGritSHHA@gmail.com. We will  update and publish this list, as needed.  Stop by, drop off a good read, find a new one!  [editor’s note: At the start of the Covid lockdown, I  left a book at the Marigold little library called “Teach  Yourself C in 21 Days” thinking it might be a productive  use of at-home time for someone. Within a few days the  book was no longer in the LL. Just curious if someone  did learn the C programming language and maybe used  it later at work. If it was you, I would appreciate a note  at the email address above. Thanks!   –S. McCasland]    The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell  A continuing series about some early members of the San- dia Heights Artists. These artists will exhibit in the upcom- ing Sandia Heights Artists 20th Annual Studio Art Tour.   Erratum: In the June issue I failed to include artist Lynda  Burch’s website which is www.lyndaburch.com    Eric Guenette  Next time you have a custom-mixed latex paint color  from the hardware store that doesn’t work out, don’t  return it; bring it to Eric Guenette who will use it in his  next piece of highly creative wall art as a main color, an  accent color or whatever his inner creative guide dic- tates. Eric cannot be himself without being creative be- cause he has “always been a creative person.”  When Eric was about seven, he watched his resource- ful grandfather put together a cart from odds and ends.  It amazed Eric and made a life-long impression: with in- genuity you can create things from stuff that others  might throw away. As Eric grew up, he expressed him- self playing his original tunes on guitar. As a young man  he apprenticed as a graphic designer. In about 2000, as  an experiment, he tried doing a painting and his love for  creating visual art was sparked. In his hunger for active  learning, he blazed his own meandering path and ab- sorbed from every art source he encountered.   His artistic journey took him into many genres and  styles of painting. He found that abstract expressionism  resonated deeply with him. Having found that reso- nance, he explored every medium to express it. Re- membering his grandfather using what was at hand to  make something new, Eric incorporates into his art dis- carded custom paint (what he called “oops mixes”),  spray paint, markers, acrylics, ink, scraps of canvas,  wine spills, paint peeled off plastic wrap, found objects,  things people give him—to name just a few. He makes  his own frames and stretches his own canvases. His pro- cess is “very organic, low-tech and often an experience  of serendipity. I create in the spirit of my grandfather. I  think of him every time I create something.”  When asked what inspires and informs his work, Eric  explained, “I have two voices that speak to me: the  technical voice that asks, ‘How could I make this work?’,  and the critical voice that says only ‘Yes! Go!’ or ‘No,  Stop.’ It is the critical voice that is the navigator of my  artistic ship and I follow it to the end. These voices help  me have the courage to even destroy an evolving piece  and move in a new direction. I do not worry about artis- tic rules, ‘shoulds,’ or norms. I follow my own expecta- tions. It can be scary. That is the beautiful tension of be- ing an artist. I want people to approach my art pieces as  if they are looking at clouds when they were kids. Some  may see something, and others may not. I do not want  to define it for them. I want to awaken something in the  viewer that they would not get any other way. Isn’t that  the definition of art?”  Eric joined the Sandia Heights Artists in 2015. He is  very involved; he developed the current logo for the  group and designs and produces the brochures for the  tour. He says, “Don’t buy a piece of art from Target.  Support your local artist. Put something real in your  home!” You can see Eric’s work at newmexicocrea- tive.com and at the Sandia Heights Artists’ Tour 9/9–10.          4   The GRIT July 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 7  MAY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Just give  them to Mary Ellen Merrigan and she will make a unique  piece of jewelry, embellish a found natural object or in- corporate them into a wall hanging. Her creativity  knows no bounds.  Mary Ellen has always loved doing things with her  hands. She enjoyed needlepoint and it was portable. In  1995, she moved to Sandia Heights and travelled all over  the world accompanying her husband to international  balloon festivals. She took her handiwork with her to fill  the odd hours. In 2007, Mary Ellen’s good friend intro- duced her to the world of beading. “It opened up a new  world to me.” Mary Ellen was intrigued and wanted to  learn more. She took classes through the Bead Society  of New Mexico. She went to the Tucson Gem and Min- eral Show and attended seminars. Her new knowledge  led to a thirst for more and in 2016, she took a met- alsmithing class with the University of New Mexico Con- tinuing Education. Her vision and abilities expanded to  making her own hand-wrought chains and findings. She  continues a mentorship with a master metalsmith.  “Hand-shaped chains are like people: every link is ham- mered and shaped on its own. Every link is different.”  Mary Ellen’s jewelry often incorporates whimsical de- signs which repurpose scraps. Her creations have been  referred to as a “weird kind of wonderful.” The pieces  are one-of-a-kind statement pieces that have friends  asking, “Where did you get that?” She says that her  “best work comes when I am playing. I get into the flow,  and I am expressing a feeling in the moment. Even when  I sketch out a design, it is what is in the moment that  shapes what is final and real. A mistake can be ‘another  way of expressing.’ ”  Mary Ellen joined the Sandia Heights Artists in 2011 to  support and celebrate the artistic community here.  Since then, her creative expression has not been limited  to jewelry. She embellishes natural objects like antlers  and animal skulls and transforms them into fantastical  art. She creates wall hangings and stitched fabric cards.  She is evolving in her knowledge and skills to express  “who I am becoming as a person and artist, which are  the same thing.”  “We are all creative. I love and respect that creativity.  Sandia Heights is filled with natural beauty which makes  it so exciting to live here. We artists collaborate to show  people that beauty.”  Mary Ellen’s art can be seen and purchased at  Amapola Gallery in Old Town Albuquerque, and at  www.maryellenbeads.com. She will be participating in  the Sandia Heights Artists’ Tour Sept 9–10.          It’s Hot Out—for You and Your Dog  Judy Durzo    Be aware of hot feet & paws. With our summer temper- atures comes hot asphalt. Asphalt can be 40–60° hotter  than the surrounding air temperature. So, a 100+ sum- mer day can mean walking on a surface as hot as 160°F.  When walking your dog, please be aware of the temper- ature on their paws. At 125°F, skin damage and burns  can occur in 60 seconds…and 125°F asphalt can occur  with only 77°F air temps! Press the back of your hand  firmly against the asphalt for 7 seconds to verify it will  be comfortable and safe for your dog.    When the air tempera- ture is this…  …the asphalt temp can  be as much as this  77°  125°  86°  135°  95°  145°      8   The GRIT – July 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 7    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved -Projects activity since the last GRIT:  1 Juniper Hill Loop – Replace Decks/Patio  6 Eagle Nest Court – Replace Coyote Fence  181 Juniper Hill Road – Replace Evaporative Cooler  310 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Windows/Door, Re- stucco  358 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Evaporative Cooler  438 Live Oak Loop – Small Stucco Wall & Gate Addition  539 Black Bear Rd – Re-roof w/TPO  624 Cedar Hill Rd – Replace Roof Underlayment  726-2 Tramway Vista Court - Landscaping  727-5 Cedar Hill Lane – Rain Gutter Installation  793-G Tramway Lane – Re-roof w/TPO  793-A Tramway Lane – Roof Repair, Re-paint Pergola  795-C Tramway Lane – Replace Garage Door  849 Llave Lane – Stucco Repairs  919 Tramway Lane – PV Array Installation  919 Tramway Lane – Electrical Panel Installation  940 Bobcat Blvd – Extend Driveway  953 Deer Drive – Repaint Stucco, Trim, Garage  Door,                                                                                                       Stoneface addition  1014 Tramway Lane – New Construction  1111 San Rafael Ave – Move Window/Replace Door/Wall  1111 San Rafael Ave – Re-stucco House/Walls  1157 Laurel Loop – PV Panel Installation  1193 Bobcat Blvd – Re-stucco  1553 Eagle Ridge Lane – PV Array Installation  1561 Eagle Ridge Court – Re-roof w/TPO  1706 Quail Run Court – PV Panel Installation  2758 Cliffrose Drive – Stucco Repair/Paint Trim/Garage  2864 Tramway Circle NE - Landscaping  7712 Cedar Canyon Place – Window Replacement  7718 Cedar Canyon Court – AC Unit Relocation  8239 Raintree Drive – Re-stain Exterior Wood Trim  8246 Raintree Drive – Re-paint trim, Garage, Beams      Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

Kate Fry & Diane Barney    Newcomers to Sandia Heights are sometimes alarmed  to learn that several species of mice and rats live in our  area. Not to worry! None of these species are like the  house mice, black rats, and Norway rats that people  dread and that spoil your food. Native mice and rats are  a normal part of our environment, and they prefer to  stay outside. They help keep the insect population un- der control, and they serve as food for other animals.  The easiest way to tell the difference between house  mice and native mice is the tail:  house mice have naked  tails and native mice have furred tails. White-throated  woodrats, also known as pack rats, have furred tails as  well, while Norway- and black-rat tails are bare.  Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Deer mice  are so called because their fur resembles that of deer.  They eat large quantities of insects and caterpillars,  and can rid an area of  insects that are injuri- ous to trees. They also  eat seeds, berries, and  nuts. They are a major  food item for many  predators.  A  small  percentage of deer mice carry Hantavirus, but mice in  the open pose no danger of infection. Take care when  cleaning an enclosed space to avoid exposure to  mouse feces and urine.  Piñon mouse (Peromyscus truei). Like many other  common rodents in  the  Sandias,  piñon  mice are nocturnal and  not often seen. The dis- tinguishing feature of  this mouse is its huge  ears. They eat piñon  nuts when they can  find them, as well as insects and other nuts and berries.  Silky pocket mouse (Perognathus flavus). This small  mouse has light tan  patches behind its ears  and the silky tan fur on  their backs is black- tipped. Silky pocket  mice collect and eat  small seeds.  At a total  length of four inches including its tail, this relative of  kangaroo rats is one of the smallest rodents in North  America.  Northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leuco- gaster). Regarded as the wolf of the rodent world, this  mouse is a carnivore  that howls (although  the howl sounds more  like a squeal to humans).  Grasshopper mice eat  large quantities of crick- ets, grasshoppers, and other insects, and will also eat  lizards and other mice. They weigh about two ounces  and have white feet and a short, stubby tail.  White-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula). These  rats are about twelve inches long, including a 5-inch  furred tail. They’re nicknamed pack rats because they  collect sticks, prickly pear pads, cholla joints, and other  objects and pile them on their nests, which can get  quite large. Woodrats are especially attracted to shiny  and colorful objects, and you can recognize a pack rat  nest by the presence of candy wrappers, aluminum  cans, keys, and even pieces of broken glass. They will  also chew through wires on cars that are parked out- side for long periods to  add the colorful bits to  their nests. If a wood- rat starts building a  nest in an undesirable  place,  for  example  close to your house,  you can dismantle the nest and scatter the materials.  You’ll need to be persistent, as the rat will patiently re- construct the nest. Eventually, though, it will give up  and find another place for its nest. Woodrats eat juni- per berries and piñon nuts.  Keep the Critters Outside. House mice do exist here,  and the native mice may also try to move indoors dur- ing the cold months. To keep them from getting inside,  find and plug any openings in your house through  which they can enter. Typical places are cracks in the  foundation, openings in canales, gaps around roof pen- etrations like ventilation pipes, gaps in window and  door frames, dryer vents, and open chimneys. Caulk  gaps and holes. Mice can get through openings of less  than half an inch, so you should use steel wool or cop- per pot scrubber pads to stuff any openings too large  to caulk. Put a tight-fitting screen of ¼-inch hardware  cloth over chimney and dryer vent openings.  If you do get mice inside the house, you can use snap  traps to kill them humanely.  Poisons, rodenticides and            12   The GRIT – July 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 7    Mafic-nicent!  Stan Davis    In the June GRIT, I talked about “white” magmatic ge- ologic dikes in the Sandia Mountains and Rincon Hills  and Ridge. Those dikes are as ancient as the Sandia  Granite, number in the thousands, and are easy to see  even with casual observation. But the Sandias are also  host to “black” magmatic dikes, which are much  younger, much fewer in number, and are sometimes  easy to overlook. These rare “black” dikes seem anom- alous here, and certainly are “exotic” features  amongst all the light-colored granite.  These “black” dikes in the Sandias are mapped on  the NM Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources’ Ge- ologic Map of the Albuquerque – Rio Rancho metropoli- tan area and vicinity (S. Connell, 2008). This map classi- fies these dikes as “mafic,” which means they are rela- tively rich in dark-colored minerals, such as certain sili- cates and oxides that contain magnesium and iron.  However, the map legend further describes them as  being “mafic-to-intermediate” in composition, and  there is indeed some variation in their appearance in  the field. For simplicity I refer to these dikes as “black”  dikes, because many of them appear black, or dark  brown to gray. “Black” dikes occur mainly on the west- ern side of the Sandias, considerably downslope from  the Crest, in the middle-elevation ridges and even  down in the Open Spaces. Some “black” dikes criss- cross popular hike and bike trails, such as the 365, the  Mano Trail, the “Sandia Eye” trail and others. Some  “black” dikes with excellent exposures are located  close to Sandia Heights.  Whereas the Albuquerque Volcanoes are Pleisto- cene in Age, the “black” dikes are a little older—Oligo- cene. Many of the “black” dikes have a predominant  orientation that is generally north-south, which would  be consistent with Basin-and-Range-type crustal ex- pansion and rifting related to the formation of the Al- buquerque basin. My interpretation is that during very  early rifting stages of the Albuquerque basin, long  cracks opened up in the Sandia Granite and were filled  by mafic lavas. Some of these dikes are mapped for as  long as about half a mile or so, although following  these dikes continuously that far in the field can be  challenging, owing to erosion and the presence of veg- etation, granite boulders and gravels. Some of these  dikes are striking for how black they appear; fresh  faces glisten with crystals. Some of these dikes form lo- cal resistant ridges and ledges, while others erode  more easily down to ground level. Granted, the Sandia  “black” mafic dikes are not as magnificent as, for ex- ample, the dikes at Ship Rock. However, because they  are uncommon here, and mark the onset of a signifi- cant geologic event setting the stage for present-day  physiography in Albuquerque, they are in their own  way … “mafic-nicent”!      Portion of a large “black” dike near the junction of Old La Luz Trail and  Tramway Trail (FR333 or Tram terminal parking). This dike is close to San- dia Heights; it requires a short off-trail hike to reach, but it can be seen  from the trails without leaving them. The exposed portion of this dike has  broken apart into large boulders. A patina of desert varnish (manganese  oxide) appears to have made these rocks “extra” black. The inset shows a  closeup of sparkly coarse-grained texture on a fresh face.      Striking example of dark-colored mafic dike interfingering with light-col- ored Sandia Granite, forming stripes on the ground. This location is close to  a well-established, but “no-name,” trail that heads north out of Embudo  Arroyo (Indian School Road parking) up to Whitewash Trail and Ridge.  13 The GRIT – July 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 7 …continued from page 11  14   The GRIT – July 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 7  sticky traps are extremely cruel and inhumane, and we  strongly discourage using them. If you would like to  trap the mouse and release it outside, you can buy hu- mane box-type live traps at hardware stores.  Rodents sometimes chew drip irrigation lines, and  there’s a simple solution that will keep you from having  to repeatedly replace drip lines. If you think about why  the animals are chewing the lines, you’ll realize that  they’re after the water. Plastic drip hose is not a typical  menu item in the rodent world! Placing a saucer of wa- ter no more than two inches deep near the problem  area usually saves your drip system and keeps the ro- dents out of trouble.  If you park a vehicle outside, you may find mice or  woodrats chew wires or build nests under the hood.  Sometimes your first clue is the car won’t start! If you  cannot park the car in the garage, don’t leave it in the  same spot for long periods. Drive the car frequently,  move it to different parking spots, and check under the  hood regularly for signs that rodents have been busy.  Remove and scatter any nesting material you find.  Live and let live. Now that you’ve fortified your  house to keep rodents outside, leave them alone! They  belong here. This is their habitat. The native mouse  species eat insects in addition to seeds, so they’re an  important ally in keeping the insect population in bal- ance. They are also a food source for coyotes, bobcats,  foxes, hawks, owls, and snakes. Don’t set traps or use  poison bait outdoors! If you kill mice and rats that are  living outdoors, you’re only disrupting the food chain.  You can’t wipe them out, nor would you want to. Traps  set outside also kill unintended victims, like chipmunks  and birds. Poison bait sickens and kills other animals  when they eat a poisoned mouse or rat or if they eat  the poison directly, as raccoons and bears have been  known to do. Small doses can kill large animals, and a  rat or mouse generally eats enough at one feeding to  kill not only itself, but a predator that eats the dead or  dying rodent. Your pets can also die from eating a poi- soned rat or mouse, and it’s a slow, tortured death  from internal bleeding. Keep your pets and our wildlife  safe and don’t use poison bait!  We are fortunate to live in Sandia Heights in the  midst of a fascinating diversity of animal life. It’s up to  us to change our behavior to accommodate our wild- life. It may take getting used to a different way of think- ing, but making some changes in how we do things re- ally doesn’t inconvenience us very much. It’s worth the  effort to enjoy being part of a little bit of wildness and  to catch glimpses of our wild neighbors.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.     Sandia Heights Art Tour.
