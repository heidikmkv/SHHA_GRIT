She  has accepted a position with Sandia National Laboratories and is leaving  SHHA. We certainly wish her the best in her new job, but will miss her smil- ing face in the office. Angela has a second line of work making cupcakes.  So, you may still see her wares around from time to time.    Living with Bears  Adapted from City of Albuquerque information    The bears are still out and about, and probably will be until late November  or so. While black bears naturally avoid people, this changes if they grow  accustomed to eating human food or garbage. If we make it easy for bears  to access our garbage, they may choose this easy meal instead of foraging  for food in the wild. Bears are very intelligent and opportunistic animals.  A mother bear will teach her cubs to feed on garbage and they in turn will  teach their future cubs. This is how most human conflicts with bears arise,  resulting in the bears being labeled a “nuisance” even though the under- lying issue is often within human control.  Once a bear is perceived as a nuisance, that bear often ends up dead.  Homeowners can ask the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish to  trap the bear. Many trapped bears are then euthanized. Some are relo- cated, but bears don’t survive relocation well and often die in their new  environment. For both bear and human safety, see the tips on page 14 for  pro-active steps to prevent and deter bears from becoming attracted to  your property.              2   The GRIT – September 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 9      In a “Bind” Choosing A Contractor?   We’ve Got You!  Angela Moreno    Whether you are an HOA Member or not, it’s important  to note that you are still responsible for adhering to the  covenants that cover the unit in which you live. If you  are unfamiliar with the covenant guidelines for your  neighborhood, there are copies available in the office,  as well as online (Unit Covenants | Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (sandiahomeowners.org)).   As you know, there are several benefits afforded to  you as an SHHA member, one of which includes access  to the contractor evaluation binders in the office. The  binders contain feedback from your neighbors on con- tractors who have provided services for everything  from Air Conditioning to Windows. This is an incredibly  useful tool to help take some of the potential guess  work out of executing your home projects and we hope  that you will come by the office and utilize this service.  Also, if you have used a contractor that you would like  to provide feedback for, be sure to fill out an evaluation  form so that your neighbors can benefit from your ex- perience! (Contractor Evaluation Form | Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (sandiahomeowners.org))     A friendly reminder: Almost all exterior projects re- quire an ACC application & committee approval prior to  project commencement, so be sure to come by the of- fice for an application or complete one online (ACC Ap- plication | Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  (sandiahomeowners.org)). We look forward to seeing  you in the office soon!    Don’t miss it!  3   The GRIT – September 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 9  Continued on page 7…  The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell    This is it! The Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour will be  held September 9 & 10. Follow the signs to see the work  of fifty artists at 15 locations. This year marks the twen- tieth anniversary of this free event, and it is bigger than  ever. The artists, many of whom are award-winning, will  show their work, big and small, ranging from pottery to  painting, woodworking to wearable creations, and jew- elry to algorithm art, just to name a few. Come with cu- riosity and leave surprised at the range and quality of  the artists. You might find an irresistible piece to en- hance your home, to gift, or even to wear immediately.  The Sandia Heights artists proudly support La Mesa Arts  Academy, a free after-school program for students at La  Mesa Elementary School. For more information about  the Tour (or to download a brochure with a map) go to  the website at www.sandiaheightsartists.com.  This month I am featuring the current president of  the Sandia Heights Artists, Collin Delker, and the presi- dent-elect, Mara Malnekoff.    Collin Delker  When you look at an equation, or—if you are a com- puter engineer—a line of code, do you see color, com- position, design? In short, do you see art? Collin Delker  certainly does.  When asked if he had always had an artistic bent, Col- lin replied, “Sort of.” He related how he grew up in Kan- sas, active in his local 4-H chapter from ages 8 to 18. But  Collin was not raising cows or pigs: for ten years he was  learning photography. He learned composition, light,  color, contrast; and he loved it. Most of all he was learn- ing to recognize when a photograph had combined  those elements into a truly artistic work. When he was  not out taking photos, he was in his home basement  with his father, an engineering technology professor at  Kansas State University. There, working at his father’s  side, he would build electronic circuits and mobile ro- botic gadgets that would “drive the cat crazy.” He even  wrote computer code with his dad. “There was a picture  of me in diapers at my dad’s computer banging away at  the keyboard.” Naturally, Collin decided to study engi- neering—electrical engineering to be precise.  In grad school he wanted to learn Python, a coding  language often used for engineering. He was fascinated  with fractals and decided to use them as a tool to learn  Python. It was an engaging way to learn this new code.  During his study, he realized he could code his own orig- inal fractals, not just copy known patterns. The engi- neering seed that had been planted long ago and  nurtured through the practice of photographic princi- ples, blossomed into a new flower. “That was when I  came up with what could be considered a form of art  instead of just exercising computer coding. My study of  photography helped me evaluate if my results were  worth keeping.” Eventually, he had an “Aha” moment.  He coded an original image and when it appeared on the  screen he said, “Wow. That’s amazing!” That initial im- age created years ago has remained one of his favorites  and would become a best seller, but he was not even  printing out his results then.  Collin earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from  Purdue University. He received a temporary two-year  job offer at Sandia Labs and moved with his wife to Al- buquerque in 2013. While living in a rental home a few  miles away, they explored their new city and fell in love  with the spaciousness and natural setting of Sandia  Heights. In 2015, when the job turned into a permanent  position, they were determined to find a home in Sandia  Heights, and they soon did.  In 2020, entering the Covid lockdown period, Collin  began a deeper exploration into his original fractal im- ages. He posted them on social media. He investigated  various printing options, had some professionally  printed, and hung them in his new home. He had at- tended the Sandia Heights Artists Tour several times.  Collin decided to “take my art to a new level” and joined  the Sandia Heights Artists. “And a year later, they  wanted me to be their new president!” In 2021, he par- ticipated in the tour, showing his art for the first time to  the general public. He exhibited 10 of his unique images  printed on aluminum panels. “It was a little scary.” He  sold nine out of the ten.  Collin calls his compelling art form algorithm art. “I  am the artist. I write the algorithm that draws the im- age. After working with it for so many years, I can pretty  much direct where the work is going. Although, there  are some surprises.” He explained that “the hardest  part is knowing when it is done. The possibilities are lit- erally infinite. This is where my experience with photog- raphy comes in. I intuit when it is finished.”  Collin finds satisfaction in his synergistic simultane- ous blending of science, engineering, and art. “I derive  inspiration for my art from my daily work and my art in- spires my daily work. They play off each other. I am a  better engineer because I am an artist, and I am a better  artist because I am an engineer.”  Collin feels that he is “making visible a mathematical  world that is not routinely revealed but that informs the  world around us. Mathematics is the language of the  universe.  One  of  my  favorite things is,  after seeing my   4   The GRIT September 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 9  JULY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Mara Malnekoff  Most people think of clothing as just something to  wear, some as a style statement, but to Mara Malnekoff  clothing can make an artistic statement.  Mara grew up steeped in art in Chicago suburbs; both  parents were artistic. As a child she remembers going  into where her parents stored art supplies and “borrow- ing” them to make her own creations. She designed and  sewed for her Barbie dolls. She played dress-up with her  grandmother’s scarves, loving the drape and feel of the  silken fabric. Her grandfather taught at the Chicago Art  Institute. Visits with him were art immersions. No tele- vision—the children did art projects. “It was my fate: to  be creative. Now, when I cannot create, I feel lost.” The  die was cast: she would live an artistic life.  She has indeed. She earned BFAs from the University  of Illinois in art history and metalsmithing. Then at NYU  she earned a master’s in costume study and decorative  arts. She worked at museums and considered being a  curator. Life had other plans. In 1994, she moved with  her husband to Albuquerque where he pursued a medi- cal education at UNM. Mara worked as a registrar for  Judy Chicago, a renowned feminist artist, teacher, and  author. Mara and her husband grew to love the Albu- querque area with its dramatic mountain backdrop.  In 1996, they moved to Israel while her husband at- tended medical school in Tel Aviv. Mara worked as an  English tutor but continued to pursue her art interest  with a second job at the Shenkar Archive, where she had  jobs displaying historic clothing and creating a website.  After three years in Israel, they moved to San Francisco  where Mara continued to add to her skills—“my  toolbox” she calls it—with a job in website develop- ment. They moved yet again to St. Louis for her hus- band’s residency. Mara started creating her own art,  sewing creations while raising two young children.  In 2005, they happily relocated to Albuquerque for  her husband’s job at the New Mexico Cancer Center. In  time they found a home in Sandia Heights where they  really wanted to live because “there is something mag- netic about the mountain.” Her art could not be denied;  she started a part-time online business making her one- of-a-kind hats, clothing, and accessories. It evolved fol- lowing style trends, her interests, and a lot of experi- mentation. “I fundamentally believed that art could be  wearable. When a person wears something artistically  created, the person completes the art piece. It’s a to- tally different esthetic.”  However, Mara’s hunger for artistic expression is not  limited to wearables, not by a long shot! “That is a prob- lem for me because I love all the media!” To express an  idea, she reaches into her toolbox: ceramics, painting,  sculpture, glassblowing, printmaking, metalsmithing to  name a few. “I like to try different techniques. I can’t  limit myself. If someone tells me to try something, I will  most likely do it! I never want to stop learning.”  When asked to choose one medium, she thought a  moment and replied, “Fabric, probably, is my first love.  It has so many possibilities that other media do not, like  movement and texture. In my fabric creations, I follow  principles of harmony and composition common to all  art, but, uniquely, wearable fabric art needs someone to  wear it before it reaches its full artistic potential.”  Mara joined the Sandia Heights Artists in 2021. She  had made hundreds of Covid facemasks and needed to  turn back toward art. She wanted an art community. “I  decided to try it out.” That try-out became a commit- ment; she is now president-elect of the organization.   Asking Mara what she would like people to know  about her art she replied, “If you wear one of my crea- tions, you would be the only person in the world to have  it. I want to make you feel like you are a piece of art.”  Mara will be exhibiting at the Sandia Heights Artists’  Tour September 9 & 10.

But about 315 million years  ago—during the Pennsylvanian Period—something  else was industrious here as well—multitudes of shal- low marine invertebrates with the ability to extract  (precipitate out) calcium carbonate (calcite) from sea- water—constructing what would eventually become  layer upon layer of limestone. The Pennsylvanian was a  time of tectonic plate upheaval in the world, and much  of what would become North America during that time  suffered plate collisions on multiple sides. What would  eventually become New Mexico was not especially  close to these plate boundaries, but the crust here still  responded by gentle buckling and warping, and arches  of dry land and intervening shallow seas formed. Also,  at that time New Mexico sat astride the equator, and  multitudes of marine invertebrates thrived in warm  tropical waters.   The limestone cliffs on top of the Sandia Mountains  that can be seen from Sandia Heights are part of the  “Madera Group,” which consists of several different  recognized formations. The lower formations tend to  be the limestone-rich ones, and the limestone is often  referred to colloquially as the Madera Limestone. The  limestone is highly fossiliferous, although most of the  fossils are microscopic, and those that are visible tend  to be quite small and consist of broken up pieces. The  origin of all the limestone is essentially the tiny shells  and shell fragments that would remain after death and  decay of the organic parts of the original animals.  Some calcite (calcium carbonate) can also precipitate  out of solution in the seawater. With time, layer upon  layer of shells, shell fragments and precipitated calcite  would sink to the bottom of the seas, accumulate there  in layer upon layer, compress and eventually lithify to  form the limestone rock.  Sea levels were rising and falling abruptly and re- peatedly throughout the Pennsylvanian, and these sea- level fluctuations are linked to glaciation patterns in  the southern hemisphere at the time: sea levels rose  when glaciers melted, and sea levels fell when glaciers  grew in size. When sea levels were high, in New Mexico  the inland seas were actually still relatively “shallow”  compared to the truly deep oceans, and were hospita- ble to marine life. When sea levels were low, rivers and  streams on land could transport more sand, silt and  shale-sized particles (clastics) further out into the seas:  this influx of clastic sediments essentially “muddied”  the otherwise clear tropical waters and suppressed  marine invertebrate populations, resulting in the dep- osition of sediments that would eventually become  shales, siltstones and sandstones. In short, glacial peri- ods waxed and waned repeatedly, causing sea levels to  fall and rise in response, resulting in cyclic layering pat- terns between more clastic (shaly) layers and more cal- cium carbonate-rich (limestone) layers.   Let’s “fast forward” to a more recent time during  and after the formation of the Albuquerque Basin and  relative uplift of the Sandia Mountains. Now the  Madera rocks on the upthrown sides of the basin- bounding faults have been exposed to wind, rain and  running water at the surface, resulting in erosion. How  rocks weather and erode is very much a function of  how “hard” they are. Generally, in the relatively arid  American West, limestones tend to resist erosion,  forming cliffs and ledges. Conversely shales, or rocks  that are at least shaly (“muddy”), tend to erode more  easily, forming slopes. Hence, overall cliff faces that  contain alternating layers of rock types will often con- sist of alternating steep cliffs/ledges and gentler  slopes.       View looking north along the uppermost La Luz Trail, below the Ki- wanis Cabin, showing the overall cliff is composed of alternating ero- sion-resistant limestone layers forming cliffs and more erosion- prone shaly layers forming more vegetated slopes. This alternation  of layers is linked to glaciation cycles elsewhere at the time, affect- ing the rise and fall of sea level globally.    12   The GRIT – September 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 9  Beware: Don’t Use Rodent Poison!    Some property owners in Sandia Heights are installing  outdoor poisoned-bait rodent traps. This method of  pest control is detrimental to the environment because  of the traps’ indiscriminate ability to kill animals other  than the rodents they target. After ingesting poison in  these traps, the rodents die and might be consumed by  larger wildlife, which in turn become ill from the poi- son.  Predatory birds, such as hawks and owls, are partic- ularly susceptible to secondary poisoning and often die  as a result. These birds are precisely the predators who  keep the rodent population down, as do coyotes and  bobcats which might also eat poisoned rodents. Your  pets may be vulnerable; poisoned rodents will not die  next to the bait traps on your property, but will travel  to other yards where they will possibly die and be  eaten by cats and dogs.  SHHA does not recommend poisoning rodents, due  to risks of environmental contamination. We recom- mend keeping your property clean and free of rats’  nests and trapping and removing rodents or using snap  traps inside structures. As a resident, if you decide to  use bait traps, you are responsible for promptly picking  up and disposing of all dead animals on your property.  You must then inform all of your surrounding neigh- bors of your use of bait traps. You must know the spe- cific poison used in the traps so that, should a pet be- come ill, an antidote can be administered quickly. Bet- ter yet, don’t use poisoned bait traps.  Many residents chose to live in Sandia Heights be- cause of opportunities to see wildlife and appreciate  an environment outside the city. Your choice of pest  control should not destroy what others appreciate  most. Please be considerate of both people and wild- life.    2024 SHHA Resident Guide & Directory  Deadline    Please check your alphabetical listing as well as your  numerical listing in the 2023 Resident Guide and Direc- tory and let the SHHA office know if you have any  changes or additions. If you do not wish your name  and/or phone number to be printed in the Directory  you will be listed as “Resident” and your phone num- ber will not be displayed. All changes must be received  on or before Friday, November 3rd, 2023, in order to be  included in the 2024 Resident Guide and Directory.  Bernalillo County Code   for Prohibited Uses in a   Single-Family Residential Zone  Covenant Support Committee    Bernalillo County Codes and Ordinances are often  more up-to-date and more restrictive than the Sandia  Heights Covenants, which in some instances were writ- ten over 50 years ago. SHHA covenant complaints filed  in our office cannot be acted upon by the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) if there is not specific lan- guage in that particular unit’s covenants which prohib- its the alleged violation. SHHA does not own the cove- nants and cannot change them—only the residents of  a particular unit can change that unit’s covenants.  In such instances where  Bernalillo County Codes and  Ordinances may apply, the  CSC will refer the homeowner  to check the County for use re- strictions.  For example, a few  of the early covenants do  cover open storage on resi- dential lots. The following is  copied from the Bernalillo County Code, Appendix A– Zoning, Section 9-R-1 Single Family Residential:  1. The following uses are prohibited in this zone:  a. The open storage of inoperable vehicles or auto  parts;  b. The open storage of trash or junk;  c. The open storage of large appliances;  d. Any use not designated a permissive use or con- ditional use in this zone, unless otherwise au- thorized by this Code; or  e. Any use not recognized as customarily incidental  to a permitted use in the zone.

A fed bear is a dead bear.  • Keep trash bins stored in a sturdy metal shed or  closed garage. Put out garbage only on morning  of pickup.  • Don’t feed pets outdoors or leave pets’ dishes or  store pet food outdoors.  • Hang seed bird feeders from wires between trees  high enough off the ground that a bear can’t reach  them. Bring in hummingbird feeders at night. Feed  suet and peanut butter only in winter when bears  are hibernating. Store birdseed in a closed con- tainer in a sturdy shed or enclosed garage.    • Keep barbeque grills clean.  • Keep kitchen windows and doors closed on sum- mer nights.  • Don’t plant fruit trees or berry bushes near your  home. Remove fruit before it ripens to stop bears  climbing and breaking branches. Remove fallen  fruit. Don’t add fruit or melon rinds to compost  pile except in winter.  • Don’t leave food, groceries, pet food or birdseed  in your car overnight.  • Don’t feed other wildlife as it will also attract  bears.  • If a bear is drinking from your swimming pool, hot  tub or water feature, put some water out as far  from your house and neighbors’ homes as possi- ble.   • Keep all poisons inside your house. Also, many  bears die from ingesting garbage bags.  • Keep woodpiles and junk away from the house.  Bears will hunt for rodents that live there.    Cwazy Wabbit!
