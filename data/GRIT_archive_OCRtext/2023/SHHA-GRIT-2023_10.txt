We always  welcome new people stepping up to volunteer responsibilities. (Hint.  Hint.) This month, we’d like to let you know of three changes.  Architectural Control Committee chair. Phil Krehbiel has stepped up to  take the lead with the ACC. Phil is an attorney and will be a great asset  heading this very important committee. Phil is replacing David Crossley.  Under David’s leadership, the Architectural Guidelines became enforce- able “community documents” to better maintain the ambience we all love  about Sandia Heights. Thank you, David, for your hard work.  Covenant Support Committee chair. Arthur Romero came on the  Board to help keep Sandia Heights in conformance with the covenants.  Now, as the CSC chair, he will be doing just that. Welcome, Arthur. At the  same time, we bid farewell to long-serving Bob Thomas. Bob has been in  this often-stressful lead position for six years. Let’s give Bob a pat on the  back as he heads off to the East Mountains.  GRIT editor. I have been editing The GRIT for five and a half years. This  is my last edition. It has been a privilege and a good bit of fun to work with  the talented people who submit articles for our monthly newsletter—and  also a creative challenge filling any remaining white space each month!  Kevin Lloyd will be taking the reins henceforth. Kevin’s day job in video  production is perfect for taking The GRIT in new and interesting directions.  Lastly, there is a new face in the SHHA office. Holly Sylvester is the new  office administrator. If you have a chance, stop by and say “hello” and  “welcome” to Holly.    2   The GRIT – October 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 10    Dogs on the loose!    A quick perusal of postings on social media, NextDoor  especially, shows the problems that arise when our  dogs are not confined or restrained: runaway and lost  dogs, dogs hit by cars, and dogs harming other animals  or people.  Recently, here in Sandia Heights, a small dog walking  on leash with its person was attacked and killed by two  large neighborhood dogs on the loose. By law, we are  required to keep our animals from running at large and,  moreover, to restrain them when they are not confined.  Bernalillo County Code §6-51. Animals running at large.  (a) It is unlawful for a person to allow or permit any an- imal to run at large in or on any alley, street, sidewalk,  vacant lot, public property, other unenclosed place in  the county, or private property without the permis- sion of the property owner.  (b) An animal permitted to run at large in violation of  this section is declared to be a nuisance and a menace  to the public health and safety. Such animal may be  taken up and impounded. An animal care services of- ficer may go upon private property in pursuit of an  animal which is running at large unless permission to  make such pursuit is explicitly refused by the occu- pant. An officer may not enter a private building or  residence in pursuit of an animal. (Ord. of 2-26-13)  State Law reference—Authority to prohibit the run- ning at large of animals, NMSA 1978, §§ 4-37-1, 3-18- 3(A)(2), 77-1-12; Dangerous Dog Act, NMSA 1978, §§  77-1A-1 to 77-1A-6.  BCC § 6-43. Restraint of animals.  (a)(1) A person owning or having charge, custody, care,  or control over a companion animal, shall keep the  animal upon his or her own premises within a secure  enclosed pen, or in an area containing a fence or wall  of sufficient height surrounding the perimeter of the  property. It shall be unlawful to tether a companion  animal as a form of confinement. (Ord. of 2-26-13).  But even if we do keep our dogs safely confined, our  duty to control them does not stop there:  §6-43.(a)(2) A dog is permitted on the street and in  other public places only if on a secure leash not ex- ceeding six feet in length. Longer retractable leashes  may be used, provided the person with the dog is ca- pable of controlling the dog… A person physically ca- pable of controlling and restraining the animal must  exercise immediate custody. This section does not  apply when … a dog is in an off-leash park or other  designated off-leash area.”   (By the way, there are no designated dog parks or off- leash areas in Sandia Heights.)  It is important that either your dog is well trained, on  a leash, or you are stronger than your dog. Although re- tractable leashes are legal, they are rarely a good idea  and create problems of their own. There have been  many reports of retractable leashes malfunctioning  over time, either failing to extend or to retract, or un- spooling at will or breaking apart from the handle. While  you may think you are capable of controlling your dog  on a retractable leash, an 80-pound lab with a 15+ foot  head start is very hard indeed to stop. Your dog can  lunge so fast that when he reaches the end of the leash,  he gets a strong jolt that can cause him serious throat,  neck or shoulder injuries. Retractable leashes can also  cause bodily injury to the operator and anyone in the  surrounding area. The cord on a retractable leash is thin  and can easily get wrapped around fingers or legs caus- ing injuries ranging from minor rope burn and skin lac- erations to amputation of a digit. A dog at the end of an  extended retractable leash can quickly entangle people  in the surrounding area and cause them to trip or fall  and harm themselves. A while back, on the Tramway  bike path, a small dog uncontrolled on a retractable  leash tangled with an oncoming bicycle, resulting in se- rious injury for the biker and death for the dog.  Don’t think that you can avoid leash problems by  walking with your dog off leash. You may think your off- leash dog is under your control, but what if you run into  a bunny or deer or coyote or another dog? Chances are  that your good dog is long gone before you can react.    3   The GRIT – October 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 10  Continued on page 11…  The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell    The 20th annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour was  held September 9 & 10. The tour was heralded by a  KHFM classical radio interview of participating artist  Mary Ellen Merrigan (featured in the July “The Artist  Next Door”) on September 7 and an Albuquerque Jour- nal front-page banner, plus an ad in the “Venue” enter- tainment section. A display during August at the Sun- port promised: “1500+ artworks. 50 artists. ONE good  time.” Publicity efforts were expanded this year to in- clude television and social media. KRQE graciously  worked with the team to produce commercial spots  throughout the preceding week during the morning  news on KRQE Channel 13, plus an interview on KRQE  Channel 2 “New Mexico Living” on September 8 with  Mary Ellen Merrigan accompanied by participating art- ist, Marianne Bettinger. Social media generated excite- ment with interviews and announcements to ever-in- creasing followers. The artists even made great use of  the humble postcard, with mailings to more zip codes.   The committees and participating artists prepared  diligently to make each of the fifteen stops easy to find,  interesting, and—of course—full of original art from  painting to pottery; glass work to woodwork; collage to  clothing, to name just a few.   Everyone was too busy to meet the deadline for this  October issue. “The Artist Next Door” will continue in  November, as usual, with more artist interviews.     What is a Tutor Doctor?  Elizabeth Edgren, Community Service & Membership  chair    Observant readers of The GRIT know that on page 8 is a  table of businesses that offer special deals to SHHA  members who show their membership key tag. A busi- ness we used to see there was Tutor Doctor. I wanted  to know more about this, so I looked at the website and  met with Byron Zahm.   In 2019, Byron bought the Albuquerque franchise of  Tutor Doctor (established in 2011), a worldwide enter- prise operating in 16 countries, offering individual, cus- tomized tutoring for any age student in any subject. He  himself is not the tutor although his own story is full of  educating, from being a homeschool dad of seven, to  being 20 years an Outdoor Experiential Educator. He  now runs this local business that employs several dozen  tutors from a wide range of credentials and experience.   Who calls Tutor Doctor for help? Parents of elemen- tary through high school students, parents of children  needing special accommodations, undergrad and grad- uate university students, professionals and would-be  professionals preparing for professional certifications.  Currently, Byron’s students range from four to 87 years  old. From spelling to the SAT to the GRE, from master- ing the essentials to pass a test to personal enrichment,  it sounds like no educational pursuit is outside Tutor  Doctor’s purview. If someone calls for help in a particu- lar subject for which Byron has no current tutor, he goes  searching for someone with just the right credentials to  join the team and help that new client. He is continually  recruiting.   This is just one way Tutor Doctor’s service is custom- ized. A student does not get just “a math tutor,” but  someone matched especially to the student and their  particular learning needs and goals. A student will meet  one-on-one with their own tutor, building a strong,  trusting relationship conducive to learning. Student and  tutor will use the student’s own texts and materials to  ensure the student meets the standards by which  he/she is being measured. Byron says that as each stu- dent is unique, so the assistance he receives will be  unique. Tutoring typically take place in the student’s  own home (providing an adult is present in the home  throughout the session). Occasionally, if needed, ses- sions may be held in a public setting, such as a library.   What can you expect when you call on Tutor Doctor?  First, a personal consultation between student and par- ent(s) and Byron. He listens to the needs and concerns  of both parents and students, and will answer any ques- tions. Tutor Doctor also offers the MindPrint cognitive  skills assessment (the one NASA uses in their astronaut  program). Assessment results translate to recom- mended learning strategies personalized for your stu- dent. By understanding how a student processes infor- mation, Tutor Doctor can help students gain greater ac- ademic success because they can learn in ways that  align with their unique learner profile. (https://www.tu- tordoctor.com/albuquerque/tutoring-ser- vices/mindprint-cognitive-skills-assessment/ )   Byron readily acknowledges that Tutor Doctor is not  the cheapest tutoring service in town nor is it the most  expensive, but he earnestly believes it is a great value,  with the best results. Fees vary, based on the tutor’s tal- ent and experience, and the frequency and duration of  sessions. Prioritizing the student’s needs helps clients  get the best return on their investment.  Who are the tutors? They are high school graduates  to college students to Ph.D.s to retired professionals.  Tutor Doctor works not only to improve its clients’ skills,  But, also, to build the skills of its tutors, offering them  no-cost skills certification.  4   The GRIT October 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 10  AUGUST CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Deer & Apache Plume  Connie Welty              Your Monthly Recommendation    The Elephant Vanishes by Haruki Murakami.     Murakami, a savant of surrealism, compiles a series of  seventeen short stories for your perusal. In this 1993  compilation of stories originally published between  1980 and 1991, Murakami’s work continues to influence  pop culture into the present. The story “Barn Burning”  was the basis for the 2018 film Burning which com- peted for the Palm d’Or. It is listed at number 13 in Hol- lywood Reporter’s top 50 films of this century and has  come to be recognized as one of the best Korean-pro- duced films of all time.   The collection also features the story, “The Wind-up  Bird and Tuesday’s Women.” Though fairly concise as  published, it would later spawn The Wind-Up Bird  Chronicle, a monolithic, nearly 1400-page epic. Pub- lished in 1997, it is often regarded as Murakami’s great- est work, but has its origins in the short story.  The compilation is an excellent introduction to Mu- rakami, subjectively the most famous living Japanese  novelist. If you can embrace uncertainty in your read- ing, then you may find something for you in Mura- kami’s The Elephant Vanishes.     Do you have a recommendation? Book, movie,  restaurant, shop, ....

Those of us here  for years have thoroughly enjoyed the bears, and we  know what to expect. The NM Department of Game  and Fish has been no friend of us residents and our  friends the bears. The bears should not be trapped,  moved, or killed. Hopefully there has been no SHHA  complicity in past or present, and will be no SHHA com- plicity in the future, with the NMG&F in any trapping,  moving or killing.   I was also happy to see the article in regard to ro- dent poisoning. While we have mice visit us in our  home, we have never had a pack rat in the home. Pack  rats create some havoc with cactus, but if anyone  would uncover their living quarters one will see that  they are extremely clean animals with marvelously fine  sleeping beds.    Jonathan Sutin    Please Obey Stop Signs    The office has received complaints of people running  through neighborhood stop signs. In particular, there  seems to be an issue with people not stopping at the  signs around Tennyson,  the parallel road west of  Tramway. Some drivers  are  ignoring  other  neighborhood  stop  signs as well. Some  hardly slow down. This  is dangerous. Obey the  law. The signs are there  for a reason. And don’t  forget to drive at or below the posted speed limits. For  one thing, it’s easier to stop at a stop sign if you’re not  going so fast!    Fun Fact    Many of us know some of New Mexico’s symbols:  Flag symbol: zia  Bird: roadrunner  Tree: piñon  Flower: yucca  Animal: NM black bear  Vegetable: chile and pinto beans  Cookie: biscochito   Gem: turquoise  Fish: cutthroat trout  Insect: tarantula hawk  Grass: blue grama  Amphibian: spadefoot toad  Fossil: Coelophysis  But have you ever heard New Mexico’s state motto?  The official motto of New Mexico is Crescit eundo, Latin  for “It grows as it goes.” Well, okay then….   According to Wikipedia, the motto’s source is the  epic poem De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things)  by first-century BCE Latin poet Lucretius. It refers to a  thunderbolt increasing in strength as it moves across  the sky, a symbol of dynamic progress.          15   The GRIT – October 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 10  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Cork & Fork has resumed having bimonthly dinners. We  gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts.  The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of  the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are two whole-group dinners during the year. All  adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Rene Kessel at (505)  504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.     Sandia Heights Studio Art Tour.
