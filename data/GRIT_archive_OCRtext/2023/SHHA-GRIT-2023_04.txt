Already a Brush Fire Near the Foothills?  By Susan McCasland  On March 9 as I was driving south on Tramway, I spotted smoke that ap- peared to be from High Desert or Glenwood Hills. I then tried to track  down the smoke. It was considerably south of my initial estimate, being in  the Four Hills area or maybe the mouth of Tijeras pass. March 9 may seem  way too early for brush fires, but it’s not. On that same drive home from  the airport, I’d passed another fire burning right beside I-25. Please be  careful with fire: cigarettes, fireworks, barbeques, parking hot catalytic  converters over dry grass. It doesn’t take much to cause what could be- come a catastrophic fire.  And, by the way, the fire shown below that I was tracking down Tram- way turned out to be a prescribed burn near Kirtland. Phew!      2   The GRIT – April 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 4    Save Elena Gallegos Open Space  Current Status  Environment and Safety Committee    Lawsuit Status. The “Save the Elena Gallegos” (STEG)  nonprofit and eighteen citizen plaintiffs filed a lawsuit  against the City of Albuquerque (CABQ) on December  22, 2022, to uphold the deed to the Elena Gallegos Open  Space, which prohibits buildings on the land. On Febru- ary 23, 2023, the City responded and filed a motion for  summary judgment in the City’s favor on the grounds  that citizens cannot enforce the deed because citizens  “are not the intended beneficiary” of the deed. STEG is  in the process of filing a cross-motion for summary judg- ment in the plaintiffs’ favor that they have a standing to  enforce the deed. STEG believes they have an extremely  strong legal case; the deed is unequivocal in prohibiting  buildings, and who, if not citizens, would be the in- tended beneficiary of the deed? However, they can’t  know how the case will unfold, which is why they con- tinue to grow the social movement.  CABQ Parks Open Space Status. Dennis Vasquez,  Deputy Director of Albuquerque Parks and Recreation,  provided an update on the City’s activity. He is not  aware of any upcoming public meetings but says these  are planned. There were a number of public meetings  advertised by Groundwork Studio regarding EGOS.  These were cancelled at the request of the City of Albu- querque and are not currently rescheduled.  In March, a study of Simms Road was completed by  Parametrix Engineering and is being reviewed by CABQ.  The Parametrix study was requested to look at “improv- ing bicycle safety on Simms Road.” Funding and road re- vision, if decided on, will be han- dled through the Department of  Municipal Development. So far  there are no public meetings  scheduled on this.  There is a habitat impact  study ongoing to look at the im- pact of development within  Elena Gallegos. This is being  conducted by Tetra Tech, which  is an international municipal en- vironmental engineering firm.  CABQ is also planning to do a  current use survey of the entire  foothills park system to include  EGOS, likely a survey of open  space users. After all of the  above surveys are completed, the City will review and  potentially revise their plan. They plan to have public in- put, however there is no set timeline on this yet.  Call for Action. The Elena Gallegos Open Space, adja- cent to the National Forest, is a tremendous asset to  both Sandia Heights and the broader communities, and  should remain as natural and unchanged from its origi- nal natural state as possible. Bringing crowds in buses,  expanding Simms Rd, and constructing buildings and  parking lots will destroy the natural habitat and open  space and overcrowd an already heavily used trail sys- tem, resulting in more abuse, noise, traffic and crime in  our neighborhood, and erode the quality of life we so  appreciate in Sandia Heights.   Each of us can play an important role in supporting  the deed restriction and making our voice heard, by be- ing informed and signing the petition (see next section),  by contacting others and letting them know what is  happening, by contacting City leaders or influential peo- ple within Albuquerque city and/or Bernalillo County,  and voicing our concerns. Building a single building es- tablishes a precedent regarding future building in Elena  Gallegos.  How can you take a more active role in preventing  the development of the education center? You can sup- port the cause by signing and sharing STEG’s petition  (which now has more than 11,000 signatures) at  change.org/saveelenagallegos  or by displaying a “Save  the Elena Gallegos” sign in your yard. Email  saveelenagallegos@gmail.com to request one. You can  also join the STEG Google Group to be notified of ongo- ing opportunities and requesting to be added to their  group by emailing saveelenagallegos@gmail.com.    3   The GRIT – April 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 4    Reminders from Your Covenant   Support Committee    Room Rental. Big house? Feeling lonely? Want to meet  new folks? There are many ways to satisfy this need, but  doing an Airbnb or room rental is not one of them. It is  tempting to rent out that extra bedroom in order to  make extra money. However, your covenants do not  permit this.  Short-term rentals also create concerns about main- taining security in your neighborhood. As a short-term  landlord, you are inviting transient renters into the area,  which may pose a threat to your neighbors. The Sandia  Heights Security Patrol, available by subscription, does  a great job of patrolling and looking for unfamiliar cars  in your area. But by doing short-term rentals, you make  their job much more difficult.  If you have your home listed as a daily room rental,  please immediately remove your listing. If your neigh- bor is involved in room rental, please file a covenant  complaint so that we may investigate.    Trash Cans. Trash containers visible from the street  are a major source of complaints. The trash bins should  be wheeled behind a fence or screen or put in the gar- age. The containers may be put out on the day before  collection in the late afternoon, although it is far better  to put them out the morning of pick up because of scav- enging bears. Bins must be stored out of sight after the  trash is picked up. At some times of year, we also gen- erate more paper and boxes than will fit into our recycle  bins. If this is your case, consider using some of the off- site recycle bins throughout the city (found on the  BernCo web site) or divide the load up for two pickup  cycles. You can also call Sandia Heights Services and ask  what other options, such as a special pickup, can be ar- ranged.    Parking. Most of our covenants address cars that  have not moved from a lot or driveway in some time or  that are unlicensed. These may be a covenant violation  which the CSC will investigate. However, we do get  complaints about cars parked on the street or in com- munal parking areas as well. The CSC does not handle  these parking issues and they should be referred to the  Sheriff’s Department. SHHA does not have the author- ity to enforce parking on Bernalillo County roads or  common areas. The Sheriff can and will tow cars at the  owner’s expense. Once towed, it may be difficult or ex- pensive to reclaim your car, so be mindful of where you  park.  Weeds and RVs. The summer will be here soon. It is  the time for weeds to grow on your lawn and RVs, trail- ers, campers, boats, etc. to grow in your driveway. From  handling complaints from your neighbors, it is apparent  that a lot of folks are unaware that they agreed to abide  by covenants when they bought or rented their homes.  If you are not sure what your covenants say, stop by the  SHHA office for a copy or look them up on the SHHA  website.  This brings us to weeds—especially if you have peb- bles in your front yard. It seems like weeds grow by  inches overnight. If you don’t keep up with them, they  become overwhelming. If you treat them like eating an  elephant (a little at a time) you wouldn’t have to resort  to an herbicide or to letting your property go to seed.  Again, it’s a good neighbor thing—keeping property  values up.    Covenant Enforcement. We often get complaints in- volving annoyances, safety issues, or nuisances. Some- times these involve enforcement of county codes or or- dinances (e.g., barking dogs, traffic, parking on the  street, excessive or all-night lighting, etc.). When you  file these complaints we do investigate them, but you  may receive a letter instructing you to contact the  County for enforcement. The CSC does not have author- ity or ability to handle many of these issues.  Please understand that SHHA is not a property man- agement organization. It is staffed by volunteers (other  than our hard-working office staff) and we have very  few people that want to help us and work on commit- tees. So, it takes some time for the CSC to do investiga- tions and resolve issues. The 38 different sets of cove- nants, one for each Unit, are far from perfect; however,  only Unit owners can change them.  Speaking of the office staff—when you come to the  office, we know that sometimes you may be frustrated  and may want something done about your problem and  want it done now. Please, don’t take your frustrations  out on the staff. Try to be respectful; they are there to  be helpful and don’t deserve abuse.    4   The GRIT April 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 4  FEBRUARY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, is a video  worth millions? I have posted videos at the link below to  see night life of the Western Screech Owls (WESO) be- ginning to nest in our area. Unfortunately, the videos  also show a not-so-positive ending. The link is  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1poD- fOi1ZcehXoqLhXMv04YMEBHRysPyi?usp=sharing  (Click on the video you would like to watch, then click  on the small “screen” that comes up on the right side of  the page.) Notice in video 4 at about 1 min 25 sec, you’ll  see a WESO return to the nest with a mouse. They can  eat up to 5 mice a night.  The owl/raptor nesting project started in Sandia  Heights in October 2022. The intent is to help promote  wildlife and residents’ interface living. We are fortunate  that we live in an area with close proximity to wildlife  and have an opportunity to observe their behaviors. The  project is meant to supply nests in areas that attract rap- tors and to monitor status and trends in nesting: the  numbers of eggs laid, how many hatchlings survive, etc.  The project only succeeds with your input and everyone  working together as a community. It requires residents  to adopt a more natural approach to pest control and a  willingness to abandon any use of rodenticide or poison  to kill mice and rats.  Known worldwide, owls are beneficial as natural  predators in their habitats and surrounding ecosystems.   For humans, they help control prey like mice and rats  that sometimes can be considered nuisances or pests  around homes.  Also known worldwide with research validation, ro- denticides are not single-use in an area where so many  of our wildlife rely on the targeted pests as a food  source. Using poisons disrupts the local food chain. Yes,  we still see wildlife in Sandia Heights, but the numbers  and frequency have significantly declined in the past 20  years. Regrettably, remaining wildlife will soon disap- pear if we continue to upset the natural food chain.  They belong here; this is their habitat.  Suggestions for your community support:  •  Stop using all poisons outside your home.    •  Use wire mesh to close off any openings you sus- pect are allowing the mice/rats inside. Mesh  should be 1/4" or less.  •  Get a cat or dog. They will let you know where  the mice and rats are, making them easy to trap.  •  Use a trap-and-release method, or use spring- loaded mouse/rat traps and kill the mice. Leave  the live rodents or carcasses outside in a remote  location. Hungry wildlife will eventually find and  eat them nightly. I know several residents do this  and every couple of days the dead rodents are  gone.  I’ll continue to monitor the nests and provide up- dates with information at the link above. As of March  10th, no owls have returned to the nests. It is a sensitive  balance, and I encourage you to be an advocate for our  wildlife through your actions. If you have any questions  or difficulties with the link, please contact me at diane- barney@gmail.com.

The parkland area in Albuquerque  is 23% of the total area of the city or 42.9 square miles  (111 square kilometers). This percentage of park area is  one of the highest of the United States’ large cities.  Around 82% of the residents of Albuquerque city reside  within easy walking distance of a city park. The total  area of the city of Albuquerque is about 188.9 sq mi  (489 sq km).  Here are pictures of some parks in Albuquerque.

By Susan McCasland    A resident recently contacted the SHHA office, con- cerned about seeing open mailboxes and the implied  theft of their contents. I took the opportunity at the  recent Annual Meeting of discussing this topic with Mr.  John Shorey, the Operations Manager for Sandia  Heights Security. His suggestions were as follows:  • Install a locking mailbox  • Sign up for a post office box  • If you know you’re going to be gone and have some- thing of value arriving, arrange for it to be delivered  to a neighbor who will be home  And I’d like to add one other:  • If you are mailing something of value, such as a  check, take it to the post office and use the indoor  mail slots. Mail thieves can use sticky tape to fish let- ters out of the outdoor drive-by boxes!  When our mail was stolen a few years ago (thief got  a used paperback and a rotary dog-nail grinder—both  well known as high-value items with local fences), we  opted for the locking mailbox. In researching them, I  learned that you want one that is sturdy and also won’t  allow someone’s arm to reach inside to grab the deliv- ered mail. And it needs to be mounted such that a swift  whack with a baseball bat doesn’t dismount the box.  As always, neighbors watching out for neighbors  goes a long way in deterring would-be criminals. But it  hardly takes any time at all to open a mailbox and grab  the contents. Also, get to know your mail carrier’s  usual delivery time to your mailbox, and retrieve your  mail as soon as possible.  If you do decide to install a locking mail box, get one  approved by the U.S. Postal Service and then file an ap- plication with SHHA’s Architectural Control Commit- tee. Applications are available on the website or in the  office.

However, there is a distinctive, recognized geologic  formation called the Sandia Formation “sandwiched”  between. It is the Pennsylvanian-age Sandia For- mation that rests directly on the Great Unconformity  that marks the top of the Proterozoic (“Precam- brian”) Granite. The Sandia Formation contains color- ful, layered sandstones and conglomerates that are  mostly marine in origin—consisting of sediments orig- inally laid down on the near shoreline and Continental  Shelf.    The Sandia Formation can be seen in cliff faces for  a short distance along the Crest Highway near the  Cienega/Sulfur picnic area turnoff. The Formation oc- curs here at relatively low elevation due to complex  faulting in the East Mountains; otherwise, you have to  hike up high and long distances to find it. But there are  reasons why the Sandia Formation may often go un- noticed by a hiker. The Sandia Formation is not very  thick, certainly compared to the overlying limestone  and underlying granite. Where the topography is  steep on the western side of the mountains, for exam- ple along the upper stretch of the Pino Trail, the lateral  extent of the Sandia Formation is relatively short and  easy to miss. What’s more, thick vegetation, forest  soils and limestone debris that has rolled downhill  from above may also conceal the formation from  view.  There are places where a coincidence of gently tilt- ing rock strata and gently inclining eroded ground sur- face has exposed the Sandia Formation along some  portions of trails so you can hike right on top of it.  Good examples are short stretches along the upper La  Luz and South Peak trails. But the longest stretch of  Sandia Formation in the mountains exists along a part  of the South Crest Trail. This part of the Trail is the  southernmost extent that is still located at relatively  high elevation in a sparse Ponderosa zone. Here, long,  gentle switchbacks will take you hiking across the San- dia Formation for an hour or so, depending on  whether you are going uphill or down. A brief uphill  departure from the trail above the junction with the  Hawk Watch Trail will take you to a stunning setting  not seen anywhere else along the edge of the Crest,  where the colorful Sandia Formation forms the west- ern facing edge of the Crest, as shown below.     View looking north along the literal edge of the South Crest, standing on colorful Sandia Formation sandstone, which has  been exposed in a wide swath due to the overlying Madera Limestone having been eroded away  15   The GRIT – April 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 4  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.
