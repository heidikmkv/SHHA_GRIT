This year HBO's Last  Week Tonight dedicated a full episode to the subject, offering a critical  perspective that quickly gained traction on social media, amassing just un- der 6 million views on YouTube at the time of this writing. Additionally,  CNBC aired a segment last month, broadly accusing American HOAs of  abusive meddling, the excessive issuance of fines, and general overreach.  The main argument in favor of HOAs, as presented by the recent CNBC  segment, is that they preserve or increase home values within their com- munities, according to some estimates, by as much as 4%. Contrasting  studies suggest that the majority of homes within HOAs are valued less  than neighboring properties outside of them. It's worth noting that HOAs  can also manage community property and shared amenities, normally del- egated to local government, which of course provides value.  So, how does SHHA differentiate itself from typical HOAs, and how does  it steer clear of the negative reputation tied with these associations else- where? In contrast to many HOAs that delegate day-to-day operations to  for-profit businesses, SHHA operates under the governance of an entirely  uncompensated board of directors comprised of volunteer residents. As  a non-profit entity, our dues remain notably low, currently set at $15 per  month as of this writing. Unlike profit-driven HOAs, we are not motivated  to aggressively collect fines, opting to address covenant violations only  when a formal complaint has been filed.  In instances where actions negatively impact the community, such as  erecting a disruptive light or constructing a non-compliant garage, en- croaching on an easement, we endeavor to address the issue for the bet- terment of the community, without a financial incentive. While this ap- proach is ideal for non-monetary reasons, it can pose a strain on our re- sources when we must act to address complaints.  If you are passionate about upholding the positive reputation of SHHA,  we invite you to consider applying to join our board of directors.

Lack of rainfall,  combined with high temperatures, caused some of our  neighborhood’s ponderosas, pinons, and junipers to die off.  Dead trees have much lower moisture than live trees, and  burn more readily. As they burn fast and hot, they are more  likely to throw “firebrands” - bunches of embers that can be  carried by the wind for miles. Embers land in other trees, set- ting them on fire, and can be blown onto roofs, under eaves,  porches and decks, quickly setting houses on fire. This is how  wildfires spread so rapidly to a wide area.    Simply put: dead trees throughout our community put San- dia Heights’ homes at increased risk for a catastrophic wild- fire. If there is a dead tree on your property, you are required  by the neighborhood covenants and Bernalillo County ordi- nances to remove it. Now is the perfect time to cut and re- move dead trees because the Pine Bark Beetle is less able to  move from the dead pines to infest live trees in cold weather.    If you decide to replace the tree, you might want to consult  the “NM Climate-Ready Tree Lists” for trees that can thrive  in the warmer, drier climate coming our way, along with the  ACC Design Guideline for Landscaping. Any trees or major  landscaping changes to your property requires approval  from the Architectural Control Committee.                Store Your RVs  Arthur Romero, CSC Committee       The number one complaint, to our committee concerns RV's  & pop-up campers parked on Sandia Heights properties. If  you can sleep in it, it’s a recreational vehicle and storing it in  your driveway is a covenant violation. Please respect your  neighbors and store your RV in the garage or a storage facil- ity.    Complaint procedure guidelines     Complaints must be submitted using the form found on the  SHHA website or at the SHHA office. The online form is found  under “Quick links” at the bottom of the homepage.    Any SHHA member in good standing may file a covenant vio- lation complaint. If not a member, the complainant must join  the SHHA and agree to maintain membership for one year.  Tenants/renters cannot file a complaint.    The CSC guidelines help facilitate investigations into viola- tions alleged by a property owner who resides within the  same unit where the alleged violation exists, or within an ad- jacent unit, or in direct line of sight of the violation, as de- scribed in the Covenant Violation Form available online. If a  complaint is submitted by a member who resides in a loca- tion that is not consistent with these requirements, the CSC  reserves the right to act, or decline to act, upon the com- plaint depending on the nature, significance, and proximity  of the violation. The decision to act upon such a complaint  will be at the discretion of the CSC committee.    3   The GRIT – December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12    Drones  Robert Thomas    There’s lots of news these days about drones and their com- mercial and recreational uses. Commercially, this new tech- nology offers the potential for improvements in safety and  security for all of us as well as other applications including  agricultural production, wildlife management, and package  delivery to your doorstep. And it’s a great recreational tool  to get that aerial photo you only saw before in National Geo- graphic or Google Maps. But as with any new technology,  along with the beneficial uses, there are always those who  bend or break the rules for personal gain or for criminal ac- tivity.    It needs to be noted that there are no current Sandia Heights  covenants concerning the use of drones. What follows is  some information on practices and potential future actions  regarding the use of drones at the federal, state, and local  levels which can impact their usage use in Sandia Heights.    The FAA has set the federal rules for drones. The FAA clearly  distinguishes between drones for commercial purposes and  those for the hobbyist. Commercial drones must be regis- tered, an FAA Remote Pilot’s Certificate is required for the  drone operator, and if the drone will be flying in a controlled  airspace, prior approval from FAA’s air traffic control system  is required. Recreational drones are covered under the Small  UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) Rule, effective Aug 29,  2016, which places drones under the same rules and guide- lines as those for model aircraft. Specifically, operators must  (taken from the Special Rule for Model Aircraft, Public Law  112-95 Section 336):    a. Register the UAS with the FAA.  b. Fly for hobby or recreational purposes only.  c. Follow a community-based set of safety guidelines.  d. Fly the UAS within visual line-of-sight.  e. Give way to manned aircraft.  f. Provide prior notification to nearby airport and air traffic  control tower, if one is present, when flying within 5 miles of  an airport  g. Fly UAS that weigh no more than 55 lbs. unless certified by  a community-based organization    An aide to Lonnie Talbert, our District 4 County Commis- sioner, said that the County has plans to take up the issue of  drones sometime in the future.    There is a sign at the entrance to the Elena Gallegos Open  Space states that drones are not permitted in the area. Alt- hough the city has no ordinance restricting the use of drones  in public places, the rangers at Elena Gallegos cited proximity  to a National Wilderness Area. And public safety. Similar “No  Drones Allowed” signs stand at both the bottom and top of  the Sandia Peak Tram. The top is clearly encircled by the San- dia Mountain Wilderness Area. And at the bottom Tram ter- minal, although it is private property, the guards cite public  safety concerns and will/have kicked out violators. The High  Desert Community to our south has no rules or regulations  for drones. Rules and guidelines for outdoor hobbyists who  want to employ drones for that big photo shot can be found  at:   www.jmpeltier.com/2017/05/14/rules-flying-drone-backpack- ing-hiking/     That article specifies that drones are prohibited:  a. Within all national parks.  b. Within all federally-designated wilderness areas.  c. Can be, although are not generally, prohibited in state  parks. Rules vary from state to state and park to park, so look  for signs.  d. From flying within five miles of an airport, hospital or heli- port.  e. Within Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), such as over a  fire or a crime scene.  f. From operating less than 100 meters from wildlife.    Although there are no county or state laws concerning  drones currently on the books, the operation of a drone for  recreational purposes in a manner which constitutes an un- lawful action, a law already on the books, will elicit an of- ficer’s response and could result in criminal charges. For ex- ample, flying a drone in a manner to look over a neighbor’s  fence will be addressed under peeping-tom laws. Continual  photographing of children getting on/off a school bus or  walking down the street can be treated under child pornog- raphy laws.     There are assertions Some Bernalillo County officials assert  that Kirtland Air Force Base is looking into creating a drone- free corridor along the entire west side of the Sandia Moun- tains. Although the north-south runway at the Sunport has  been closed for some time now, the Air Force does regularly  fly helicopter missions in a north-south direction, seemingly  along Tramway Blvd.     In conclusion, it needs to be noted that there has not been  an avalanche of drone complaints to date. SHHA has received  two calls in the past year but, as noted above, the covenants  do not cover drones. Both an assistant to Lonnie Talbert and  a lieutenant at BCSO report that they have received just a few  calls in the last year. Sandia Heights Security reports four  drone complaints in the same period. Taking an optimistic  view, it appears so far that recreational drone pilots in our  community appear to be operating in a responsible manner  and we should feel good about that, at least for now.  4   The GRIT December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12  OCTOBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Judy Zabel has lived in Sandia  Heights for over 20 years, but she began her life in New  York. She obtained her law degree at Hofstra Univer- sity Law School and soon after she received an offer  she could not refuse to live in Albuquerque. This was  quite a change, but undaunted, she passed the New  Mexico Bar—one of the first one hundred women to  pass the New Mexico Bar since it was established in  1886. Judy became one of the first female Assistant  District Attorneys in the state. Being part of the D.A.’s  office, she was only doing criminal prosecution work.  “It was tough. There was only one other female in the  office and no female judges.” Judy stuck with it for a  couple of years but returned to New York University to  earn a Master of Laws in taxation. She came back to  Albuquerque and opened her own office. She joined a  firm for a few years but returned to private practice,  which she maintained for thirty-plus years until her re- tirement. Judy enjoyed her work primarily consisting of  estate planning. “I met with people and their families.  I had to listen carefully to help them determine the  best way to get what they wanted. I had to be atten- tive.” That attentiveness required visual observation of  the body language and emotions of her clients. This led  Judy to an interest in observing people and the world  around her through photography. Photography and  tax law required attention to detail.     This attention to the details of her surroundings be- came a keynote of Judy’s growing love affair with the  camera. The advent of digital photography spurred  Judy to join the Enchanted Lens Camera Club where  she received great support and opportunities to learn.  She had always liked taking pictures but now she was  learning to be a photographer. She began to study and  understand the principles and technique involved in  distinguishing a carefully thought-out composition  from a snapshot. She began to think like an artist.  There were monthly competitions in the Camera Club,  and she got up her courage to enter. To her surprise,  she received a top score. “Wow! Somebody liked it!”  she remembers thinking. She was on her way. Judy has  since won many awards within the Camera Club and at  the Annual New Mexico Photographic Art Show  (ANMPAS). This year She won a coveted Merit Award  at the ANMPAS with her photograph “Red Magic” (see  photo with this article).     Judy also loves to travel, having just returned from Bul- garia and Romania when I interviewed her. Her pho- tography and travel are synergistic, heightening her ex- periences around the world. She especially likes to  roam a bit off the beaten path and has been to Hun- gary, the Czech Republic, Namibia, Laos, Vietnam, and  Russia to name a few. Her main subjects are people and  animals. She favors black and white over color. “I like  to take photos of people unaware that I am photo- graphing them. I love their expressions and what they  are doing. My favorite photos are black and white  street scenes. I do color but in black and white, you can  really see the people, and not the pink T-shirt they are  wearing.”      Continued on page 11…  8   The GRIT –December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved -Projects activity since the last GRIT:    2898 Tramway Pl. – Fence pickets/Level brick path  711 - 25 Tramway Pl. -- Re-roof with Tan TPO  1726 Quail Run Ct. -- New AC units  365 Big Horn Ridge Dr. -- Re-roof with Tan TPO  619 Cedar Hill Rd -- Add storage shed  518 Black Bear Lp. – Kitchen re-model  511 Roadrunner Ln. -- Reinforce fence  1166 Laurel Lp. -- Xeriscape backyard & south side  527 Live Oak Pl. -- Re-stucco  793 - J Tramway Ln. -- Patch stucco  1470 Morning Glory Rd. – Re-roof with Tan TPO  8233 Raintree Dr. – Extend patio/shade/ stucco  2881 Tramway Pl. – Re-stucco  1553 Eagle Ridge Ln. – Re-landscape backyard  7716 Cedar Canyon Ct. – Install artificial turf in backyard  793 M Tramway Ln. – Re-roof w/Tan TPO/Repair ceiling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   9  The GRIT – December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12 10  The GRIT – December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12 11   The GRIT – December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12    …continued from page 7    One day about 5 years ago Judy saw the signs in the  neighborhood announcing the Sandia Heights Artists  Tour. She began exhibiting in the tour. She also began  exhibiting in some other local shows. Her work began  to “sell enough to support my work. But I really only do  it because I enjoy it.”    Judy also loves running marathons and has completed  a dozen. She still runs four to five miles several times a  week, taking in her surroundings with runs into the  Elena  Gallegos Open Space. Running, traveling, and captur- ing her experiences with photography all combine to  inform Judy’s life. When asked what inspires her about  her art, she thought a bit and replied, “It gives me a dif- ferent way of seeing things. I have a good time doing  it.”     Judy’s work can be viewed and purchased at the San- dia Heights Artist Tour, and online at   www.judyzabelphotos.com    Ron Lohrding        What does the International Space Station have in  common with Ron Lohrding’s Art? Read on to find out!     Ron’s roots go deep into Kansas soil. He was born  there and grew up on a cattle and wheat ranch 22 miles  from the nearest town. He learned his “3 R’s” in a  country school which for grades one through four was  one room. Ron stayed on the ranch through his high  school years. But, as Ron put it, “Driving tractor 10  hours a day in the July heat makes you want to do  things far away from the ranch.” He made that wish  come true, getting an athletic scholarship in football to  Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas. He was par- ticularly apt at the ‘rithmetic part of his early education  and majored in mathematics.    Ron met and married his wife, Jan, during his junior  year in college and one year later they relocated to  Puerto Rico to teach math. While in Puerto Rico, Ron  received a National Institute of Health fellowship to at- tend Kansas State in Manhattan, Kansas. There Ron  earned his Master’s, and PhD in mathematical statis- tics. He landed a job at Los Alamos National Laboratory  and began an interesting career that culminated in be- coming the assistant director for LANL’s industrial and  international programs.    Ron retired from LANL to start a second career running  a biotech company in Albuquerque. While looking for a  permanent home, they found Sandia Heights and loved  the space and the views. In 1991 Ron and Jan bought a  lot here, had their current home built and, in 1992,  moved in. Ron retired from the biotech company in  2002, but soon became involved helping to run an im- port business in Guatemala that focused on benefitting  the local population. As Ron puts it, “I failed at retire- ment three times!” Although he is still involved in aid- ing youth in Guatemala, he has finally slowed down  enough to do yard work.      12   The GRIT – December 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 12    Continued from page 11 …  But he still yearned to stretch his mind and work with his  hands in a creative way. Pottery came to mind, but he took  some classes from a fused glass artist in Rio Rancho and be- came intrigued. He bought a tiny (tiny as in “fits in a micro- wave) kiln, and began making jewelry pieces using dichroic  glass. Now this is where the space station part comes in.     Dichroic glass changes colors under different lighting condi- tions and viewing angles. The word dichroic comes from the  Greek: “di” meaning two and “chroma” meaning colors. Al- though fragments of glass with changeable colors have  been found dating back to the fourth century, modern di- chroic glass was developed by NASA. The technology in- volves depositing multiple ultra-thin films of transparent ox- ides of metals onto a glass surface. This specially coated  glass shields the instruments and humans in spacecraft like  the International Space Station from cosmic radiation and  the UV from unfiltered sunlight in space. When light hits the  dichroic layer, depending on the oxides used and the thick- ness of the layer, specific wavelengths pass through and  specific wavelengths are reflected resulting in a display of  different color groups that change with the angle and con- dition of the light. These colors are iridescent and jewel-like  in their brilliance.     Ron was fascinated by the science behind the material and  its inherent beauty. His math background became a source  of inspiration. He began utilizing the Fibonacci sequence  and the Golden Ratio in his designs. Ron turned out eye- catching pendants from his little microwave kiln. Jan was  wearing one when she and Ron were at Weem’s Art Gallery  in Albuquerque. The owner complimented Jan on it and  when Jan explained that her husband had made it, she  asked Ron to put some of his work in the gallery. Ron was  on his way. He bought a larger 17-inch kiln that could fire up  to 1400 F. He could express his love and knowledge of math  with carefully calculated creations that were larger and  more complex. Although based on science, the combina- tions of colors and their behavior in the firing were not al- ways predictable. Ron had to make subjective choices and  he found that he had evolved into an artist making unique  tabletop and wall art. He told me that “creative ideas come  to me when I am sitting at meetings, or in quiet time before  sleep or just waking up.”     He joined the Sandia Heights Artists after seeing signs about  the annual Studio Tour about seven years ago. Since then,  he has won a first-place ribbon at the New Mexico State Fair  and an Honorable Mention in a world-wide international  competition.     “I really enjoy when I take a piece out of the kiln and I see  the scientific effort in the materials and my design melded  into a piece that is inspiring for others to look at. I just hope  that my creation is something that they will enjoy.” Ron’s  work can be viewed and purchased at ScoJo’s Gifts in Albu- querque, and online at www.etsy.com/shop/Lohrding- GlassArt.    An Explanation of the SHHA Environment & Safety  Committee  Kathleen McCaughey, E&S Committee     We are looking for interested residents to join this commit- tee.   Our Purpose  The Environment & Safety Committee is charged with pro- tecting the wildlife and environment, and improving the  safety of our surroundings in the Sandia Heights neighbor- hood. We try to stay abreast of any potential changes or im- pacts. We also play a role in educating residents on relevant  topics. This committee, in association with Sandia Heights  Security, which provides security oversight for our resi- dents, works to make sure Sandia Heights is a safe and se- cure place to live.    Our Focus  Since Sandia Heights borders the national forest, we are in  a wildland-urban interface. Bordering on undeveloped  wildland vegetation affects us most importantly in two ar- eas: wildfires and wildlife. A major focus of this committee  is on wildfire readiness and preventing wildfires, through  Wildfire Workshops and GRIT articles. We have focused on  creating fire-resistant buffers to protect not only your  home, but your neighbors’, and on staying connected  through notification systems. It is also our responsibility in  Sandia Heights to coexist harmoniously with our wild neigh- bors and preserve their natural habitat.     Our roads are shared by pedestrians, bicyclists, automobiles  (and sometimes skateboarders). The streets are narrow and  curvy, and have speed limits that are lower than many resi- dents wish to drive. To help keep our residents and wildlife  safe, we continuously focus on speed limits, rules of the  road, and keeping road setbacks clear for visibility.

We solicited  your responses, penned a letter to the Mayor, and  communicated updates through the GRIT.      This past month we had our first Neighborhood After- noon Out encouraging neighborhood watches and fa- miliarizing residents with our safety and security part- nerships with the Fire Department, Sheriff, and Sandia  Heights Security.      We welcome you to join us. We meet once a month,  mostly through Zoom. Help us continue to keep Sandia  Heights a desirable and safe place to live. Call the office  for more information.
