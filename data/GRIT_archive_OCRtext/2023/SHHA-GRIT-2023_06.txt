Roger Hagengruber, SHHA President    The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association needs your help.  Across the country, non-profit community organizations face the same  problem: the emerging “death of volunteerism.” As interest and willing- ness to serve without compensation on the behalf of others dwindles,  boards, steering committees, and councils struggle to continue as going  concerns. The diminishing number of volunteers jeopardizes organiza- tions created to protect community values, ambience, and well-being.   SHHA has enough Board members to meet the required minimum of 11  (per the bylaws) to have SHHA continue as a viable entity. However, we  will have to amend the bylaws to reduce that required minimum from  eleven to a smaller number if the membership of the Board drops. We are  grateful to the new members who have stepped up to help us maintain an  adequate Board.  As noted in my two earlier messages in GRIT, we need Board and com- mittee members and also this year need a few chairpersons or officers.  The need for people to step forward is very high. Joining the Board and a  committee generally involves a commitment of less than 5 hours a month.  Meetings are in-person or via Zoom. Members serve three-year terms that  may be renewed once. (See Hugh Prather’s article in the May GRIT.)  SHHA has about 1850 members, of which around a hundred have  served on committees or the Board. Recognizing that some members are  not able to serve, there are still well over a thousand Sandia Heights resi- dents as a pool of volunteers. We need some of you to step up and spend  a few years helping SHHA maintain and preserve our wonderful neighbor- hood. Our high-desert environment needs our effort to protect it.  What’s involved? The Board meets once per month for about 2 hours.  Board members are required to serve on one of 7 committees, which meet  monthly. Currently, several committees need members. These commit- tees are central to protecting the covenants in Sandia Heights. The cove- nants assure our natural environment, ambience, and property values are  protected and maintained for all of us.  When Sandia Heights was created the founders created the covenant  approach for all units and established an Architectural Control Committee  (ACC) to make sure that colors, structures, uses, new construction, and  building modifications would be made in conformance with the covenants  for  each  unit.   Each  property  owner  agreed  to  respect  the  covenant   Continued on page 2…  …continued from page 1  2   The GRIT – June 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6    provisions and to get ACC approval before proceeding  with changes to existing property or new construction.  (Please see the May GRIT article by Richard Bracket).   The ACC and the Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  are keys to assuring that our unique environment and  property values are maintained for all of us that reside  in Sandia Heights. By the end of this year, we will lose  the chairs of these two critical committees. SHHA is call- ing upon all members for volunteers not only for the  Board but to chair and serve on these committees.  I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for all  of you who read the GRIT to consider joining the Board  and especially stepping up to chair a committee.   PLEASE, consider it.    Latest on Elena Gallegos Development  Cathleen McCaughey, Environment & Safety Chair    “Save the Elena Gallegos” (STEG) continues in their law- suit against the City of Albuquerque.  On April 26, the City of Albuquerque issued a press  release, announcing they will no longer pursue an Edu- cation Center in the Elena Gallegos. However, as ex- plained by STEG attorney Wade Jackson, “This an- nouncement, while welcome, is legally meaningless and  in no way binding. STEG will continue to seek a perma- nent injunction in order to preserve the Elena Gallegos  as open space for generations to come.”  On May 4, 2023, STEG had its first hearing in the 2nd  Judicial District Court of Bernalillo County. Judge Joshua  Allison evaluated the City’s motion for summary judg- ment that STEG’s eighteen citizen plaintiffs do not have  “standing” to enforce the deed to the Elena Gallegos.  During the hearing, CABQ attorney Laura Callanan made  repeated reference to the recent press release as  “proof” that there is no longer an actual controversy to  be decided. However, at one point, Judge Allison  bluntly asked Ms. Callanan if the City is entitled to  change its mind, to which she responded “yes.”   Judge Allison denied the City’s motion and found  that the Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient injuries to cre- ate an issue of fact for trial as to whether they have  standing. He also found that there were questions of  fact as to whether the City’s activities have already vio- lated the deed restriction.   On May 16, Judge Allison granted a summary judg- ment in favor of all eighteen citizen plaintiffs, i.e., that  they have standing to enforce the deed to the Elena  Gallegos Open Space. Next step for the plaintiffs is to  seek a permanent injunction against the proposed de- velopment.  STEG began a second round of fundraising on the Go- FundMe platform on May 15. Please consider a donation  that will support them in taking the case all the way to  trial. STEG is a 501(c)(3)—donations are tax-deductible.    3   The GRIT – June 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6  Weed and Fire Season is Here  Covenant Support Committee    Our nighttime temperatures have warmed, and with  the warm soils comes—weeds. And more weeds. And  the spring winds have spread seeds that create…yes,  you guessed it: even more and more weeds!  The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) receives  scores of complaints about landscaping and yard  maintenance, particularly in units comprised of patio  homes. If you own a property with zero lot lines, think  about the obvious importance of curb appeal and the  need for attractive frontage so close to the street and  so visible among clustered homes.  CSC members invest time and effort to investigate  every complaint about landscaping. But the very broad  language of the SHHA covenants—covering 38 units— in actuality means that the CSC cannot selectively inter- pret and impose landscape maintenance restrictions.  In other words, the general nature of the stipulations  in all of the units’ covenants does not empower the CSC  to impose higher standards than what was written. The  CSC, however, strongly encourages residents in the  zero-lot-line units to be mindful that the appearance of  their yards has a greater impact on the surrounding  neighbors than is the case with larger lots.  Please help your neighborhood, yourselves, and the  CSC by controlling your landscape and weeds through- out the growing season. Don’t wait until plants are un- wieldy, become woody, or constitute fire and/or safety  hazards. Just as we schedule haircuts every so often,  let’s keep our properties looking cared for and attrac- tive. In fact, while we’re at it, let’s remove our dead  vegetation too: this is one covenant that applies to all  property-owners. Good landscape maintenance will  help keep our home values strong, our streets safer  due to fire prevention and clear sightlines for vehicles,  bicycles, and pedestrians, and Sandia Heights as beau- tiful as it can be.  As a helpful guide for property owners, these photos  provide examples of dos and don’ts.  DO    Keep soil and gravel raked and inhospitable to weeds.    Prune trees, pull weeds, and trim hedges adjoining other lots.    Keep curbs tidy and corners cleared and visible.  DON’T    Don’t let weeds go to seed & dead plants convey neglect.    Don’t allow weeds to encroach on your neighbor’s property.    Don’t let weeds occupy driveway cracks, giving your home an  abandoned appearance and perhaps inviting suspicious activity.  4   The GRIT June 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6  APRIL CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

List    “Where are we going?” I asked our realtor after she  picked us up at Winrock Mall to show us a house she  thought we might like.  This was 1972, after my husband had completed  three years of military service at Tripler Army Hospital in  Honolulu, Hawaii. We had our two young boys in tow:  Dawson (age four) and David (age two). I was three  months pregnant with our third child, later named Ma- lia.  Our realtor Barbara responded, “It’s a new commu- nity at the base of the Sandia Tram in Bernalillo County,  just outside the city limits of Albuquerque. I think you’ll  like it.”  I wasn’t so sure, as Barbara’s van bumped along over  the Tramway Blvd dirt road from Montgomery Blvd NE  headed north. After all, I had just finished the first three  months of a pregnancy, and my stomach was still a bit  queasy.  But my husband and I were anxious to see a new  home that had just been framed. Barbara had told us  the architect who designed the house was Hildreth  Barker, generally known as ‘H’.  I was not one bit disappointed, as I loved the angles  of H’s design, quite different from the ordinary shapes  of most city houses and the lovely rounded parapets of  adobe homes all over New Mexico.  But what I especially liked was the fact that there  were no homes south nor west of the site. It felt like a  house with a huge wild grassy yard all around.  Since the front steps hadn’t yet been constructed,  Barbara led us around to the back door entering the  kitchen. She introduced us to the men laying flooring.  One stood up and nodded with a slight wink saying,  “Welcome, I’m sure you’ll like it here, but be careful. We  just killed a rattlesnake on the kitchen floor this morn- ing.”  “Argh,” I thought. Not my favorite reptile, having be- come cozy with very large geckos in our Kailua home in  Hawaii. Later, I tucked my boys in at the motel near Win- rock Mall thinking, “Yet another adventure ahead— bring it on!”    The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell    In 2004, Sandia Heights residents, Lynda Burch and a ce- ramics artist named Ralph Rudolph, found themselves  in the same artists’ cooperative gallery. Ralph had an  idea: what if we did an artists’ tour in Sandia Heights?  Ralph was on the SHHA board and got his idea ap- proved. They talked to five other artist friends, met at  their homes, and produced and distributed black-and- white, one-page fliers. They called the tour “Arts View  @ Sandia Heights”. On October 24, 2004, the first San- dia Heights artists’ tour was held with 7 members open- ing their studios to the public. The tour generated inter- est and recognition. It was decided to make it an annual  event. Over the years more artists joined and partici- pated. In 2010, the participating artists grew to 21 in 12  locations. In 2015, member Eric Guenette created the  distinctive watermelon pink logo for the Sandia Heights  Artists which is now an integral part of the Sandia  Heights Artists’ publications. Even the pandemic did not  extinguish the enthusiasm with many artists showing  virtually on the website and at three outdoor venues  hosted within health guidelines. This year, the Sandia  Heights Artists will hold their 20th tour with a multi-page  color guide, lots of publicity and signs, 15 stops and fifty  artists!  The Sandia Heights Artists Tour is a rich artistic tradi- tion that has grown in depth and quality. This article is  number one in a series spotlighting a few of the early  members of the Sandia Heights Artists who helped lay  the foundation for what the group has become. They  will all be participating in this year’s tour. I hope you en- joy learning about the artist that may live right next  door and mark your calendars for September 9–10.  Marta Burckley  What to do with gourds besides piling them in a bowl  for Thanksgiving table décor? Just ask Marta Burckley,  who turns them into one-of-a-kind pieces of art.  Originally from Buffalo, New York, Marta and her hus- band, Ron, drove their new 1966 Volkswagen bus to Al- buquerque. They settled near the UNM Medical Center.   Although she has no formal art training, Marta comes  from a creative family. As a 3rd-grade teacher for 25  years, she used her love of art in the classroom at every  opportunity. Marta found her personal artistic outlet af- ter taking a ceramics class. She even had a big kiln put  in her backyard. In 1999, they wanted to get out of the  city and found their current home here in Sandia  Heights. She could not duplicate her big kiln in their new  home, but Marta’s creative urge could not be con- tained. She discovered the New Mexico Gourd Society  in Albuquerque, was intrigued, and fell in love. Marta ex- plained that making artistic pieces from gourds uses  many of the same properties she enjoyed working with   8   The GRIT – June 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved -Projects activity since the last GRIT:  10 Juniper Hill Rd – Relocate Mailbox  24 Sandia Heights Drive – PV Panel Installation  50 Rock Ridge Drive – Paint Trim  97 Juniper Hill Rd – Re-roof w/TPO  401 Live Oak Loop – Repair Stucco, Paint Garage  538 Black Bear Road – Replace Windows  602 Cedar Hill Rd – Replace Windows  623 Cedar Hill Rd – Re-roof w/TPO  760-3 Tramway Lane – Re-stucco/Re-finish  793-C Tramway Lane – Plexiglass Install on Patio  795-K Tramway Lane – Stucco Repairs  801 Tramway Lane – Mailbox Installation  810 Live Oak – Re-roof w/TPO  919 Tramway Lane – Re-roof w/TPO  919 Tramway Lane – Repair/Re-roof Patio  1015 Tramway Lane – Repair/Replace Roof Shingles  1060 Red Oaks Loop – Replace/Paint Front Door  1433 Honeysuckle Dr – Reroof w/silicone  1553 Eagle Ridge Lane – Re-roof w/TPO  1701 Quail Run Ct - Landscaping  1723 Quail Run Ct – Install Solar Array  1858 Tramway Terrace Loop – Minor Roof Repair  1903 Quail Run Rd. – Replace Swamp Cooler  1933 Quail Run Loop – Repaint Roof TPO  2034 Quail Run Drive – Re-Stucco/Paint Front Wall  2703 Tramway Circle – PV Panel Installation  2724 Tramway Circle –Fence Installation  2751 Cliffrose Dr. – Paint Trim  2758 Cliffrose Dr. – Replace Windows  2898 Tramway Pl – Mailbox Installation  7715 Cedar Canyon Ct – Safety Railing Installation  9502 Sandia Vista Dr. – Accessory Structure/Gate               Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

They speak to me. There is so  much I can do with them!” Marta has been turning  gourds into art for 15 years and is inspired by their or- ganic qualities and innate beauty. “I look at each indi- vidual gourd and I think about how I can work with its  unique properties.” Even though she transforms them  into objets d’art, she explains that she “always wants  the viewer to recognize it as a gourd.”  Marta saw an article in the GRIT 15 years ago inviting  interested artists to come to a meeting of the Sandia  Heights Artists.  So, she did! “My thought was that it  would be a lot of fun!” And it has been.  You can view and purchase Marta’s work at the  Yucca Art Gallery in Old Town Albuquerque and at the  Sandia Heights Artists’ Tour September 9–10.          Lynda Burch  Most people use stamps on envelopes. Some collect  them. But Lynda Burch upcycles old stamps—can- celled and uncancelled—into unique works of art.  In the 70s and 80s, Lynda was a representative for a  home furnishings company. She specialized in interior  design pieces including art. “Working around all that  art, I decided I really wanted to paint!” Moving to Albu- querque in 1981, she finally found time to start classes  in watercolor. But that medium could not contain her  innovative creativity and she soon began working with  collage and then acrylic paints. Her work was abstract,  textural, and colorful. Being in Sandia Heights, she be- came a founding member of the budding artists’ group  and participated in the first tour.   The use of stamps all started when her husband  gave her his childhood stamp collection and she took it  to a philatelist to see if it was worth anything. It wasn’t,  but she became intrigued with stamps. She started  buying old uncancelled stamps and friends started giv- ing her stamps. Very quickly she had lots of stamps and  she experimented with incorporating them into her  art. Soon old maps joined the collages in her work,  adding an intriguing dimension to her artistic expres- sion. Around 2007 Lynda showed a prototype of her  stamp and map collage work to the buyer for the Pal- ace of the Governors Museum Gift Shop in Santa Fe. He  said he would purchase prints of her work if she could  do a series. She did and he handled her work for a cou- ple of years. Since then, she has done over 100 original  works.  Her pieces range from abstract to whimsical. She  finds inspiration from many sources, but she is espe- cially inspired by the pictures on the stamps. “I like to  send a message to the viewer. I want to tell a story with  my art. I pay attention to the images and colors on the  stamps and utilize ones that support the theme of my  painting as much as possible.” Surrounded by boxes of  thousands of stamps in her studio, Lynda’s eyes spar- kle as she shows me the small details in the stamps in- corporated into the paintings. It is painstaking and te- dious work. Her largest work, which recently found a  buyer, included over 700 stamps!   Lynda’s imagination has expanded beyond stamps  and maps. She had an extensive collection of wine la- bels from her travels with her husband and she began  incorporating the labels into her collages. What will be  next?  Lynda’s work can be viewed and purchased at  Amapola Gallery in Old Town Albuquerque and at the  Sandia Heights Artists Tour September 9-10.        12   The GRIT – May 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6    Whiteout!  Stan Davis    If you’ve walked on any trails in the Sandias, even  within the Open Spaces, you have probably noticed the  ubiquitous “white,” or light-colored, geologic dikes  cutting through the Sandia Granite. These types of  dikes are magmatic—having formed when liquid mag- mas flowed into preexisting vertical (or somewhat ver- tical) cracks in the granite and then cooled and crystal- lized into slab-shaped intrusions of solid rock. There  are thousands of these dikes in the Sandia Granite, and  also in the metamorphic rocks of the Rincon Hills and  Rincon Ridge just north of Sandia Heights. You could  call these dikes “white” dikes for simplicity, because  they tend to be white, or off-white, or at least colors  that are somewhat lighter than the host rocks. Miner- alogically speaking, these dikes are felsic—relatively  rich in quartz and light-colored feldspars—much like  the Sandia Granite itself.   There are three main types of “white” dikes recog- nized here:   (1) pegmatite dikes, which contain relatively large  crystals;   (2) aplite dikes, which contain uniformly small-to- medium-sized crystals and appear “sugary” in  texture; and   (3)  less-common, predominantly quartz dikes.   The “white” dikes have been reported to be up to  about 30-feet wide and can be thousands of feet long.  They are only slightly younger than the Sandia Granite  (Meso-Proterozoic, or “PreCambrian” in age)—hence  very old, and represent the latest stages of magma in- jection at the time. The cracks into which the dikes in- truded had to have formed in solid, brittle rock,  whether Sandia Granite or Rincon metamorphic rocks.   The dikes have a wide range of orientations, and  sometimes occur in swarms. Usually the “white” dikes  are more resistive to erosion than the surrounding  rocks, so that they often stick up above the ground  around them or out of cliff faces, forming walls, ledges  and protrusions.      The metamorphic rocks at the top of Juan Tabo Peak are intruded  by a “swarm” of stunning pegmatite dikes (The Jemez is in the  background). Some of these “white” dikes can be seen from San- dia Heights. The inset shows a close-up of the coarse-grained fabric  of these types of dikes, as well as a contact between the “white”  dike and darker metamorphic rocks.      Here a trail in the Sandias goes up and over a large (and long) aplite  dike “wall.” The inset shows a close-up of the characteristic uniformly  fine-grained “sugary” texture of these types of dikes.      This picture shows an impressive chunk of a quartz dike sticking up  out of the ground in the Rincon Hills, north of Sandia Heights, west  of Forest Road 333.  13 The GRIT – June 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6 14   The GRIT – June 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 6  Wildflowers  Photos by Claudia Mitchel    With the late-winter snow and rains, this has been a  particularly good spring for wildflowers.
