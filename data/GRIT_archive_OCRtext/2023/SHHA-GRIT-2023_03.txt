Welcome to SHHA, Angela!      2   The GRIT – March 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 3  Continued on page 3…  2023 Annual Meeting Reports of Officers    President: Roger Hagengruber  I was elected president of the Sandia Heights Homeown- ers Association at the December 9, 2020, Board meeting and  took office after the 2021 Annual Meeting. It has been an  honor to serve for the past two years. The Board has asked  me to continue to serve as President for an additional year  and I agreed, so it will be my honor to serve you for another  and final year.   SHHA has some 1800 members and comprises over 2400  properties. There are 39 units in Sandia Heights, each with  separate covenants, and that number will change from time  to time as new developments seek to join SHHA as a unit. We  have two full-time employees that staff our offices at San Ra- fael and Tramway.  Our Board of Directors meets monthly, and the various  committees meet separately approximately monthly as well.  Two of our committees—Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) and the Architectural Control Committee (ACC)—are  especially busy approving plans submitted by owners (ACC)  and enforcing the covenants (CSC). It is difficult to give  proper appreciation to the chairs and members of all our  committees. This is especially true for the ACC and CSC,  where so many volunteers give so much of their time. We all  owe them our gratitude.   The SHHA Board is anxious to add new members, so if you  have an interest in joining the Board, please let a member or  the office know. We will be asking the membership of SHHA  to approve two new members at this 2023 Annual Meeting.  Yearly notes:  • We are in good shape financially with all bills paid on  time, adequate insurance, and banking arrangements. Unfor- tunately, our costs have continued to rise to the point where  we could not continue with our current dues without running  a significant deficit, which is not allowed. So, this January we  increased our dues to $15.00 monthly with the expectation  that this increase will see us through the next several years.  Our Tram tickets also increased to $10.00, which remains a  bargain compared to prices at the Tram.  • In the past year, we lost two employees to personal ill- ness. We were fortunate to hire a new administrator, Angela  Moreno, who lives in our area and comes to us with consid- erable administrative experience. She joined Betsy Rodri- guez in our office. For Betsy and me, the past two years of  turnover and turmoil has been a challenge and a difficult  workload for Betsy. We are all grateful to Betsy for seeing  our office through these difficult transitions.  • Our committees handled hundreds of approvals for  property modifications and many covenant issues, some in- volving our SHHA attorney. This represents a large workload  and is a notable accomplishment.  • Our attorney retired from practice at the end of last  year, so we engaged the services of Scott Turner who has  very extensive experience with homeowners’ associations.  We have begun another review of our bylaws at the sug- gestion of several Board and SHHA members. When this re- view is completed and approved by the Executive Committee  and the Board, we plan to hold a special meeting of the SHHA  membership to seek approval.  At this meeting, we are pleased to welcome John Chavez  from Sandia Heights Services and Bernalillo Commissioner  Walt Benson to present upcoming changes in the Sandia  Heights water system. Your Board members attended a  meeting to hear about these changes and asked for this  presentation at our annual meeting since we were sure that  everyone would have an interest.    Vice President: Dale Arendt (thru November 2022), Hugh  Prather (after November)  The Vice President’s role is primarily a supporting role for  the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. The VP  oversees coordination of the monthly Executive Committee  meeting and leads monthly meetings when the President is  not available.  The Vice President also chairs the Nominating Committee.  This past year we initiated the concept of having Board and  Committee recruitment as a year-long initiative and not just  a year-end strategy. We continue to recruit excellent people  to serve on our committees and Board. But we have many  competitors for these excellent volunteers and our pool of  available personnel is sometimes thin.  In 2023, we will continue to explore new ways to keep re- cruiting quality volunteers. Our desire is to have more wait- ing in the wings to serve on our Board while having our com- mittees adequately staffed with exemplary volunteers.  The other major initiative we introduced this year was a  Consent Agenda in an attempt to streamline our Board meet- ings and provide optimal time to focus on our most urgent  and upcoming initiatives. In essence, a Consent Agenda is  one motion that approves all electronic meeting reports that  the Board has received and reviewed since the last board  meeting. This Consent Agenda eliminates the need to have  numerous time-depleting oral reports that are looking back- wards on activities over the past month and allows the Board  to have more time for conversations pertaining to futuristic  priorities.    Secretary: Martin Kirk  I was elected Secretary of the Sandia Heights Homeown- ers Association at the December 9, 2020, Board meeting and  took office after the 2021 Annual Meeting. It has been an  honor to serve this past year and to be voted by the SHHA  Board to serve one additional year.   • As Secretary, I serve on the Executive Committee, which  meets on the 1st Wednesday of every month.   • As Secretary, I work with the Communications (Grit)  Committee to approve Grit content.   • I performed the following functions in accordance with  the By-Laws.  …continued from page 2  3   The GRIT – March 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 3  Continued on page 7…  o Oversaw the preparation and approval of the Board  meeting minutes.  o Certified the presence of a quorum necessary for the  proper conduct of business at each Board meeting.  o Ensured the preparation and publication of the notifica- tion for the Annual Meeting.  o Ensured that SHHA’s Official Records Book is properly  maintained and is on file at the SHHA office.  o Reviewed and approved the format and printing of the  monthly GRIT.  o Performed additional duties as needed by the Executive  Committee and the Board in general.  o Researched and presented as a member of the E&S  committee on Zoom my findings about safety, crime,  and ingress/egress traffic issues in Sandia Heights  Treasurer: Randy Tripp  Finance Committee   Members:  Randy Tripp, Chair  Fenton McCarthy  Carnie Abajian  Tracey Goodrich  Diane Barney  Jim Stewart  2022 Budget Results.

Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  Members:        Bob Thomas, Chair  Stan Davis    Jim Stewart, ACC liaison  Joyce Harkwell    Stephen Baca  Vicki Meredith    Judy Chreist  Kathleen McCaughey    Randy Tripp, Past ACC liaison through November  Functions:  Sandia Heights has Use Restrictions that are stated in the  Covenants and posted on the SHHA website. There are 38  sets of covenants, each applying to a designated unit within  the community. The covenants are filed with the Bernalillo  County Clerk and are legally binding documents. The CSC cur- rently has eight members who work with property owners to  enforce these Use Restrictions. The CSC provides covenant  enforcement through a formalized process.  Formal complaints are submitted to the SHHA office on a  Covenant Complaint Form found on the SHHA website. The  identities of the complainant, alleged violator, address, and  nature of the complaint are considered confidential and  available only to CSC members.    Many of the covenants were written in the 1960–1970  timeframe and do not specifically address some of the key  issues we face today. For some complaints, the unit cove- nants do not cover or address the alleged violation and there  is little the CSC can do to help. We are bound by what your  covenants permit. The covenants can be changed but are  owned by the homeowners, and only the homeowners in a  specific unit can change their covenants. The CSC cannot  change the covenants. The SHHA webpage offers guidance  on how to change your unit covenants.    In some situations, the Bernalillo County Zoning Codes  and Ordinances are more restrictive than the SHHA cove- nants, such as for outdoor lighting, barking dogs, and yard  trash. In these instances, we encourage the homeowner to  file a complaint with the County. The SHHA office staff can  help with contacting the County.  The CSC meets on the first Tuesday of every month at 6:00  PM in the SHHA conference room. In the later part of 2022,  we moved past COVID-19 restrictions with Zoom meetings  and held in-person meetings in the conference room. If you  plan to attend a meeting, we request that you notify the  SHHA office 24 hours ahead of time and provide the subject  matter. Homeowners with questions or a statement to make  to the Committee are allotted five minutes at the beginning  of each meeting.  Then the meeting goes into Executive Ses- sion to maintain the confidentiality of CSC business. The CSC  Agenda and Minutes are for internal distribution only.  8   The GRIT – March 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 3    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  30 Cedar Hill Place – Reroof w/TPO Membrane  99 Juniper Hill Road – Replace Exterior Beams and  Shade Structure Installation   112 White Oaks Drive – Additional Roof Mounted Photo- voltaic Panels Installation   155 Juniper Hill Road – Plant Two Pinon Trees  374 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof with Shingles  560 Black Bear Place -- Landscaping  720-24 Tramway Lane – Reroof and Install Trex Decking   1019 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   1134 Marigold Drive – Reroof   1203 Marigold Drive – Reroof   2529 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Wooden Fencing  with Block Walls.  2711 Tramway Circle – Replace Windows and Re-stucco   9104 Lynx Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels In- stallation   9502 Sandia Vista Dr. – Accessory Storage  9505 Sandia Vista Dr. – Installation of Pool and Pergola   12626 Colony Place – Sunroom Addition and Patio Con- struction                                              Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

This compares  to fifty-two complaints over the previous year. All were in- vestigated by CSC members, and recommendations were  made as to the validity of the complaints and actions to  take for resolution, if necessary. Of these, 38 were closed  in 2022.   Several complaints in 2022 required legal actions by the  SHHA attorney.       2022 Successes and Challenges  The CSC authored many articles in The GRIT in 2022.   These ranged from reminders about trash bins and out- door lighting to how-to details regarding Airbnb-like rent- als, septic systems, and radon testing. A list of our 2022 ar- ticles was published in the February GRIT.    Complaints dealing with trash bins and outdoor lighting  continue to be a large part of the CSC workload. Signifi- cantly, in 2022 the CSC confronted several covenant viola- tions dealing with parked RVs, Airbnb-like rentals, and inva- sive elm trees. Many RV violations were successfully re- solved and the RVs removed, although with some difficulty  in a few cases, and several are on-going.  Unfortunately,  one Airbnb-like violation could not be successfully resolved  by the CSC and is now with the SHHA attorney for filing le- gal action in District Court.    It appears that Airbnb-like and similar short-term rentals  will be a growing problem in Sandia Heights. All covenants  prohibit the renting of part of a house, such as a room, but  do not prohibit the renting of the entire house. It is worth- while noting that two units in Sandia Heights have recently  amended their covenants to prohibit short-term rentals of  any kind, one for a minimum of 30 days and another for a  minimum of six months.    Invasive elm trees are an increasing threat to the com- munity. These trees have matured to heights that diminish  homeowner views which, of course, impacts property val- ues. Additionally, these trees produce saplings at an alarm- ing rate.  The CSC has limited authority to enforce removal  of these invasive trees, and so it is asking for homeowner  cooperation to remove the trees. For instances where cov- enant violations have been filed, the CSC has sent “Good  Neighbor” letters asking for neighbors to work together to  remove both the offending trees and saplings.    The CSC will aggressively enforce covenant violations of  RV parking and Airbnb-like rentals, and asks for home- owner help to combat invasive elm trees. It is important  and necessary for both the SHHA committees and the  homeowners, together, to endorse the SHHA dual Mission  Statements—preservation of property values, and mainte- nance of the environment and unique quality of living in the  Sandia Heights community. The CSC fully supports these  Mission Statements.

We always welcome Letters to the Editor and your response to articles in The GRIT. Email us at thegritshha@gmail.com.                —Wildfire Risk Reduction Workshop on March 25    On March 25, from 10:00–11:30 AM, at the Church of the Good Shepard (7834 Tennyson St. NE), SHHA will hold a  workshop providing important, actionable information about specific steps you can take to greatly reduce the like- lihood that YOUR home will be damaged or destroyed by wildfire. Because Sandia Heights is in the “wildland-urban  interface” (WUI), our homes and community are at greater risk from fires started by lightning, careless cigarette  tossing, etc. The good news is that we can effectively “harden” our homes and reduce surrounding fuel for fires,  essentially creating a self-defense system against a fast-moving wildfire. At the workshop, experts will discuss the  elements of both the structure and surrounding environment that should be addressed to protect against wildfire.  Organizations represented through presentations and/or information tables will include Bernalillo County Fire De- partment (Javier Torres, Wildland Coordinator), Ciudad Soil & Water Conservation District (Ricky Reedy, Forest  Health Coordinator), and the Bernalillo County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Services. Also, the For- est Service has been invited.          Community Events Bulletin Board      This group is not sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
