Rick Thomson, Community Service & Membership    In my service on the Community Service and Member- ship Committee, I hear the question, “What do my  membership fees support?” In light of the dues in- crease this month, you may be asking this, too.  First, a little personal background. We moved to  Sandia Heights one year ago from a very urban setting  in another state, literally surrounded by millions of peo- ple. As we searched for a home in Albuquerque, we fell  in love with this area. We have been thrilled with the  parade of wildlife routinely passing through our yard.  We love how the homes blend into their natural set- ting. Visitors from elsewhere are astounded with the  natural beauty in Sandia Heights. Serving on the Board  and this Committee has given me an appreciation of  what our very reasonable membership fees support.  It is easy to see what HOA fees support if you have  security gates, golf courses, tennis courts, swimming  pools, manicured paths, and such. In their own way,  these neighborhoods are beautiful, too.  But to understand what our HOA fees support, you  need to view through a different lens. Much of what  we pay goes to support things that we do not see,  which provides for that which we do see. SHHA com- mittees work to maintain our environment and natural  beauty. There are administrative and legal fees associ- ated with the work of these committees. So, when you  see the deer, bobcats, coyotes, roadrunners, quail,  bears, and such routinely exploring your yard and the  neighborhood, please understand that is part of what  your membership fees support. When you see the lim- ited walls and fences, that is what your fees support.  When you see homes of subdued colors blending into  the foothills, that is what your fees support. When you  see minimal additional structures not blocking your or  others’ views, that is what your fees support. So, much  of what you do not see costs money. Bottom line: your  HOA works to protect your property values!  In addition, there are discounted tram tickets, ad- ministrative services in the SHHA office, this monthly  newsletter, and many other seemingly minor, out- wardly visible benefits you may not even be taking ad- vantage of. Yet still you benefit from them all.  If you look around and see the natural beauty and  wildlife, if you see the lack of obtrusive structures, then  please understand that is where your fees are going.  And please join a committee to help contribute and be  a part of all that is so great here!  2023 SHHA Annual Meeting   Procedures of Conduct    • Please silence all cell phones during meeting.  • Questions of the Officers or Committee Chairs will  be written, handed in to the Secretary, and each ad- dressed according to the agenda.  • Before speaking, a member must be recognized by  the Presiding Officer, please present yourself at a  microphone to be recognized and state your name.  • Speakers will be limited to three minutes.    No Airbnb!  Covenant Support Committee    Big house, feeling lonely, want to meet new folks?  There are many ways to satisfy this need, but doing an  Airbnb-type room rental is not one of them. It is very  tempting to rent out that unused bedroom in order to  make extra money; however, your covenants do not  permit this.  There are also concerns about maintaining security  in your neighborhood as a short-term landlord. You are  inviting transient renters into the area, which may pose  a threat to your neighbors. The Sandia Heights Security  Patrol, available by subscription, does a great job of pa- trolling and looking for unfamiliar cars in your area. But  by doing short-term rentals, you make their job much  more difficult.  If you have your home listed as a daily room rental,  please immediately remove your listing. If your neigh- bor is involved in room rental, please file a covenant  complaint so that we may investigate—your name will  be kept confidential.          3   The GRIT – January 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 1    What’s the Attraction?  Stan Davis, Covenant Support Committee member    Something geologically interesting happens at the  western foot of the Sandia Mountains and if you hike or  walk there, you have probably seen this phenomenon,  though you may not have paid much attention to it. In  fact, you have probably walked all over it. Have you ever  noticed accumulations of sparkling, tiny black “silt”  grains along the various trails and arroyos along the  western side of the Sandias? If you “dab” the surface of  the trail or arroyo with a magnet—any refrigerator mag- net will do—the magnet will pick up and hold onto thou- sands of these grains. They are magnetite.  The origin of the magnetite is the Sandia Granite  which has magnetite present in minute amounts. Mag- netite is a type of iron oxide (Fe3O4) and is a common  magnetic, iron-ore mineral in the Earth’s crust. Erosion  in the mountains causes pebble, sand, silt and smaller- sized grains to be washed downstream when it rains.  High-energy streams weaken drastically beyond the  mountain front as they enter the alluvial aprons and  gentler arroyos. As streams weaken, heavier grains fall  out first and lighter grains last. Magnetite grains are  very fine and light; they often form noticeable ribbon- like accumulations along and on the surface of gentle  portions of arroyos and even on hiking trails. This pro- cess is called “winnowing.” Much of the magnetite was  deposited within the thick accumulation of alluvial sedi- ments throughout the past millions of years. Heavy  rains that result in small, short-lived streams help sift  magnetite grains to the surface through winnowing.   Magnetite “ribbons”  can be found all over  the western side of the  Sandias, such as along  arroyos and trails in  Elena Gallegos Open  Space in our own back  yard. If you are paying  attention, you will find  magnetite  “ribbons”  along many other trails,  including Piedra Lisa,  Pino, Embudito, Em- budo, and others. But  you won’t find magnet- ite on the trails on the Madera limestone on the eastern  side of the Sandias, for example, because magnetite is  not present in the limestone.   Local Sparrows  Mary Schmauss, Wild Birds Unlimited    Sparrow species are found throughout North America;  New Mexico is fortunate to be home to a variety of  them. Many people think of sparrows as drab birds; in- deed sparrows are often called LBJs— little brown jobs.  However, many have beautiful plumage. Take a mo- ment and see what LBJs might be in your own backyard.  Here are a few that you can see right now in NM:  The Dark-eyed Junco is not often thought of as a  sparrow, but it is in fact a member of the sparrow fam- ily. One of the most common birds in North America, it  spends winter months in New Mexico and sports the  nickname “snow bird.” Juncos are fairly easy to identify.  This attractive sparrow is 6.25" long with a distinctive  dark hood, a brownish back, white under-belly and a  pale-pinkish short beak. Two sub-species of the Dark- eyed Junco that also winter in New Mexico include the  Oregon and Pink-sided Junco. Each have a grayer hood  with rusty or pink  flanks. Usually seen  in flocks, Juncos  prefer to forage for  seeds  on  the  ground.  Juncos  commonly visit bird  feeders in winter.  Juncos are early  birds. I often see  them scooting on the ground below my bird feeder just  before daybreak.    The White-crowned Sparrow is aptly named. It is per- haps the easiest sparrow to identify. This rather large  sparrow is 7" long with a striking black and white striped  head. It has a light brown back, gray breast and yellow- orange bill. Like many sparrows, it prefers to forage for  seeds on the ground and will visit bird feeders searching  for its favorite: black-oil sunflower seeds. The less-com- mon White-throated Sparrow has similar markings. The  notable distinction is its white throat and yellow lores  (tiny feathers between eye and bill).    Widespread in New Mexico is the Song Sparrow. A  6.25" rusty-gray bird with bold breast streaks that con- verge to a central breast spot. Its fairly long tail is  rounded and most noticeable when in flight. This spar- row is found in a variety of habitats. I usually see this  sparrow in the Bosque along the Rio Grande. The Song  Sparrow mainly forages for seeds on the ground. They  form loose flocks in winter. Not a common visitor to  backyard bird feeders, but will use bird baths.

The deed that was put in  place is enforceable and “runs with the land.” There  were clear and concise Land Use Restrictions written  into the deed. Regardless of the restrictive cove- nants that prohibit it, City of Albuquerque began plan- ning this expansion project in early 2021. Minutes from  the initial “Citizen Advisory Committee” meetings are  available at https://foothillseducationcenter.com/meet- ings/. Sandia Heights was not represented, nor in- formed, during the planning stages of this project. In  fact, the committee was made up of CABQ employees,  Parks & Recreation (P&R) staff, a handful of P&R- aligned volunteers, and several representatives from  Dekker/Perich/Sabitini, the firm that was hired to do the  “Feasibility Study.”  Intent of the Deed by the Original Signatories. To  better understand the intent of the Deed at the time, an  ad hoc member of the Environment & Safety Commit- tee, Viki Teahan, recently spoke on the phone with the  former Albuquerque Academy Board of Trustees Presi- dent, Richard G. Elkins. Mr. Elkins presently resides in  Florida. His signature, along with former ABQ Mayor  Harry Kinney, are on the Land Deed signed in 1982. Both  parties agreed to the terms of the deed and Elena  Gallegos was purchased by the City of Albuquerque af- ter taxpayers voted to raise taxes in order to buy the  land! When speaking to Mr. Elkins about the city’s cur- rent plan to ignore the Land Use Restrictions, he stated  that “building in the Elena Gallegos Open Space would  be against the spirit of the original transaction, which  was to keep Elena Gallegos from being developed.”  Viki was grateful for the opportunity to clarify that orig- inal intent of the deed.   Unfortunately, there is presently less support of that  original “spirit” of the deed by the City of Albuquerque,  Parks & Recreation, and Open Space Division.  Get Involved. There is a group of concerned residents  that have formed a nonprofit under the name Save  Elena Gallegos. Information on the project is available  on their web site www.saveelenagallegos.org. They are  also gathering signatures on an online petition which  can be found through their site. Everyone is urged to re- view the facts and history surrounding this situation  while there is still time to be heard!    SH Tips and Hacks    Here are some things to check on monthly for both win- ter and (it’ll be here sooner than you think) spring.  Monthly winter checks:  • Check for drafts. Cold air slipping in around doors and  windows can cause higher heating bills. Use this sim- ple trick: light a stick of incense and slowly move it  around the seams of doors and windows. When the  smoke blows around instead of rising in a straight  line, you've got a draft. Many gaps can be eliminated  by applying a little caulk.   • Cover outdoor air conditioning and evaporative cool- ing units. Snow and ice can damage outdoor units if  they aren't protected. Covers are available at most  home improvement stores, but even a secured can- vas tarp will do.   Monthly spring checks:  • HVAC checkup. It’s a good idea to have your system  tuned up before the heat arrives, but use a trained  professional for this. Many companies offer dis- counts to those who sign maintenance agreements  for spring and fall tune-ups.   • Roof inspection. Winter snow and ice can damage  shingles and flat roofs which could lead to leaks. You  can inspect your pitched roof with binoculars, but  don’t go up there. According to the Consumer Prod- uct Safety Commission, about 500,000 people are in- jured in ladder-related accidents each year. Roof re- pairs are best left to a qualified contractor.   • Check gutters. Ice buildup during the winter months  can cause gutters to loosen and sag. Gutters that  don’t drain properly may create drainage issues—left  for a season or two, an unstable gutter can spill  enough water to damage the foundation.   • Inspect walkways and driveways. Cracks and buckles  caused by freezing temperatures should be repaired  before they become a major issue.   • Check seals around doors and windows. Check for  drafts again. Cracked caulking should be touched up  to prevent the loss of cooled air all summer.    Next month we’ll cover some monthly checks that  are not seasonal.    8   The GRIT – January 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 1    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  21 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof   54 Rock Ridge Court – Construct Stuccoed Mailbox   65 Pinon Hill Place – Paint Front Doors   67 Juniper Hill Loop – Entry Gate Structure and Deck Ex- tension   305 Big Horn Ridge Place – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation  318 Big Horn Ridge Road – Reroof   340 Live Oak Road – Garage Addition   340 Live Oak Road – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation   451 Live Oak Lane – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation   560 Black Bear Place – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  646 Cougar Loop – Replace Front Gates  1101 San Rafael Avenue – Reroof   1148 Marigold Drive – Portable Basketball Goal  1166 Laurel Loop – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation   1845 Tramway Terrace Loop – Install Wooden Fence and  Gate  2527 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Wooden Fencing   2866 Tramway Circle – Re-stucco House and Walls   2899 Tramway Place – Exterior Repairs and Mainte- nance  7717 Cedar Canyon Court – Stucco Repairs and Color  Coat       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

With the annual visitation at the  park exceeding 150,000 people, the Open Space Divi- sion is trying to keep up with the demands placed upon  the area’s natural resources. Several trail projects are  underway or being contemplated including the Simms  Park Road Trail, a new nature trail and other renova- tions throughout the Sandia Foothills.  The Simms Park Road Trail  The park commonly referred to as Elena Gallegos is  officially known as Albert G. Simms Park, named after  rancher, banker and politician who purchased much of  the Elena Gallegos Land Grant in the 1930s for $1.00 an  acre. Upon Simms death in 1964 the land was left to the  Albuquerque Academy and a portion of this land was  purchased by the City of Albuquerque in the 1980s.  The Simms Park Road Trail starts at the Tramway  Trail and parallels Simms Park Road to the entry booth  at the park. There is also a horse spur which starts to  the north of Simms Park Road where Tramway Boule- vard crossed the Pino Arroyo. The horse trail follows  the arroyo before crossing Simms and joining the main  trail up to the park entrance. Work on this trail was  completed the end of last year [i.e., 1995].  The New Nature Trail  The Open Space Operations Section is currently con- structing a new wheelchair accessible Nature Trail. This  trail will start at a new parking lot area and restroom  facility located to the north of Kiwanis Picnic Area. The  trail will be paved with earth-toned concrete, have  three wooden bridges over arroyos and will be approx- imately one third of a mile in length. There will be inter- pretive signs and rest areas along the way. This trail will  hook up with the existing nature trail at the wildlife  blind overlooking the pond. Construction began in July  with volunteers from the Kiwanis Club roughing out  the trail and preparing the area for the Open Space Op- eration crew. Completion is expected sometime this  year, weather permitting.  Youth Conservation Corps  This summer the City of ABQ Open Space Division  and the Sandia District of the US Forest Service formed  a partnership to administer a state grant for a Youth  Conservation Corp (YCC) program, providing young  people between 16 and 25 with outdoor conservation  jobs. The YCC can be traced back to President Roose- velt’s New Deal (Civilian Conservation Corps of the  1930s), responsible for much of New Mexico’s State  Park development and extensive work with the US For- est Service. The YCC is continuing this tradition by  providing trail crews for Open Space.  Now that school is in session, the YCC program will  continue through the cooperation of the APS Work  Study Program, which allows high school juniors and  seniors to take their classes in the morning and work in  the afternoon. A great deal of progress rebuilding and  stabilizing the trails at Elena Gallegos Picnic Area was  aided by these youths. So next time you see YCC out on  the trails, tell them to keep up the good work.  Trail maintenance  Maintaining those unpaved hiking, biking and horse  trails on Open Space lands is an ongoing job. Once a  trail is built, the bare soil is exposed to the erosive nat- ural forces of wind, water and time. It is important to  remember that erosion is a natural process which,  given enough time, can create a wonder such as the  Grand Canyon. But these natural forces are accelerated  by the actions of human use. We build trails in order to  minimize human impact on the landscape. By limiting  the access of users to designated trails, we are preserv- ing the rest of our environment. Please help us and fol- low some fundamentals of trail etiquette:  • Use only official designated trails. Do not create  your own trails!  • Remember most trails are multi-use. Be courteous  and share them.  • Mountain bikers should control speed at all times.  • All users should avoid going out on trails after  heavy rain or snow melt to minimize damage to  fragile soils.  Trail Closures and Reroutes on the Pino Trail  Certain unmaintainable trails were closed by the  Open Space Division and reroutes were built to provide  more stable treads. A mix of native grasses is planted  on old routes and keeping people off is the first step to  reclamation. If enough moisture reaches the seeds  (and this winter looks promising), the old trails should  be barely visible by summer.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
