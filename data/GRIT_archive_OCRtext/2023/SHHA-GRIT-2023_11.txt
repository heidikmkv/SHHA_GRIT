Stan Davis    The Sandia Mountains are notable for something that is  completely absent: ~1.1 billion years of “missing” rocks. This  “gap” in the rock record is called the Great Unconformity  (“GU”). The Utah Geological Society (J. Davis, 2018) defines  an unconformity nicely as “a break in time in an otherwise  continuous rock record. Unconformities are a type of geo- logic contact, a boundary between rocks caused by a period  of erosion or a pause in sediment accumulation, followed by  the deposition of sediments anew.” John Wesley Powell ob- served the GU in the depths of the Grand Canyon in 1869.  What makes this particular unconformity “Great,” is the ex- tremely large time gap of “missing” rocks and its large geo- graphic extent. New Mexico’s “most iconic” unconformity  (in the words of J. M. Timmons, NM Bur. of Geol. and Min.  Res., 2017) is the Great one at the top of the Sandia Moun- tains.    The GU has different characteristics between the Grand  Canyon and Sandia Mountains. In the Grand Canyon, the GU  is underlain by Paleoproterozoic metamorphic and igneous  rocks of the Yavapai tectonic province that formed ~1.75 to  1.80 billion years ago (Ga) as well as ancient “pre-Cambrian”  sedimentary rocks. In the Sandias, the Unconformity is un- derlain entirely by the Sandia Granite that about ~1.45 Ga in- truded older Mesoproterozoic metamorphic rocks of the  Mazatzal tectonic province (~1.65 Ga, see The GRIT, August  2023). Interestingly, there is an outcrop, not far away, on  the western flank of Cedro Peak (just south of Tijeras)  where the GU is underlain not by Sandia Granite, but by  these very Mazatzal metamorphic rocks (schists).    In the Grand Canyon, the GU is overlain immediately by a  thick succession of Paleozoic rocks starting with Cambrian- age sedimentary rocks. In the Sandias, the GU is overlain im- mediately by younger Pennsylvanian-age sedimentary rocks,  starting with the relatively thin Sandia Formation sand- stones (The GRIT, April 2023) followed by the thicker  Madera Group limestones (The GRIT, September 2023). The  thick sequence of early Paleozoic Cambrian through Missis- sippian sedimentary rocks resting on the GU in the Grand  Canyon is absent in the Sandias, because New Mexico dur- ing the early Paleozoic was mostly dry land where thick ac- cumulations of marine sediments were not even deposited,  until the Pennsylvanian shallow seas started inundating the  region. By that time the land surface had been eroded down  to essentially an undulating plain; the surface is known to  be not completely flat because the thickness of the overly- ing sandstones varies considerably as these sediments first  filled valleys and depressions before more-or-less blanket- ing the entire region.    Much more recent geologic events, such as the uplift of the  Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau, and subsequent ba- sin-and-range style rifting that formed the Albuquerque Ba- sin, induced widespread erosion of overlying rocks so that  the GU is now exposed at the surface in the Sandias. The GU  is encountered at road level on the eastern side of the low- ermost Crest Highway: as you are driving uphill you will see  tilting layers of sandstones and shales on your right as you  pass the Cienega/Sulphur turnoff, but by the time you reach  the Doc Long turnoff you will see granite – the GU is located  about halfway between the turnoffs. The GU is encoun- tered along all hiking trails that start down in the foothills  on the western side of the Sandias and climb up to the  Crest, such as along the uppermost stretches of the La Luz  and Embudito trails. But often the exact location can be  hard to find, owing to vegetation, forest debris and soils,  and limestone boulders that have tumbled down from  above, as well as weathering that can alter the appearance  of both the Sandia granite and overlying sandstones. When  viewed from below, the perspective makes it appear that  the layered limestones rest directly on the Sandia Granite.  Imagine this most “iconic” view of the Great Unconformity  in New Mexico is the view we have from our own Neighbor- hood. Great Scott!           This picture shows a view from the North Crest Trail looking  north to a prominent buttress along the North Crest. “Pre-  Cambrian” Sandia Granite is capped by the major erosion  surface of the Great Unconformity, which is overlain by  Pennsylvanian-age sandstones and, in turn, Pennsylvanian  limestones.  3   The GRIT – November 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 11    The Artist Next Door  Claudia Mitchell    This is the continuation of a series of articles highlight- ing the members of the Sandia Heights Artist, a group  of resident artists who support each other throughout  the year. They organize and participate in the annual  Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour held each Septem- ber. For more information.

Incredibly, they are all used by Charlotte Driver to  create color in some of the various types of pottery she  makes in her home studio.        Charlotte’s parents moved to Sandia Heights in 1976  from Texas. Charlotte and her husband followed 43  years later in 2019 after Charlotte had completed 26  years of active duty in the Army, and ten years in the De- partment of Defense. But that is getting ahead of our  story because Charlotte has always had the soul of an  artist. As a child, she loved to draw and paint, and at 16  she chose to attend the High School for the Performing  and Visual Arts (HSPVA) in Houston. “I had always been  an artistic and visual person and I LOVED it!” she ex- claimed. After graduation, she made a momentous life  choice to join the Army where she specialized in com- munications, and “did any artistic pursuit at work that I  could get my hands on plus painting in my free time.”  She did not have a lot of free time, raising five children,  earning a B.S in physics, two master’s degrees, and at- taining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. She went on to  have a second career in the Department of Defense  based at White Sands Missile Range. Her art had had to  take a back seat, but it was “re-energized when I retired  from the DOD.”     Charlotte’s retirement in 2019 expanded her free time.  She began watching the British TV series “The Great  Pottery Throw Down.” Her artistic spirit was rekindled  and as soon as possible she took a pottery class at New  Mexico Clay in Albuquerque. She bought a pottery  wheel. She started to take more local pottery classes  before the Covid pandemic closed classes in early 2020.  But that did not stop Charlotte’s study and active prac- tice of her newly found passion. She found that she  loved Neolithic pottery, and her work is greatly influ- enced by the textures, colors, and marks of this tech- nique. These ancient methods are not refined. They are  spontaneous and full of unpredictability. “The Neolithic  approach is earthy. I don’t mind getting dirty.”     Charlotte told me that she “likes to experiment.” She  creates several different types of pottery in her two  kilns: a large, electric kiln for traditional firing of func- tional stoneware; and her home-made, gas-fired,  smaller kiln for non-functional raku, obvara, and saggar  techniques. The firing times and temperatures used in  the gas-fired kiln vary and are critical to the success of  the pieces. The process is managed by her husband and  “kiln master,” Paul.     For example, the raku pieces are quickly fired, removed  red-hot from the gas kiln, and then plunged into “reduc- ing containers”—large metal buckets—containing  woodchips and newspaper. The resultant smoke and  fumes create unpredictable and beautiful finishes. “Ob- vara” is a raku process developed in Eastern Europe and  uses a thin slurry of the same ingredients as sourdough  bread which gives it its distinctive appearance. “Sag- gar” refers to pottery enclosed in a protective encase- ment while being fired. Charlotte uses aluminum foil for  her saggar and places the aforementioned banana  peels, and other materials inside to impart unexpected  colors and textures.

Charlotte found out about the Sandia Heights Artists soon  after she moved here from seeing a postcard in the mail. In  2020, she participated in her first tour that was held on a  limited basis following the pandemic protocols. She has par- ticipated in the tours the past three years and has enjoyed  limited basis following the pandemic protocols. She has par- ticipated in the tours the past three years and has enjoyed  working with the artists and their various activities including  the support of La Mesa Arts Academy in the International  District of Albuquerque. “I am inspired. It is like I make  something from nothing. The pieces are beautiful in their  rawness. I like that the energy that I put into each piece  evokes good feelings and people enjoy looking at it.” Char- lotte’s work can be viewed and purchased at the Lapis  Room gallery in Old Town Albuquerque or at   www.lapisroom.com    Marianne Bettinger  Glass is a hard, brittle solid made from melting natural ma- terials such as silica sand, soda ash and limestone, at very  high temperatures. The word “glass” comes from the Old  English word “glaes” which is derived from a Proto-Indo-Eu- ropean root that means “to shine.”     Marianne Bettinger is a glass artist, and her work definitely  shines. Marianne was born and grew up in The Netherlands.  In 1982 she moved with her American husband to  Albuquerque as he began his internship at UNM. Eventually,  as the family got larger, they outgrew their small house.  They knew about Sandia Heights and had thought of living  here. They loved the meandering lanes, views, and wildlife.  When a real estate friend took them to look at houses in  1992, she showed them the Sandia Heights house where  Marianne lives today. It was the first house they looked at  and the one they immediately wanted. When they bought it  and went to look at it again, the meandering lanes became  a maze: they could not find it! Eventually, Marianne was able  to find her house without a map and she kept very busy rais- ing her three children.     But this dedicated mom was also an artist at heart. “I’ve  been doing artsy things since I was tiny.” Her Dutch gram- mar school allowed 1 ½ hours for lunch. Marianne took that  opportunity every weekday to go visit her grandmother.  “My grandmother did anything and everything related to  clothing and fabric, and she showed me how to do them.  She knitted, crocheted, did needlepoint and embroidery.  She quilted and sewed and made her own patterns. I tried  to learn everything I could.” Marianne’s aunt had a whole- sale fabric business and Marianne gleaned swatches and  remnants-- “I loved it!” This early interest in fabric and art  continued through high school leading to a degree from the  University of Utrecht in art and art history. During her uni- versity studies she became intrigued by glass art.     Her children grew up and Marianne had time to nurture her  artistic side. In 2012, while visiting her son, then a student at  the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, he  took her to the Dale Chihuly “hot shop.” She was com- pletely entranced. In 2013, her son-in-law invited her to  come to Corpus Christi, Texas to visit his mother, a glass art- ist, and “play with glass.” She was hooked. She flew home,  turned around and went to the Glass Expo in Las Vegas. She  came home with a kiln. Next stop, Bullseye Glass Resource  Center in Santa Fe for materials, supplies, and instruction.  Marianne’s career was launched.     In 2017, Marianne discovered that her long-time neighbor,  Ron Lohrding, had been a glass artist for years, specializing  in dichroic glass. He suggested that she join him as a mem- ber of Sandia Heights Artists. There she found camaraderie  and an outlet for selling her accumulating work at their an- nual studio tour. After a year with the group, she became  their secretary and still is.     Marianne’s medium is technically classified as “warm glass”  since the glass is heated in a kiln at 1275–1500°F for 15 to 36  hours as opposed to “hot glass” worked in a direct flame  furnace between 1100–2000F.

The pro- cess is complex and technical based on the physical proper- ties of glass when heated and cooled. She noted that “Igno- rance is not bliss when working with glass. You have to  know the rules and follow them.”       But even following the rules can result in surprises. Mari- anne explained that you don’t 100% know what will come  out of the kiln, that every piece is different. That element of  surprise is one of the many aspects of the work that has  kept Marianne engaged in working with glass for the past  ten years. “I am still considered a newbie. It takes decades  to master glass work. I will never learn it all. Fiber is forgiv- ing, but glass is the opposite and I love that challenge. You  must keep focused, but it is not stressful. Handling the glass,  creating the designs from the endless combinations of  color, transparency, opacity, and textures, I find myself in a  Zen-like state. But sometimes complete accidents can be- come the most beautiful pieces.”     When asked what she is expressing with her glass pieces she  immediately responded, “Joy! I do this because I truly enjoy  it. If it makes other people happy…that’s great!” You can  see and purchase smaller pieces of Marianne’s work at vari- ous holiday shows in the area.

SHHA’s Neighborhood Afternoon Out and Ice Cream  Social was a big hit Sunday, September 24th. Over  150 residents of all ages – as well as several dogs -  enjoyed ice cream sundaes, games, and a beautiful  afternoon in the park. The purpose was to build a  stronger sense of community, educate on home  safety and wildfire preparedness, and encourage  participation in Neighborhood Watch.                                    The Community Service & Membership Committee  (CS&M) worked alongside E&S to provide a few  games as well as ice cream with all the fixings. SHHA  Board members Eric Faulring, Arthur Romero, Clau- dia Mitchell, and (retired) Bob Thomas, as well as  E&S volunteer Julie Rochman, scooped ice cream,  cheerily welcoming all who came through the line.                                             Some of our younger  residents learned how  to hula-hoop, a few  families played corn  hole and croquet, and  Kathleen McCaughey  emceed sack races, re- warding the winners  with small prizes.  Firefighters from  our nearby Berna- lillo County Station  35, Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s De- partment Deputy  Boyce Berry, and a  crew from Sandia  Heights Services Se- curity, all re- sponded to our invi- tation from the  SHHA Environment  & Safety (E&S)  Committee, and  came with equip- ment, vehicles, and  lots of information.  E&S member Cheryl  Wieker manned the  Wildfire Table.    13 The GRIT – November 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 11 14   The GRIT – November 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 11          SANDIA PEAK UTILITY TO BEGIN WATER   METER REPLACMENT PROJECT      As Sandia Peak Utility Company  previously  announced it has received an award of American  Rescue Plan Act funding from Bernalillo County with  the help of Bernalillo County Commissioner Walt  Benson.  The Company will be using the total award of  $3,335,325 to replace aged water meters and service  lines in the Sandia Heights and Primrose Pointe  service areas. The meter replacement portion of the  project is scheduled to begin mid-September 2023.  The work is anticipated to continue through the fall  and early winter.      The company will be replacing it’s entire 2,500 water  meters with new AMI water meters that come  equipped with advanced technology, including leak  detection capabilities. This system will enable meter  readings, usage, and leak data to be sent to an AMI  cellular network. This data can be accessed from your  home or office through a user portal called  “EyeOnWater”. The company will also be able to view  meter reading data without the need to manually  read a meter. The AMI system will provide the  company with near real-time meter data reporting,  including current volume and alerts such as leaks,  bursts, reverse flows, and high/low ambient  temperatures in the meter can.     Replacing aged meters is only the first step in this  project. Following the replacing of the aged meters,  the company will also replace the oldest and most  troublesome service lines in the area.   The Company has been working closely with a County  Project Team set up to ensure that the project  remains on track and is successful. The Company also  has a professional team and contractor in place to  shepherd the installation of the meters through to  completion.            This project will have a significant impact on the effort  to reduce unidentifiable water loss and thus conserve  water. Without American Rescue Plan Act funding,  these projects would take several decades to  complete.   The company appreciates the support provided by the  County towards our effort to provide a long-term  sustainable water system to the residents of Sandia  Heights and Primrose Pointe and encourages you to  take advantage of the new AMI water meters portal  that will be made available to you. The Companys  website www.sandiaheightsservices.com will offer  the ability to sign up for this option which is called  “Eye on Water”.                        15   The GRIT – November 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 11      16   The GRIT – November 2023 – Volume 39 – No. 11
