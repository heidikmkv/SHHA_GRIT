'.. 11  Message From The President  -- Bill Stabler, '90-'91 SHHA President  Are you mad as #*!#?  We are! The officers and directors of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association are frustrated at the expenditure of Association funds necessitated  by covenant problems in our community.  You know whom I'm talking about. The residents -- SHHA members and  nonmembers alike -- who feel that the Declarations of Restrictions don't apply  to them. These are your neighbors with boats and campers in their driveways  month after month; the residents who installed satellite discs and didn't bother  to screen them; the homes with wire fences and wire dog runs; the do-it- yourselfers who keep piles of construction debris around their houses; the  families who park inoperable vehicles at their houses for years; and the people  who construct walls, fences, and additions without going through the  architectural review process.  There also are the property owners of our community who design houses and  additions that don't comply with the covenants and then pressure the SHHA  Architectural Control Committee for approval to build them.  Six months into this fiscal year, the SHHA already has spent several thousand  dollars on covenant enforcement. The time and expenses for monthly covenant  inspection tours, clerical time and expenses for preparing an average of 30  covenant violation letters per month, postage and copying costs, and attorneys'  fees not only consume a substantial percentage of members' dues but also a  tremendous amount of time and mental energy of the Board of Directors. This  is time, money, and energy that could be expended on community  beautification, park improvements, or other projects to enhance our quality of  life in Sandia Heights.  ,  Still, what's the main reason cited by residents for not joining the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association or for resigning their membership? It's their  perception of the SHHA's failure to "do its job" in the area of covenant  enforcement. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association is a non-profit  New Mexico corporation comprising residents who voluntarily join and then  elect 15 members to serve on the Board of Directors. The formation and  existence of the SHHA is not stipulated in the Declaration of Restrictions.  Consequently, it follows that the Association is not required to perform any  specific duties (including architectural review and covenant enforcement).  Many a time the Board of Directors has asked itself why the SHHA has agreed  to take on these disagreeable and thankless tasks.  Over the years, the SHHA has cleared up numerous covenant problems,  altered many construction plans to meet the comm unity's covenants and design  standards, and mediated a wide variety of conflicts between neighbors. But the  problem is obvious. Covenant enforcement for a community of 1,500 residents  is not a job that can be successfully handled by 15 volunteer Board members and  one Executive Assistant to the homeowners association. It's a task that requires  community participation and cooperation in order to be effective and  successful.

If you're uninformed about the  covenants in your subdivision (Sandia  Heights currently has 32 subdivisions and  32 different sets of covenants), get a copy  of the applicable covenants for your area  and read them. There also are several  articles in this issue of The GRIT to  inform you about various legal issues and  new procedures pertaining to· covenant  enforcement.  If you have a covenant problem in your  area, take the initiative to talk to the  homeowner or tenant in a neighborly  fashion about the issue. All too often we  hear, "My neighbors don't seem to care,  so why doesn't the Association get off my  back?"  If you're not a member of the  Association, become a member and get  involved.

Judges Name Holiday Lights Contest Winners  "With the judges festively piled into a  four wheel drive vehicle, we cruised the  snow covered streets of Sandia Heights to  select winners of the 1990 SHHA  Holiday Lights Contest," reports Rich  Bando, member of the SHHA Parks and  Recreation Committee and one of the  contest judges.  Even though there were only seven  official entries in the contest, Rich says  any home that the judges passed that had  decorations was considered as a potential  prize winner.  Winner of the luminaria category was  18 Juniper Hill Loop, the home of Andy  and Judith Anderson. Andy reportedly  braved the elements to set out and light  250 luminarias.  In the traditional lights category, the  winner was 569 Black Bear Rd., the home  of Kathy and Gary Williams. Gary says  he spent eight hours decorating his home,  and it was time well spent according to  the judges.  Second place winner in the traditional  category was 483 Live Oak Loop, home of  Ina and William Swantner.  The Andersons and the Williamses  each received $75 award checks from the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Associa- tion and the Swantners received a $25  award.  Honorable Mentions in the traditional  lights category were James and Susan  Smuda, 955 Antelope Ave.; Paul and  Isabelle Bradley, 33 Cedar Hill Pl.;  George Johnson and Rachel Garcia, 802  TramwayLn.

Page8  Composting Lets Nature Do The Work  Bill Heflin  SHHA Recycling Director  Editor's Note:  The Association's  Recycling Committee has set community  education as one of its primary goals. The  foil owing article is the first in a series on  various recycling topics.  Nearly 30 percent of garbage in the  United States consists of yard or garden  waste and kitchen scraps. This <lll10unts  to some 24 million tons of waste iach year  which, if composted and returned to our  gardens as humus, would enrich the soil  and save millions of cubic yards of land  fill.  Composting is simple and nature does  most of the work!  To start, a composting pile or pit is  needed. Dr. Lynn Doxon, a local garden  columnist and consultant, recommends  that a pit be used here in our dry climate.  However, the compost process requires  air circulation to work properly and a pile  that can be turned from time to time will  permit more air to circulate and may be  easier to handle.  For the Heflin  household, I made a three-section  composting bin out of 2X4's, galvanized  hardware cloth, and removable 1X4's in  the front openings. Each section will hold  about a cubic yard of material. I treated  the wood parts with a preservative. The  materials cost about $130 and took about  six hours to build.  Composting is a process that occurs  constantly in nature as vegetation falls to  the ground, slowly decays, and returns  the minerals and nutrients needed by the  soil, plants, and small creatures. :Aerobic  composting speeds up the process which  can take as little as two or three weeks or  as long as a year depending uponthe care  given. The Portland, Oregon booklet,  The Art of Composting, says that rapid  de com position  results  from  a  combination of the following ingredients:  Raw organic material (inclµding a  good source of nitrogen, such as grass,  weeds, manure, and bloodmeal),  moisture, air, heat (generated through  rapid decomposition), and organisms  present in the soil.  In the composting process, bacteria  and other organisms attack plants and  other organic materiai. Bacteria break  organic matter into a dark-brown  substance called humus. Humus, rich in  nutrients and minerals, is an excellent soil  conditioner. Humus increases a garden's  productivity by breaking up heavier soils  and improving fertility.  It also  contributes to a plentiful harvest.  The compost pile should be built in  layers. This helps ensure a proper mix of  nitrogen and carbon-rich carbohydrates  (which later aid in air circulation). The  first layer should be absorbent material  to prevent juices from running out the  bottom of the bin. Sawdust or crushed  dry leaves are good for this.  Add  successive layers of at least three  different materials, with one layer being  a material rich in composting bacteria  and enzymes (garden soil or manure).  Other layers should alternate between  green matter like grass clippings and  leaves and carbon-rich carbohydrates  like shredded prunings, small twigs,  branches, and dried leaves.  Each  complete pile should be at least three  cubic feet in size to guarantee sufficient  heat generation.  Kitchen scraps can be introduced with  the carbon material. This will prevent the  scraps from smelling during the initial  composting stages.  Between each completed system of  layers, water should be added to maintain  sufficient moisture content. The pile  should not be soaked, but watered to the  consistency of a wrung-out sponge.  While the material should be moist, it  should still crumble when balled up in  your fist. Wood ashes can be added to  each system of layers -- about one coffee  can by volume per layer. Kitchen scraps,  pet hair, vacuum sweepings, and other  organics also can be added to completed  layers.  The frequency of turning com post piles  depends on how soon the compost is  needed. Fast composting can take as  little as two weeks using the aerobic  composting method. Slower composting  usually is done during the winter months  and requires much less turning. With any  system, however, turning the pile  periodically is essential to maintain the  air supply to the aerobic bacteria working  on the material.  Aerobic composting can heat as high as  180 degrees in the center. This may be  noted by thrusting a broom handle into  the compost pile. Letit stay afewminutes  and withdraw. The handle will feel quite  warm to the touch when the pile is  working properly.  Albuquerque Solid Waste Manage- ment has a project to use sludge from the  waste recovery plant and organic  materials to produce humus. The plant is  located on the West Mesa near the  Double Eagle Airport. It is expected that  the City Parks Department will use most  of the humus produced, and none will be  offered for sale within the near future.  Solid Waste will also send out a copy of  the Portland booklet on composting that  was previously mentioned if you give  them a call at 761-8176. The booklet gives  more information on composting along  with drawings of several composting piles  that can be used by the householder.  Reading this booklet, you also will  discover how liberally I borrowed from it  for this article.

Page 12  i  Coalition Appeals Master Plan Approval  Approval by the County Zoning  Commission of the Master Plan for the  proposed Primrose Pointe subdivision  has been appealed by the : North  Albuquerque Sandia Heights Coalition  (NASHC). The Coalition's appeal was  presented at the January meeting of  Bernalillo County Commission (see  editor's note below).  The Coalition, which coniprises  residents from both the iNorth  Albuquerque Acres and Sandia B:eights  communities, retained Herb Dehish &  Associates, a real estate consultuig firm,  to present their objections regar~g the  Primrose Pointe Master Plan to the  County Commission.  ',  Bob Williams, SHHA's Director of  New Development and a member of the  Coalition, said that the Coalition's  objections to the Primrose Pointe Master  Plan centered around the developbent's  proposed  housing  density,:  the  probability of assessments within the  North Albuquerque Acres community to  pay for the construction of water and  sewer lines, height of the homes ,within  the development, drainage concerns, and  traffic flow within and around the  Primrose Pointe subdivision.  Bob reported that the City of  Albuquerque Utility Development  Division now has specified that sewer line  extensions for the Primrose Pointe  development must be designed and  constructed to accommodate future use  by the entire Sandia Heights community.  Residents in Sandia Heights who joined  the NASHC expressed concern that all  the recent negative publicity about septic  tanks may bring City sewer service  sooner than anyone had anticipated,  along with sizeable assessments to  property owners to cover the cost ofline  extensions.  Editor's Note:  Since the Bernalillo  County Commission meeting occurred  after The GRJT's publication deadline,  results of the Coalition's appeal were not  available for this issue. SHHA members  who want infonnation about the meeting's  results may contact Bob Williams (292- 4949) or the SHHA office (275-9112).

Three pickup loads of glass  and one pickup full of plastic also were  collected.  Six members of the Association's  Recycling Committee, along with SHHA  President Bill Stabler, reportedly had a  steady flow of depositors from 9 a.m. to  12noon.

Our Sandia Heights' skies are crisp and  clear, and the weather's not tod cold. So bundle up, and  go out for a look.  ·  Looking south, the most faiPiliar starry sight is the  great Hunter, the constellation Orion. He is easily  identified by the three stars in pis belt. The bright star  in his right shoulder is named Betelgeuse (pronounced  Beetle-juice!). This star is a vJry cool (compared with  our Sun) red supergiant which may have swallowed up its  small companion star. IfBetelg~use were where our Sun  is, it's edge would reach to the orbit of Mars.  The bright blue star in Orion~ s left knee is Rigel (Ri' - jel). Rigel is also a supergiant st~r but many times hotter  than our Sun. Both of these stars of the winter sky are  about 1400 light years away from us. A light year is the  distance light light travels in one year, about 6 trillion  miles.  Just to the right (west) of Orion is the easily identified  constellation, Taurus, the Bull; The V-shaped pattern  you see represents his face. : The brightest star is  Aldebaran (al-deb' -run), a giant orange starnot as old as  Betelgeuse but older than Rigel. Aldebaran represents  the fiery eye of the Bull. It's bright mostly because it is  only 60 light years away. The red planet, Mars, is just  north (above) Aldebaran. If you don't have a telescope,  hold some binoculars steady and look at Mars. It doesn't  seem to twinkle like the stars. ·  ,•  -,.  I  I -·  H!~ON  !

The constellation  ORION is always found in the southern sky.  To examine the northern sky stand  facing north.  Turn the chart "upside down" with NORI'fl facing the way you' re  looking.  CP.SSIOPEIA is always somewhere in the northern sky.  Good luck! And  enjoy the sky!  Part of this constellation is a tiny group of faint stars shaped like a little "dipper." See if you can find these stars. They are called  the Pleiades or the "Seven Sisters". Look very hard to find all seven. With a telescope or binoculars, you may see even more than  seven. Since the only time you' can see Orion and Taurus is in the winter, go see. The sky is free.
