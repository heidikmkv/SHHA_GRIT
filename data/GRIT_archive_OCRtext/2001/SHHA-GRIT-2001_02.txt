THE  Sandia Heigh ts Homeowners Association  February-March 2001  No Trucks On Tramway  A Letter From County Commissioner  Tim Cummins  Dear Sandia Heights Neighbors:  I look forward to serving as your County Commissioner for the next.four years. I have enjoyed having the  opportunity to meet neighbors, discuss issues and the community and I am anxious to continue doing so.  There have been ongoing concerns that at some point, over-the-road trucks may be allowed on Tramway as  a bypass, but this can never happen. As a City Councilor, I worked with Conunissioner Barbara Seward on this issue  and we were able to determine that due to a combination of Federal Regulations, deed restrictions and restrictions  from Sandia Pueblo, over-the-road trucks will never be allowed.  The Urban County Charter Commission, chaired by Barbara Seward is also represented by Sandia Heights  resident, Ray Padilla, a local attorney. The work of the Commission seems to be going well. I encourage anyone in- terested in the process to visit the Bernalillo County web page at www.bernco.gov for agendas and meeting notes.  Should you have any questions please contact Lena Gonzales, Administrative Assistant at 768-4253.  Thank you for your vote of confidence in me to represent you .  .Yim~  Commissioner, District IV  Editors note: for more detailed information  about over-the-road trucks on Tramway see:  OVER-THE-ROAD-TRUCKS on page 2  Bernalillo County Home Rule  By David S. Campbell, UCCC Vice Chair  Last November 7th, New Mexicans voted to  amend the state's constitution to allow Bernalillo  County and Albuquerque to begin a process of govern- mental reform. By enacting Constitutional Amendment  #1, New Mexicans granted Bernalillo County voters the  right to form an "urban county", and further, to form a  single urban government including Albuquerque.  Creating an "urban county" does not in any way  mean the elimination of rural areas. It is a designation  used to describe the predominantly metropolitan nature  of Bernalillo County, and to allow the county to adopt a  home rule charter. "Home rule" is the legal authority  for a local government to create its 0~11 structure and  form of government as set forth in a charter, or constitu- tion. Deciding whether Bernalillo County should adopt  home rule powers is just the first decision to be made in  what may be an eventual unification of city and county  governments. Each of these decisions will be made by  the voters of Bernalillo County.  The Bernalillo County Commission has now  appointed a group of citizens to begin drafting an Urban  County Charter. The Charter Commission is meeting  regularly to draft a proposed charter for county govern- ment. At a series of public hearings, input will be taken.  The Commission will recommend a new government  structure, which may include recreating our legislative  body. There will be vigorous debate about how many  districts we need to have good representation; whether  we should have special districts for the east mountain  area or south valley; whether the functions of County  government should be expanded. Hearings will be held  in the next few weeks throughout the County.  The  Charter Commission welcomes public input on the form  and function of a new County government.  Times and dates for scheduled public hearings  of the Urban County Charter Commission will be found  under URBAN COUNTY CHARTER COMMISSION  on page 6.

Mr. Christ- man cannot make commitments for SHHA without prior agree- ment by the Board of Directors on the subject, however, he is the  point of contact for all matters regarding Cedar Hill Park. His  responsibilities will include participation, as necessary, in plan- ning meetings with the County and others, and reporting to the  SHHA Board of Directors and the SHHA New Development  and Parks Committee on issues and progress on the park. Mr.  Christman was selected for this position due to his insight,  knowledge, and established leadership among his neighbors re- garding the park.  Mr. Christman reported to the SHHA Board of Directors the  good news of successful meetings with the County on January  18, 2001, and on February 8, 2001. Mr. Christman has worked  extensively on seeing Cedar Hill Park become a reality and is  looking forward to continuing to work on the project.  Please direct all communication regarding Cedar Hill Park to  Mr. Christman at:  7745 Cedar Canyon Rd., NE  Telephone: 505-856-7636  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Fax: 505-856-7360  E-mail: rccabq@aol.com  SHHA AGAIN HAS RECEIVED  "RECOGNITION STATUS" WITH .  BERNALILLO COUNTY  a  . .  . .  Dear Sandia Heights Homeowners Association:  We have received your Annual Report of Recognized  Neighborhood Criteria.  The documents are in compliance  with the Bernalillo County Neighborhood Association Rec- ognition and Notification Ordinance #94-4. We are pleased  to inform your association of its "Recognition Status" with  Bernalillo County.  Thank you for your continued support and participation in  your community.  Sincerely,  Enrico Gradi, Program Planner  Cedar Hill Park Status Report  .bg Bo.b ChnstmdII  The County expended $635,000 to purchase land at Cedar  Hill Road and Tramway Blvd to build a new park adjacent to  the Tramway path. The voters approved the required bond  issue for funding in November.  The county requested $350,000 from the state legislature  to design and develop the park. This capital outline project  has been requested by Representative Robert M Burpo.  The owner intended to build a housing development on the  3.75 acre property but SHHA worked with the county to en- courage the purchase of the land for a park. This effort  spanned about 5 years of meetings and discussions that led to  a successful conclusion.  The county realized the area is underserved due to the  population expansion in the Northeast. Future discussions for  other locations in the Northeast will cover a community cen- ter, senior center, library and open space.  The County Parks Department met with the architects to  discuss proceeding with the design of the park in accordance  with the Cedar Canyon neighborhood requests submitted in  March 2000. At that time a request was made to the county to  limit the park to less than an acre and the remaining portion of  the property would be left in it's natural state to provide open  space and views.  The County Parks Department has also met with SHHA,  the architects and the neighborhood representatives at the job- - site and the SHHA Office, to confirm the timing and status of - this project.  The County has indicated that schedules depend on fund- ing. As mentioned above, the state legislature has to provide  funding for the park to proceed. If funding is received this  year, designing will begin in 2001 and construction in 2002.  Representative Robert M. Burpo's bill for $350,000.00  to design and develop a neighborhood park in Sandia  Heights is:  HC641HOUSE CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST 641  STATE OF NEW MEXICO  45TH LEGISLATURE-FIRST SESSION-2001  Let Representative Burpo know of your support for  this park funding .

Bannowsky, Committee Chair  Your ACC committee was busy  over the Holidays. In the last two months, 21 applica- tions have been submitted, one for construction of a new  residence and all others for additions, renovations, re- pair, or maintenance involving painting, stucco, trim or  window replacement. The members of the Architectural  Control Committee (ACC) have continued to devote  significant personal time to the ongoing objective of  maintaining the unique architectural character of Sandia  Heights. In an effort to aid in a common understanding  of the legal responsibilities of, and the processes utilized  by the ACC, you will see overviews of some of these  processes in this column in upcoming months.  A very high level review of the application, review  and approval process is the initial topic. First, a caution  that in Sandia Heights there are more than 30 different  units or phases, each with slightly different Restrictive  Covenants, so your neighbor may be governed by differ- ent legal requirements than you are. Any questions can  be directed to an ACC member with a quick telephone  call to tlie SHHA office. Prior to commencement of any  new construction, exterior modification, or landscaping,  an application must be submitted to the ACC. Applica- tion forms are available at the SHHA office on San  Rafael, the drop box at Sandia Services Company office  on Tramway Road, or oniine at:  http:www.sandiahomeowners.org/  Application fees and simple directions are included  in the forms. Applications are reviewed by the commit- tee and are typically approved or disapproved within 30  days of receipt. The primary considerations the com- mittee applies to the review process are: Compliance  with the Declaration of Restrictions for the appropri- ate unit, Color and style compatibility with the sur- roi:nding area, Potential view blockage of surrounding  neighbors, and Encroachment on the privacy of  neighbors.  Some reduction in existing views or incremental loss  of privacy is a possibility with any new construction.  While every owner of an undeveloped lot or existing  home in Sandia Heights has a right to build or modify a  residence, when construction of a home or an addition  creates the potential to significantly, unduly, or unneces- s~ly impact the views or privacy of surrounding  neighbors, a Neighborhood Review may be held. This  review affords neighbors the opportunity to view con- struction plans and offer comments to the ACC for con- sideration. This Neighborhood Review is a non-legal  notification from the ACC administrative office advis- ing neighbors of the application and the time and place  for viewing the plans, typically over a five day period at  the San Rafael office. Neighbors have five days from  the review deadl41e to offer any comments, in writing,  to ACC. Forms are available for these comments.  The ACC reviews and considers any comments and  makes a final decision on the project application. This  decision may or may not concur with any specific input  £i:om a neighbor but represents an impartial judgment  given all the variables which exist in any given situa- tion. Notification of this decision is made to any  neighbors who offered input.  .  Again, a reminder that the Declarations of Restric- tions vary from unit to unit. Lack of knowledge regard- mg the specific provisions contained in the applicable  Declaration of Restrictions can be a source of confusion  and misunderstanding. Please feel free to contact the  SHHA office at 797-7793 with any questions you may  have or to request a copy of the Covenants for your unit.  You may also contact the Chair of this committee from  our website: www.sandiahomeowners.org/  ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  SHHA'S NEW WEB SITE  ·;·;·_"'fialtJ  ..  ,~_"":.  By: Harris Goodwin,  , Bf  '"  Communications Committee  Sandia Heights has a new WEB page.  On February 1st of this year SHHA  launched a new web site for the residents of our commu- nity. We have done a lot of work to bring our new page  up to date both in design and content. We also have a  new Domain name, just point your Browser to www.  sandiahomeowners.org/ and enjoy: We also reserved  the .net and .com domains for future use. If you use  the .com or .net extension you will also end up at the  Sandia Heights Domain. Our new Domain is hosted by  one of the best servers in the state and for the tech type  people we have dual redundant backbones with both  UUNet and Qwest. The Communications Committee  encourages you to visit the site and send your construc- tive criticisms to the Webmaster; the committee will  compile these suggestions and revise the site as neces- sary. Our goal is to keep the site current and pertinent  to the Community as a whole. You will note that you  may address e-mail directly to any Officer or Committee  if you have concerns or comments regarding Commu- nity or SHHA issues. Our first revision to the site will  in~lude putting all SHHA forms on lin~ in PDF format,  this means you will be able to download and print an  exact copy of the form, which will save you a trip to the  office to pick one up. We look forward to Members and  residents visiting the new site:  www .sandiahomeowners.org/  A Bi-Monthly Publication  Page 6  The Grit  TRAFFIC AND SAFETY COMMITTEE  Chair: Glenn Kuswa  The Safety Committee wants your opinion. Most of our residents have experienced some degree of discom:  fort or even terror while exiting our driveways or walking on our streets. Visibility is poor, access to the shoulder is  often limited by overgrowth of vegetation, and motorists seldom come close to driving at speeds close to the posted  limits. The hazard to children. who frequently don't stop to anticipate the potential for accidents, is probably much  greater than for adults. And we need to consider the elderly, and a few physically challenged citizens who navigate  the streets in wheel chairs or special pedal carts. There are several actions we can take, and we want to assure that the  directions we recommend are most suited to our constituents in Sandia Heights. The· Safety committee will consider  plans to ask the county to clear some overgrowth near the roadways. In most cases there is an easement that permits  such action, but we are aware that some residents oppose such action on esthetic grounds. We would like to hear  from you on how best to balance our actions.  Vegetation control--especially along roads-- is also a concern for fire safety, not only from the standpoint of  combustible materials, but because it obscures hydrants and forces parking in ways that restrict passage of emergency  vehicles.  Another remedy is to organize local petitions to iristall more speed humps. Some say this slows emergency  vehicles, while others see this as a feasible solution to control daily hazards to some extent. Speed humps will likely  be a more local street-by-street issue under rules set by the county requiring local approval of residents. Let us  have your opinion. Send your response to the SHHA, P.O.

This movie depicted what it would be like  in the year 2001, men controlled by computers, moon bases, shuttles to space stations, and people moving to far and  distant places and adopting their standards to the "New World." I saw the movie, it was different for the times and  made me think of the future and what it would be like. I certainly did not believe this fantasy representation of life in  2001 anymore than I believed everything that was written in the newspapers or talked about on the evening news.  Also in 1968, or there about, a group of men were developing a new subdivision just outside the city limits of Al- buquerque - it was called Sandia Heights. I never spoke to these people, never even met them, and so anything I am  about to say is speculation on my pait, like the producer of the space odyssey movie.  The developers envisioned a subdivision unlike others. A place that was rural in nature, yet close to the conven- iences of the city. There was no plan for straight streets with several houses per acre, nor were there plans for street- lights, curbs, and sidewalks. Because they lived in the desert, lawns and other water-guzzling plants were to be kept  to a minimum. In general, the landscaping was to be kept to natural vegetation where practical. They also wrote  deed restrictions known as covenants to maintain the uniqueness of Sandia Heights.  When I moved to Sandia Heights in 1983, I knew it was developed, but the openness was far more than I had seen  in other places I had lived. I got used to the fact that I "lived in the countty" and liked it. Similar to the producer of  the space odyssey movie, I had absolutely no idea what life would really be like in 2001.  The point is this: our population in New Mexico has increased by 8% over the past decade. Sandia Heights has  been all but built up. There are very few building lots left. There are more than 30 different sets of covenants. The  Tram Company does not enforce the covenants nor do they plow the roads when it snows. The Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association has taken on the responsibility of covenant enforcement and the county plows the roads.  People have moved here from all over the world and all want a little bit of what they left behind, I guess to remind  them of home.  It is unfortunate that in the developers' original plan they may have left a few things out - a community center  would have been nice, maybe large tracts of open space could have been set aside. The point is this did not happen,  so we are living in a place that does not have some of the things that other areas have, yet Sandia Heights has a lot of  things that other places do not have.  In my last column, I stated why I live in Sandia Heights and why I got involved with the SHHA. I did not move  here because I wanted to change everything after the place was built up. I had a choice where I wanted to live and I  made that choice.  One very important thing does require change, our driving habits. SLOW DOWN! We don't want our impa- tience to save five minutes to end up injuring or killing pedestrians on our roadways.  Thanks for all you have done to support our efforts to get to where we are as your homeowner's association. I  hope your 2001 turns out like you planned and not like a space odyssey.

As we look forward to the upcoming Annual Meeting, we are re- questing that persons who are interested in serving on the Board of Directors contact the SHHA office.  Directors are elected annually by a majority vote of the General Membership at the Annual Meeting in June.  Directors serve for a term of three years. There is an attempt on the part of the nominating committee to have repre- sentation from each district. The criteria for selection are that you are a member of the association, that you want to  contribute to keeping Sandia Heights a 'unique' place to live, and that you do not have a 'single agenda' of what  needs to be done, but are interested in the overall support of the homeowners.  With the positions being vacated by expiring terms, there are some particular areas that will need to be filled.  There is no representative of Sandia Heights North. The Communications Committee will need persons with an  interest in the organization of social function as well as our publications.

If you would like to be considered for a position on the Board of Directors, please call the SHHA office.  You will be asked to submit a short biography.

For example, SHHA will not intercede in dis- -'  -..... "'putes between neighbors. We are providing you the following information to assist you with  ..  those things SHHA cannot help solve.  If your neighbor has outdoor lighting that sheds light onto your property this may be a covenant violation in  your unit. SHHA recommends that you talk to you neighbor about the problem, and if they do not correct the situa- tion you may have grounds to take legal action. For help with lighting issues contact Monica Otero, Bernalillo  County Zoning Department at -924-3700.  Complaints that are not the responsibility of SHHA can be directed to the following contacts:  •  Cars parked illegally in the street right of way and noise (Bernalillo County has strict laws regarding  noise) - County Sheriff- 768-4160  •  Graffiti. Graffiti Removal Hotline - 768-4400.  •  Problems regarding animals. County Animal Control - 873-6706.  •  Vegetation causing visibility problems at street intersections (a violation of County Zoning Ordinance  #213). County Zoning Enforcement - 924-3700.  Always feel free to call the SHHA office at - 797-7793, and if the staff cannot help you with your concern they will  probably be able to direct you to the proper authority. Also, Sandia Heights Security-263-4654 can often help you  with your problem.
