THE __ ,LAST HURRAH  This message  will be  the last  I write as President  of the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association. I  have deliberated  for many  (at least a  few> hours  over what  the content  should be.  I think the best manner in  which to  conclude this year is to recap  the highlights  and the people  responsible for them.  First of  all, let  me state unequivocally that this year's Board has  worked so hard that they all  deserve promotions,  raises, and salutations  of the  highest· order.  Judy  Harris has  for years  endured the agony of  publishing The  Grit and  has continued  her tremendous  efforts with this  year's  publication  <especially  her  astute  hounding  of  me  to get my  article in - always the last item she waits for>.  Bill  Jackson has done  a super  job as  my backup  and also  in his expertise of dealing with the  various city/county agencies and keeping us  advised on  the Tramway Blvd.  situation.  Don McBride  is a  true yeoman as Secretary, for he has taken  copious notes at each meeting and then typed and distributed  them to each  Board member  for review  prior to the next meeting.  Dennis Burt, as our  Treasurer, is superlative.  Not  only  was  this his first  year  on the  Board.  but  he  stepped  in  and revamped our bookkeeping system~ monthly  reports, and made the whole billing transition work.  Hats off to the Membership  Committee  <Lynne  Behnfield  and Carolyn  Hudson>  who  almost  worked  themselves  out  of  a  job with Association  membership at an alltime high (1018 members and still growing>.  Addition- ally, Lynne  was primarily responsible for the new Sandia Heights bulletin  board and Carolyn is in charge of the upcoming Spring Fling.  Roger Hoppe  has  provided  valuable service  in  the  area  of  Covenants Control and  working on the Jogging Path along with  Mike  Cox.  Mike  has  also been  responsible for  conjuring up the idea of implementing the new park tables  and benches.  Harry Ottinger has assisted in  advising us  with our street  and highway problems and Jim Randall has completed the efforts in mobiliz- ing the pro-gas movement in Sandia Heights.  Hospitality hasn't been the  same since  Ralph Tate  and Sara Warford  took over  last year.  Ralph has visited each new arrival to our neighbor- hood and Sara has done everything to deserve  her title as the ''workhorse  of tt-re  Boat-d."  She has  almost singlehandedly  organized people to have  coffees, New Year's Eve progressive parties,  the Wine  Tasting and Brunch  at the  Theater functions  and in  general done  tons of  behind the scene  work and kept a great attitude all the while.  Jack Wirtz, as our newest Board member, has  jumped in  and agreed to  be  our  first-ever  Sandia  Heights  Board  member  an  the Architectural  Control Committee.  He's a gread addition to the Board •  ... Continued on Page 3 .••  TH I RD  f!N~_1J_AL §PR I NG FL I NG At'1D MI hi I TR I AT HAL,. ON.  SF'ONS0.!3ED BY.

The date is Memoria.  Day, May 25th.  ALL SANDIA HEIGHTS RESIDENTS ARE INVITED.  Come to the park for coffee and donuts at 10  a.rn.  Meet your neigh- bors,  see  our  park  improvements,  get  information  on our new jogging  trails, and cheer our triathalon participants.  The triathalan events will start at 10:30 at the park:  running four  laps around the park, biking one to three laps around the bike coursell  (depending on  age>, and then swimming laps at the Four Seasons Club Pool.  We will have helium  balloons  to  decorate  the  bikes,  ribbons  for all  participants, and a free barbeque chicken lunch at the pool.  In order  to help  assure a  safe bike course for all riders, we will  restrict automobile traffic from the  bike  course  for  the  rather brief  period that it will be in use:  starting at 10:40 for approximately 30 to  ·40 minutes.  Barricades will be placed at  the locations  indicated on the  diagram and  will each  be personed  by an  adult who will help direct the  bikers.  If you must drive near the park or  near the  biker route, please  use extreme caution.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.  Remember, the chicken lunch is free for all Sandia Heights residents,  not just triathalon  participants.  We'll  have  plenty  of  food, soft  drinks, beer,  soft ice  cream (back  by popular  demand>, and we'll begin  serving at 12 Noon.  The SHHA Board of Directors is planning  a  fun  day  for everyone.  PLEASE COME!''  SEE YOU THERE!!!  ;-(  $S  J c  ~  r- s  LE:<=.E.~D: - (j) -ST'ICEE.T l:)LocKED  +- -<c- ~ E •~E- .

One of  the most  progressive goals  of this year, and at times seem- ingly impossible, was the effort to  begin establishing  Long Range Goals.  Enter  Rod  Stewart  with  his  innate  ability  to  motivate, educate and  obligate.  Rod has prepared the first draft of these Goals with  which the  Board is  now wrestling.  This  committment to  Long Range  Planning is a  prerequisite to a successful  Association and  the future  for our  way of  life  in  Sandia  Heights.  He  has even agreed to remain in contact and  assist next year's Board with the all-important task  of implementation of  this Plan.  We will  discuss this further at the Annual Meeting to be held  May 30th at 10:00 a.m. at the new Fire Station on Paseo del Norte.  I hope it's rather obvious that  this  year  has  been  one  of great  accomplishment and  purpose.  But there's always much more to be done.  I  think it's important to realize how  hard all  of your  Board members have  been working  on your  behalf.  Next year should be another banner year in  Sandia Heights, but we need your  continued help  and support.  It's time  to  close this epistle,  and  parsonally, I'm going to enjoy the ensuing  year as these great people "do their th;iQg" to better Sandia Heights.  My  sincere  thanks  to  everyone  on  the  Board,  Cleve Matthews of the Tram  Company, and even tho0gh this is  my last  hurrah, Sandia  Heights is just  beginning to cheer!  Don't forget  to attend the Annual Meeting (Saturday, May. 30> and the  Spring Fling· (Monday, May 25). ·  John .

The  unseasonably  warm  weather  that  we've been having has made me  feel guilty about the jogging that  I  haven't  been  doing  somehow it  seems that  the guilt  should be  erased by  reflecting on  all the skiing  that I  didn't do  during the  best ski  season we've  had in  years.  Ah 1  Spring! - time to wake up and get this project on the read!  First, thanks  to all  of you  who took  the time to contact me about  the park or volunteer to help on the jogging trails.  If you  called while  I was  out of  town, your call didn't go unnoticed.  If you haven't ~ailed  but think that now you may have the time to  help on  this project, please  let me know.  Weather permitting,  we plan  to have  our first  work day on Sunday,  April 26 at 1:00 p.m.  If you  can  spare  a  couple  of  hours  that day,  please call  em.  I need  people who  have experience  operating a can of  spray paint to mark off the  increments on  the trails.  We  will also be  cutting and  routing out the numbers on the trail markers, so skill with a  router will  help me.  At  the next  workday we  will set  the markers in  concrete,  hopefully  completing  the first  of four planned loops in the  area.  After I  have enough  volunteers familiar  with the  plan that the  SHHA Board has approved, further worker on the system can be made whenever  a volunteer has time, rather than at formal work days.  If you haven't been out to see our park and  the new  equipment, stop  by some  warm afternoon.  Let  me know what you think we could do to make  the park fit your needs.  Don't  forget  that  for  large  groups  such as  family reunions,  company picnics  and spor·ts te<::i.m pt--o:i.ctice·:s you must  ma.k~  reservation~ to preclude a conflict at the park.  Have a great summer and we'll see you at the Spring Fling.

Ready access is defined as  being  a  cleared  area  to  a  radius of  3-feet from the center point of the hydrant and to be clear for a distance  of 18-inches from the hydrant base to the bottom of the large center cap.

We would  like to test these products on rock squirrels and their fleas in hopes of  providing long term rodent and/or flea control, thus reducing th~ risk of  plague to residents of areas such as Sandia Heights.  Rock squirrels and  their fleas have been responsible for a majority of the human plague  cases in New Mexico and also have accounted for over 60% of the plague  infected specimens collected in Bernalillo County.  Plague  infected  rodents have been found in Sandia Heights three of the last six years.  Briefly,  the rodenticide  is chol eca lcifero l  (vitamin  ~) and  the  insecticide is permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid.  Both products can be  obtained by the homeowner for use around the home but are not currently  registered for use against wild rodents or fleas.  The insecticide has  demonstrated flea control  in  the  lab for eight months  after one  application.  The material we use now, carbaryl, provides flea control  for 2-3 weeks.  We have tested the rodenticide against rock squirrels and  it has shown excellent results.  Both products are relatively safe in  terms of toxicity to non-targets, such as dogs, cats, and birds.  In order to test these products we need the cooperation of you, the  residents of Sandia Heights.  If you have numerous rock squirrels (large  grey to brown squirrels that prefer the rocky areas) on your property or  you and your neighbors have rock squirrel problems we would like to  conduct tests.  We do not want to eliminate the rock squirrel population  on everyone's property.  We need to test three to four different methods  of  applying  the  insecticide to  live squirrels  and  will  use  the  rodenticide only in instances where homeowners wish that this be done.  The ultimate goal of this study is to provide to individuals living in  plague endemic areas tools which they may use to reduce their risk of  contracting plague around the home.  This applies not only here but in  '  the rest of the western United States.  We would like to start the study in early May.  It would involve one  pesticide application and visits to your property 2-3 days a month to  conduct live trapping and the counting of rodents and their fleas.  If  you would like to help by 'partiC-ipating in any aspect of this study  - , •  please contact Curt Montman at 768-2600 for further details.  * * * * *  BABY SITTER  Mal i<::-1 List  l 4 ye,;H-s old  Experienced Baby Sitter  :;?94-369 l.  * * * * *  LOCAL BABY SITTING  F«:..q e Moore  15 ye,;u-·s old  Experience with infants  275-0804  * * * * *  NEED A DOG WALKED?

Same time ago the ordinance was  declared unconstitutional and the signs were ordered removed.
