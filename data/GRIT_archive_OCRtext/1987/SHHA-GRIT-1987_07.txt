COMING OF AGE IN SANDIA HEIGHTS  Sandia Heights became part of my life in 1969.  I remember well petitioning for mail service and the sixteen original  neighbors driving 25 miles for one another's groceries. It is well we had  no real fires for we were the volunteer brigade. On Sundays, we took  turns fetching and delivering the paper to the literate. Most of us are  still here and still literate. We call ourselves pioneers.  "You live out THERE? Is it paved?" Well of course it's paved, we would  say, knowing it was only a couple of months ago. Fiercely proud we  were. We still are.  SH has come from neighbors pooling resources to a full, hard working  board of directors with responsibilities increasing at a frightening pace.  Taking over from John Freeman this month, I realize what an important  job John has done leading the transition that Rab Freeman (no relation)  started before him. Some 3000 of us owe them both a great deal.  SH has had to grow from swapping paper routes to building and main- taining a park, mapping and marking jogging trails, a spring party for  more than 300 people, many get togethers, Fourth of July safety patrols  and lobbying at the County Commission. We handle an average of 100  covenant problems EVERY MONTH. Happily, 70% achieve compliance  within 90 days. Some 30% go into the problems file and require hours of  mediating and cajoling.  The Covenant Control Committee works with problems that arise after a  home is constructed--added back boards or coolers, that kind of thing.  The Architectural Control Committee starts earlier, when plans sets are  submitted for approval. ACC forestalls problems before they start. Hours  a week, every week, are spent reviewing plans, visiting building sites,  talking to home builders, architects and prospective neighbors.  Soon these activities will seem quaint and bring fond smiles the same  way the 1969 grocery routes do now. In 1987, we're on the cusp of the  inevitable transition to SHHA taking over the administration of a small  city. Elsewhere in this Grit (started by one of the pioneers, Shelley  Goldbloom) you can read our goals for 1987-88. They include the design  and adoption of a long range plan to get us through the transition with  minimal scathing.  Your elected board members and the volunteers who assist them are  doing all they can to plan well so that when Sandia Heights grows to  full adulthood, we can still be pleased and proud to live here.

Fireworks are  best enjoyed  when witnessing a controlled display put  on by professionals in a location well clear  of homes.  Handled  in any  other fashion  they become the dangerous, senseless items they really are.  One tragic incident has already occurred and we  certainly can  do without  a repetition on July 4.  The  whizz-bangs,  bottle rockets,  cherry  bombs  and such-like are  banned by  a County  ordinance and  their use  in this area is forbidden.  The  penalty for  such illicit use is a fine of Sl,500 and/or a prison  term.  Even sparklers should  not  be ·discarded  in  a  haphazard fashion  since the latent heat can easily set off a brush fire on your property.  District 5  will maintain a Fire-Watch throughout July 4.  We hope we  will not be busy.  Members  of  the  Board  of  Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association  are  once  again  cooperating  with  your Fire Department and  maintaining a Fire-Watch in  various areas  of  Sandia Heights  for your  safety and well being.  Please, please  do your part. Do without any fireworks and let us all  enjoy a sane and fire-free July 4.

So  far we  have managed to  avoid a  conflict on  the busy holidays and weekends.  Generally is it not  necessary to reserve the park for individual use as the current facilities  have so  far proven  adequate.  The park is open every day from dawn till  d0sk, and is open to use by all Sandia Heights residents.  Work on the  Jogging  and  cycling trails is  moving  along nicely.  Sandia Heights residents Gene  Roseth, Ed  Whitten, Ellen  Cox, and Bobby  Arbuckle have given their time and talents to help completely  roughly 1/3  of the trails plan.  Your board  members Jim Randall,· Ralph Tate and Mike  Cox have donated time and  weekends  working  on  this project.  If you  encounter any  of these people, please let them know that you a~preciate  the effort that they have given.  Enclosed in this issue of THE GRIT  you  should  find  a  map  of the  trails plan.  I  know it  may be confusing to read at first, b0t remember  that the completed trails have mileage markers inside their symbols.  All  trails start at the park, and by summer's end we will have a trail legend  erected at the park.  To use the trails, simply  pick up  a trail nearest  to your  home, and  note the  mileage that you jog or cycle by the markers  on the roadside.  It may be necessary  to estimate the mileage  from your  t1ome to the nearest  m·arker, but  I haven't  figured out  a way to make a  trail start at everyone's doorstep yet.  The markers are  a one  foot tall  4x4 redwood post, color coded and placed about 2 feet off the road.  I still  need volunteers to finish the project by summer's end, so if  you can spare a couple of hours on a weekend or evening, please call me.  Le't have_ a great sum~er and a safe 4th of July!

This service is provided 106 hours per  week and is a coordinated service with the Bernalillo County Sheriff's and Fire  Departments. The ~ecurity Patrol has constant direct communication with the Sheriff's  office and Fire Department. The Patrol Service provides assistance to the Sheriff's  and Fire Departments, reports fire and assists in any fire and rescue situations and  provides additional patrols to residences upon request during the absence of the  homeowner.  The Patrol responds to an average of 110 calls per month. These calls range from house  alarms, lost pets, lost children, suspicious looking vehicles and/or persons, in-house  reptiles and rodents, illegal fireworks, disturbances, speeding vehicles and/or motorcycles,  dead animals, loose or barking dogs and assistance with vehicle failures.  The Security Patrol maintains a high visibility by patrolling approximately four (4) to  five (5) thousand miles each month within the Sandia Heights Communities. This high  visibility provides a strong deterrent to crime.  Without question, the Security Patrol Service enhances values within Sandia Heights  area and is an amenity of the highest quality service which has been commended by  the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department as well as the City of Albuquerque Police  Department.  Over the past two years, dramatic improvements in equipment, personnel and response  time have been made. During that period of time, the patrol time has been increased  by 25 percent, from 85 hours to 106 hours. During this time we have not raised the  rate for service, however we now find it necessary to raise the rate by 50 cents per  month effective July 1, 1987. We have managed to keep the rate increase below three  (3) percent for each year.  The Sandia Heights Services . Department strives to continue to provide high quality,  professional service.
