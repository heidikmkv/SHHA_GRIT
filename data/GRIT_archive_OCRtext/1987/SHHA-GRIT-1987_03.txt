A famous  disappointed."  year,  but  is  Sandia Heights.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  philosopher once  said:  "He who  expects nothing is never  Your Homeowners Board not  only expects  great things this  working  towards  accomplishments of significant impact on  On a tangible level, we have erected the Sandia Heights illuminated  bulletin  board  between the Circle K and the Outpost Arena.  This board  announces upcoming  Homeowner events  and other  pertinent happenings here  in  Sandia  Heights.  We  have  also just completed the acquisition and  installation of  concrete tables,  ben~hes and  a trash receptacle at the  Park.  The jogging  path idea  has already completed the drawing board stage  and is now ready for implementation.  We  will need  some volunteer assis- tance and will be calling those of you ~ho have already expresied interest  in this project.  If you would like to assist and have not been contacted,  please call Mike Cox or Roger Hoppe.  Less tangible,  but  of  paramount  importance,  is the  long range  planning on which your Board is placing so much emphasis.  In  the not too  distant fLiture,  the Homeowners  Association is going to have to be ready,  wi 11 i'ng ,- and financial 1 y ab 1 e  to take over  many  of  the services now  performed  by  the Sandia  Peak  Tram  Company.  Such an undertaking is  difficult to anticipate and plan for, as it has  not  been  an  issue in  prior yeari.  · Your Board has already been working on a mission statement,  goals and objectives, strategic ~lanning and  a  five-year  plan  for the  Sandia Height~ Homeowners Association.  The commitment to this long range  planning is SFLtcia1 so that we  are acting  out our  goals and objectives  rather  1th~~ reacting to each situation as it confronts us.  We are  looki~g out~ide of Sandia Heights for  information  from  other homeowner  groups and  associations to see how others have initiated their groups or  how they have effectuated the type of transition that we  are now facing.  Inherent in the success of this venture is obviously proper planning,  but equally as important is the willingness to  adapt to the new demands  and opportuniti~s that this situation presents.  Our  intent is to have  the entire.long.range planning package ready to  present and  implement at  the A~nuai. Me~~ing.  Even though.ou~ goals and expectations are lofty, we  don't expect to be disappointed.

Well~ we do, and we even have a park to show  for it.  A  lot of  people don't  know where  it"s located,  so here's  some hot info.  Our park is just south of Tramway Road and west of Juniper Hill.  We have  a  nice softball  park  with  backstop,  a playground for young children,  basketball goals,  and the  Homeowners Association  has recently purchased  park benches,  picnic tables,  and a  trash receptacle.  There is a water  fountain but no restroom facilities <we're working on that>.  It's a nice  place to  come for  a picnic  with the  family or  to watch  the kids play  soccer, and it can be made available for large groups,  such as  a company  picnic,  by  calling  me  for  a  reservation.  This type of use is on a  first-called-first-reserved basis, so please plan ahead.  We're also planning the  long-awaited jogging trail system  and hope  to start serious work  in the spring.  The latest plan is for a series of  interconnecting loops throughout  Sandia  Heights,  the  surrounding Elena  Gallegos Grant  Open Space  area, La  Cueva, and  Forest Service land.  We  will publish a trails map in the Sandia Heights directory, and will have a  master trails  legend  at  the  park.  Trails will be marked at 1/2 mile  increments, so that joggers, walkers, and bicyclists will be able to pick  up the trails at  any point  and know the distance that they travel.  The  plan is to develop a  multi-use  system  to  benefit all  types  of human  powered  travel  that  will  eventually interface with the continuation of  the system  that the city and  county plan  when they  widen Tramway from  Montgomery.  We do  t-1ave a  number of  ideas on  further improvement  of the par~"  including possibly  purchasing a  Par Course.  <A Par  Course is  a set  ·  -- -. --~permaffent--ei<erci ·s~oevrces---aesi-gnea---t:c:r pravfele- a  b-d:l~nced-- -ema·rci se  routine outdoors.>  The  cost of  the syste~ depends on  what version and  how  many  stations  ~e buy,  so it's a decision that we would like your  imput on.  When we do start building the jogging system, I'll need  all of those  of you  who volunteered  in the  questionnaire that  we put  out last year  <don't worry, I haven't lost the list).  I'd also  welcome any  input on  the current• proposals or  anything in  general regarding  the park.  Feel  free to call <or write if you want  to be  indignant or  remain anonymous>  anytime.  Remember that the park system is yours to enjoy!

Thanks to the Bernalillo  County Fire  Department, District 5 - your  Volunteer Fire Department for  their  emergency  assistance!  We learned  firsthand about  the value of District 5 Volunteer Fire Department service  when a medical emergency occurred late one night at our home during  a bad  snow storm  and icy road conditions in January, 1987. Their assistance was  furnished within a few minutes by very considerate and qualified personnel  and without  charge.  We applaud  these individuals  who work free during  all hours for our protection.  They also need your  help through contribu- tions to  make their  work environment even more successful ih the future.
