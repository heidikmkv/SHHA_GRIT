COVENANT CONTROL COMMITTEE REPORT - 8/12/87  The Covenant  Control Committee  spends most  of its time helping the  Sandia Heights Homeowners maintain the quality of life in our  area.  With  over  1200  homeowners  in  the area,  and  with many different covenants  applying to each  different  unit,  it is  a  significant  undertaking to  maintain the  Sandia Heights  quality of  life we like so much in our part  of the greater metropolitan area of Albuquerque.  Most of you respond  positively to  the requests  to comply  with the  covenants sent  to you  by Cleve  Matthews of the Sandia Peak Tram Company  on behalf of the  Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association.  In  fact. over  90% of  the violations are resolved  in this manner and with this kind of  suppbrt.  I thank you for  your  help  and  consideration,  and  with· this  support, we  should be  able to settle the  other 10%  of the violations.  However, it doesn't seen to work out that way.  I and several other members of  the  Board  have  made  telephone and  personal  calls plus  have  investigated  to aid in trying to resolve the  violations.  Additional letters are transmitted  and cooperation usually  is obtained  in  another  5  to  81. of the cases.  However, the remaining  cases are not resolved because  the  homeowner  chooses to disregard the  cov~nants, thereby reducing the quality of life for his neighbor, reducing  the quality of life in  general,  and  indicating  to his neighbors and  community that citizenship is unimportant.  Sandia Heights  Homeowners  let's ncit  permit this kind of  degradation in our neighborhood.  I am a volunteer who needs your help.  During the month of July, the Covenant Cammi ttee sent o.ut  over fifty  letters asking  to have  our neighbors  comply with the covehants.  Common  ~iolations are RV's and  boats parked  in yard~ flues, air conditioners,  appendages from  the hou~e not painted in concert with the remaining part  of the house1 and  basketball boards  not painted  in accordance  with the  house area.  In  other cases,  people have  called ta resolve barking dog  problems, lights from shopping centers shininq  in  houses,  and swimming  pools  not  being  enclosed.  Most  of  these  again are being salved by  positive~  happy  neighbors  dedicated  to  improving  the  Sandia Heights  quality of life.  Thank you.  Roger K.

The B6ard  was advised  of the county's intention,  as part of their  on-going maintenance, to do  extensive clearing  of all  road shoulders in  Sandia Heights.  Sandia Heights North would be the first area cleared.  This program  has been  initiated because  many chamisa and trees are  encroaching on the shoulders of the r-oad which  makes up  the area defined  as the  county "right  of i-Jay."  To  a lesser  degr-ee, other obstructions  have also been identified that have cr-eated poor- visibility and/or safety  hazards.  These liability situations on county "right of way" can no longer be  ignored by.the county and have already resulted  in threats  of litigation  in similar situations and areas.  Although  the  county  "right  of  way"  varies throughout the Sandia  Heights Subdivision, each property owner can assume that at least  10 feet  from  the  road  edge is subject  to county jurisdiction and as such, a  mandatory shoulder clearing program is at the county's discretion.  Since the  July  8,  1987  meeting,  concerning  the  county shoulder  clearing  program,  members  of  your  Homeowner's  Association  have been  working with representatives of the county to more  adequately define this  program.  A survey of all roads in Sandia Heights North has been conducted  and major .problem areas  have been  identified by  specific address where  possible •  . The cbunty  rep~esentatives, in  an effort to preserve the aesthetics  . of the area have tentatively agreed  to cl ear  appro:-: i ma tel y ·four  feet of  the county  "right of way" on both sides of the road in most areas in lieu  of the entire "right of way."  Special  emphasis will  be placed  on that  vegetation, including chamisa, trees or tree overhang, which presents view  obstructions or shoulder safety hazards to the "right of way."  In a nutshell, if  you  are  approaching  ¥Our  property  from either  direction;  vegetation  and/or  view  obstructions within ~Ll~ of the  edge of the road  will definitely  be subject  to the  county clear-ing and  trim-back program~  The county  maintenance ~epresentatives have, in a spirit of coopera- tion with  the Homeowner•s  Association also  agreed,. that  sLtb_iect to the  county's general  cle~ring philosophy;  that each owner could optionally  cut back th~ir own vegetation• tr~es, chamisa, etc.  There  should be many  owners who  would prefer  an opportunity to meet the county requirements,  and in so doing,  influence the  degree of  "cutback" of  their respective  properties.  The ~aunty would understandably still reserve  the right to approve  or requir-e additional cut  back of  the "right  of i'1ay"  on a case-by-case  basis after making this concession to the homeowner.  In support  o-t those  owner·:; who desire to do their own clearing, the  county has agreed to pr-ovide clean-up  support  during  the  per-iod  of 14  September through 18 September 1987.  In  this  r-egar-d  they  have  requested  that you please assemble all  large branches, limbs and chamisa in accessible piles  on the  shoulder of  the road,  pr-eferably not  later- than  14 September  1987.  Please do not  obstru~t the roadway.  It is also requested that you place small materials  in  plastic  bags  or. boxes to facilitate pickup and easier handling, as  well as a complete cleanup.  If you do not  wish to participate in  the owner  clean-up program,  the county  will implement  their- o~n  cutb~c:k program at their discr~tion  in the near future •  .... continued on Page  Sandia Heights South Owners should be prepared for the implementation  of this program at a later date.  All property  owners should  give careful consideration to the county  "right of way" requirements.  New  plantings on  or in  the "right  of way  area," which  upon maturing  will restrict  shoulder or road visibility or  present safety hazards, will be subject to cutback  or elimination at all  times.  The minimum  "right of  way" is at least  10 feet  from the road  edge.  All new mail boKes should be set back as far as practical.  If the  mail bm:  is in  the "right of w.:i.y" it should not obstruct the shoulder or  road as to visibility.  Large rock formations should not  be formulated in  new construction  areas on the "right of way."  Here again, the county can  make a removal at their discretion if a "hazard" e:dsts.  The Sahdia Heights Homeowner~s Board wants  to thank  you in advance  for your  cooperation and  understanding in  supporting this  program.  We  feel that the county, in view of the liability considerations  and ability  to legally control their "right of way," is attempting to meet their road  maintenance and safety responsibilities in a  practical manner.  They are  willing tti cooperate in preserving as much vegetation as is possible. and  will work with individual owners to define requirements.  ·  If you should require additioMal specific:  information regarding this  program please call Leonard  DeLue, Homeowher's  Association Board Member  assigned to this project.  Phone 294-4451.  POTENTIAL PROBLEM?  Due to the increased  sightings  of  coyotes  in  the Sandia Heights  area, I  have been  asked by the Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association to  do an informal study  on the situation.  Please contact  me if  you have  sighted any  coyotes lately or have  lost any  pets tb  them.  Remember - these are wild ani~als - db not feed them!  Your cooper~tion is appreci- ated.  Please call John Gabaldon at 293-9300 <work> or 275-2636 <home>.  -------------------------------------------------~----------------------- SHHA BOARD ELECTIONS  Due  to  the resignations of  Dennis  Burt and Jack Wirtz, the SHHA  board will elect two new members at the September board  meeting.  are  interested  in  being  on  the  board, please call any of the  board members.  One position is a term till 1988; the other  1989.  remember that this is a WORKING BOARD - be prepared!

The low-down on Sandia Heights!  Well~ not this time around.  The Chief and Members of B.C.F.D.  District 5  Volunteer Fire Depart- ment wish  to convey  their most  sincere thanks to MF.  Ed Bates and his  group of residents who  gave of  their time to serve as Fire-Watchers on  the evening of July 4th.  The help was much appreciated.  A recent  request  to  the  County  Planning Commission by Quail Run  Enterprises for  a zoning  change to  permit construction  of a restaurant  with  a  full  liquor  license  was  denied.  It has been learned that the  applicants will not appeal  this decision.  Although  I received numerous  calls stating  the callers• strong opposition to the application, only two  other residents of Sandia Heights were sufficiently concerned to put  in a  personal appearance at the hearing and voice their displeasure.  Petitions and  suchlike do  have some  impact but  to be vocal before· any of these ComMissions has far  more effect.  State  your objections in  person.  Believe me, it carries weight.  Southwestern Asset  Management requested  a Special  Use Permit for a  • planned development on the northwest corner of Quai 1  Run and  San Rafael,  8 units  on 1.34 acres.  The Sandia Heights Architectural Review Com~ittee  approved the project ih toto since it fully  complied with  all aspects of  established guidelines.  At  the hearing, for some inexplicable reason,  without  discussion,  the  Environm~ntal Planning  Commission  denied the  ap_plication, primarily  based on  al""!_.E_bJ~s_tion by Commissioner John Padillo  on the somewhat odd reasoning that. 6 Ltni ti;\ woLtl d better suit the "reqLti re- ments of  Open Space and our qual i t'y,'o'f'-fife.

If you've  been to the park  recently, you  may have noticed two new  picnic tables that the Homeowners Association  has purchased  to help with  larger groups  that the park is seeing during summer months.  We've placed  them lower, next to the playground, so that parents can be close to small  children using  the playground  equipment.  Now, if you're wondering what  parent would ever let their child play on that stuff  that we  have at the  park, I"d  concur with  your judgement.  So I'm in the process of updating  and repairing the existing equipment.  I"m also talking with  a playground  equipment distributor,  and hope to add a slide to the existing swings and  teeter-tot ti::r·s.  Cleve Matthews has promised to have the drinking fountain repaired  <I"d bet that it's fixed before  the  Alvarado-Tram  Company  picnic).  I  would like to know  who used  the park  dn the  4th of July, because they  started a fire in the plastic  trash  liner,  and  burned  snakes  on the  benches behind  the backstop.  If you have any idea, let me know and we"ll  form a vigilante group to extract payment for defacing our park.  HA!  The trails system is all but complete.  The markers are all  in place  with  the  exception  of  two  in the City of Albuquerque's Elena Gallegos  park.  Currently sensitive negotiations are  underway  to establish a  treaty with  this entity,  so let's hope that  they are  reasohable.  The  Legend for the park is the last task to complete,  and I  look for comple- tion by October of nineteen eighty something.  My sincere  thanks to all who helped in the Trails effort~ including  Ed Whitten,  Jim Randall,  and Rciger  Hoppe, who  came ori  the most recent  work  day  and  negotiated  right-of~way with the Forest Service and that  other entity.  There is one  person, however,  who I  cannot thank enough,  and that  is Ken  Comer.  Ken called me out of the clear blue one day when  I was desperate for help.  Ken has  marked, measured  and literally blazed  trails for  Sandia  H~ights.  He  helped  m~ backpack concrete into the  national forest f9r marker~, and without his help our system  could not be  nearly as complete.  Most important  to me,  however, is if I've gotten  nothing else out of this project, I now have Ken as a friend.  Ken has written a  T~~ils Guide  for this  issue of  THE GRIT,  and I  hope that  I can  convince him  to w~ite about his experiences in Sandia  Heights for future issues.

If your pick-up falls on this  date, your refuse will be collected on Tuesday, September 8, 1987.  Trash is to be placed out on the day of the scheduled pick-up and any containers  retrieved the same day. Placing trash out prior to the date of pick-up invariably  results in it being spread throughout the Community with the help of wind and loose  dogs and ca ts.  If you need a special pick-up, please call Leah at 296-9585. The charge for a special  pick-up is only $7 .50 and can be scheduled for a Wednesday or a Friday.  COVEN ANT CONTROL  There are still boats, trailers and R.V.'s parked on lots in violation of the Covenants.  Your cooperation in removing or screening such vehicles will be greatly appreciated.  Of late there has been an increase in building, remodeling, additions and fence  installation without prior approval of the Sandia Heights Architectural Control  Committee.  There are still air conditioner and propane tank screens which are in need of repair  or replacement.  ANIMAL CONTROL  This month we had another incident where a dog attacked a young lady on the street.  You are reminded that County Ordinance 83-37 prohibits dogs and cats running at  large. Your cooperation and support in keeping your animals controlled will be greatly  appreciated by all residents in the Community. County Animal Patrol is patrolling  the Communities on a weekly basis.
