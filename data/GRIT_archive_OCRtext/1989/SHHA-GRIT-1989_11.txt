Recycling Options and Survey  The Board of Directors of the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association has  had several discussions on the subject of  recycling waste items. In July, the Board  heard from Mr. Gene Crabtree, the  Executive Director of Recycle New  Mexico and Mr. Bill Terry, General  Manager  of Waste  Management  Company. From these gentlemen it was  learned that there are several options  available to the local homeowners on the  subject of recycling waste materials. The  options range from having curbside  pickup of recycling materials to a central  depository for segregated waste.  The  costs associated ·with recycling vary  widely, also. Each homeowner likely  would be charged for periodic curbside  pickup, while the central depository idea  might generate modest amounts for a  neighborhood group or for the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association as a  whole.  At the August meeting, the Board  decided to prepare an article for the  GRIT and to conduct a survey of the  homeowners. It was felt that many of the  SHHA members likely were doing their  own recycling by taking their papers to any  one of several service club boxes along  the road and their aluminum cans, glass  and plastic containers to their churches,  Boy Scouts, or favorite charity.  In our American disposable life style,  we are creating mountains of waste.  Reports say that the amount is 150  million tons per year. We know also that  much of the United States is filling up its  landfills and that some Eastern states  would like to send their waste material to  New Mexico for disposal. The Board of  Directors feels that they would prefer to  have a voluntary program as opposed to  mandatory programs that many states  have felt required to adopt. Waste from  Albuquerque and its metropolitan area  will likely be shipped to the Rio Puerco  in a two-step transportation program  startingnext year, as the landfill south of  town is nearly full. Therefore, the need  is urgent and the time to do something is  now.  The Board of Directors will be  conducting a telephone survey of the  homeowners on recycling waste  materials. If and when you are called,  please respond to the questions asked!  Bill Heflin, 291-0489  LA CUEVA  SCHOOL ZONE  SPEED  LIMIT  85  "Dlive carefu!zv, dear.

All the houses  on that quadrangle are in the 2000' s (2001  to 2036) and they've only been here about  1-1/2 years or less. The same is true on  the west side of Tramway to the south of  Tramway Court.

This is a good time  to take a fewminutes to gaze at the Sandia  Mountains and realize what a treasure  you have right at your doorstep. Few  major urban areas in the world can boast  such an attraction!  PLANNING NEW TRAIL  Construction of a new trail was begun  early in October. The trail will connect  the new Faulty extension trail above Doc  Long Picnic Ground with the Tree  Springs Trail.  TRAILHEAD PORTAL SIGNS  We have begun an ambitious series of  signing projects that will improve the in- formation system at our more heavily  used trailheads. The first to go in was at  the La Luz Train in Juan Tabo. Each  portal will boast a "YOU ARE HERE"  sign with some information about the  Sandia Mountain Wilderness. Our tail  crew has done a very professional job of  putting these packages together. I wel- come your comments about the design.

Ask for  trees at the nursery that can withstand  drought well once they are' established  and you'll be a long way ahe.ad toward a  successful garden.  Near the top of the list. of drought  resistant small trees that can be grown  successfully here is our graceful New  Mexico olive (Forestiera neomexicana)  which is slow growing to 12 feet or more.  Once established, it will survive very dry  conditions. It is deciduous with small  privet-like leaves that turn gold in the fall.  The desert willow ( chilopsis linearis) is  successful in the most  ~iscouraging  conditions. Some of them grow along I- 25 near Bernalillo in what appears to be  pure gravel with no apparent source of  water. Each spring, they put out their  pale pink blossoms in a brigh~ show. Not  willows at all, they belong to the bignonia  family, related to the catalpa whose  flowers the dessert willow's vaguely  resembles. Whenithasreallywarmed up  in late April, its willow-like leaves come  out on pendulous branches that look  somewhat like those of a weepingwillow.  In June and July, it is covered with  graceful 1-1/2 inch flowers, followed by  long "string bean" pods. Last year with  the heavy rains, my tree had some flowers  'till frost.  Research and selective  cultivation of this tree at NMSU and in  Texas have produced several lovely  cultivars, including a lavender pink  named "Barranca," the i ruby red  Page 11  THEVIEtV FROM TACKRABBIT HILL  "Regal," and the pure white "Hope" (still  scarce in the nurseries).  Though  normally a small, shrubby tree in the wild,  with additional water it can get quite  large. My three year old tree is 12 feet tall  now (with only natural rainfall after the  first year) and I have seen an example in  an old Albuquerque garden that must  have been 35 feet tall. Last year, Sunset  magazine reported a new Russian cross  of this tree with the southeastern catalpa  that sounds promising for our .area. It is  now available in the nurseries and looks  like it will be a more formal looking,  denser-leaved tree than the parent desert  willow.  · Another pretty native bloomer is the  New  Mexico  ·locust  (robinia  neomexicana). This is usually a very  spiny customer that spreads by suckers to  form dense clumps. The long sprays of  soft pink, pea-like flowers in early  summer make this small tree a likely  candidate for an informal spot in the  garden or as a barrier planting.  This year I've tried the false indigo  (amorpha fructicosa), a small tree (10 to  15 feet) that grows in loose clumps on  stream banks all overour state. Its leaves  somewhat resemble a· locust's and, in  summer, it produces tight bunches of  dark purple flowers. It appears to be  completely happy even in the drought  and turns a rich yellow in the fall.  A favorite of many people for its  wonderful deep red fall color is the  smooth sumac ( rhus glabra) that you will  see on the drive to Sandia Crest. It grows  all over our range and can be a small  shrub 3 feet or a tree 20 feet tall. It is  drought tolerant and makes a handsome  contrast to grey sages or pines. There are  several cultivars ()f this plant in the  nurseries that will probably do well here.  Others to consider are some of the new  smaller varieties of ash trees, vitexwith its  lovely blue flowers, the mountain ash,  hop tree, the smoke tree (Cotiuns  coggygria), Chinese pistache, hawthorn,  Chinese elm (not the Siberian pest), and  mountain mahogany pruned to tree  form.  -- Jean Heflin  "Just what I need.'

If you expect a tax refund  for 1989, instead of mailing your return to  IRS, you may want to have it filed  electronically.  When  you  file  electronically, you receive your refund in  about 3 weeks, or in about 2 weeks if you  have it deposited directly into your  savings or checking account.  For a  charge, many professional tax preparers  offer electronic filing in addition to their  retrurn preparation services.  If you  prepare your own retUJ;!J,,, a preparer or  transmitter in your area can file your  return electronically for you. For a list of  those in your area who can file your  return electronically for you, call IRS  toll-free at 1-800-424-1040 and ask for  the Electronic Filing Office.  Refund Checks. Be sure to cash your  refund check soon after you receive it.  Checks not cashed within 12 months of  the date of the check will be cancelled.  Deduction for Exemptions. The deduc- tion for each exemption -- for you, your  spouse, and dependents -- has increased  to $2,000. For 1989, you may not claim an  exemption for your child who was a full- time student and was age 24 or older at  the end of the year, unless the child's  gross income was less than $2,000. But  the child may claim an exemption on his  or her own retrun.  Social Security Numbers for Depend- ents Age 2 or Older. If you claim any  person age 2 or older as a dependent,  show that person's social security num- ber on your return.  Child and Dependent Care Expenses.  You may not claim the credit for child  and dependent care expenses or exclude  employer-provided dependent care  benefits from your income unless you  Colltinued on page 14  Page 14  TaxTijpS  For1989  Continued from page 13  report the new information abou~ the care provider on  Form 2441. You may not claim;a credit for payments  made for the care of a dependent child who was age 13 or  older unless the child was disabled. The age limit was 15  or older last year.  ·  Supplemental Medicare Premiu.ii. If you were eligible  for Medicare Part A benefits for more than 6 full months  during the year, you may owe the new supplemental  Medicare premium. The premium will help pay the cost  of the new Medicare catastrophi~ and prescription drug  coverage.  •  Children Under 14 May Not Hav~ To File. If your child  was under age 14 and had incom~ only from interest and  dividends that totaled less than $5;000, you may be able to  elect to report your child's incom~ on your return. If you  do, your child will not have to file a return.  Employee Business Expenses. For most people, em- ployee business expenses are dedµctible only as an item- ized deduction on Schedule A, liiie 20. If you are reim- b~rsedfor your employee expense~ under an arrangement  with your employer and both of the conditions listed below  apply, amounts you received under the arrangement  should not have been reported to you as income on your  W-2.  .  - The arrangement requires ydu to substantiate your  expenses to your employer, AND  - The arrangement requires you to return (and you do  return) any amount in excess of, your substantiated ex- penses covered under the arrangbment.  I  If the arrangement does not irieet both of the above  conditions, amounts you received 1 under the arrangement  should have been reported to you as wages on your Form  W-2.  '  LOOKING AHEAD TO 1990  Exclusion of Interest From U.S.: Savings Bonds. If you  cash Series EE savings bonds issped after 1989, you may  be able to exclude from income part or all of the interest  on those bonds. But you must haye paid higher education  expenses during the year for yop, your spouse, or your  dependent.
