.. ·~  /  Volume 89  August 1989  Number3  A M 1 1 1essage from the New President  I,  Change. If there is on~ thing we can  always count on in this woiild, it is change.  Your Sandia Heights Hobeowners As- sociation has been no exception to this  rule. As this past year has!, been clearly a  time of change for all of us in Sandia  Heights, it seems a good bpportunity to  look back on past progress and to antici- pate the planned successes in our future.  A glimpse into the past year recalls the  considerable time and energy given to  two major issues: the wa~er-rate inter- vention between your SHHA and the  Utility Company, and the negotiation of  a new service contract with' Alvarado Re- alty (ARCO).  At the present time, Sandia Heights  has grown to 1500 + homes with an ap- proximate population of 4,256. It has  been pointed out that this number is  larger than many towns across New  Mexico ... and we are expanding.  Our size alone suggests  '1 that we have  outgrown the existing organizational  structure of the Homeowriers Associa- tion. Duringthis coming ye~, your Board  will seriously consider the modification  of the current structure to\Yard embrac- ing a more truly representative model,  which will involve more people in local  neighborhoods and be more representa- tive of geographical blocks Qf constituen- cies. Such a restructuring; if accepted,  will take much of the cozµing year to  develop and implement.  ,,  Additionally, your Association will be  representing you across a variety of new  developments that makes your member- ship well worth the small in~estment you  make. Specific activities will be of inter- est to but some of you, such as early  publication of a jogging map, with mile- age markers throughout Sandia Heights;  between the Association and the City of  Albuquerque and Bernalillo County,  concerning highway expansion, road sig- nage and maintenance, security and  construction matters.  General board activity of concern to us  all during the coming year (and beyond)  will include the potential 'and' likely  agreement with sponsors of one of sev- eral proposed waste management pro- grams. If approved, such a program  would lead to source reduction of solid  waste, recycling, and possibly added  revenue from neighborhood projects  that you may wish to develop. You will be  learning more of this activity in the near  future.  A second matter of vital concern to us  all involves the Tramway and Paseo del  Norte highway construction and beautifi- cation of the Tramway portion in keeping  with similar landscaping south of  Montgomery. Assurance of timely con- struction with appropriate landscaping is  far from an agreed upon reality. The  board has begun and will continue to  aggressively piirsue our community's  interest in these issues.  Change involves people as well as new  developments. I would like to recognize  three of yourneighbors who have given of  themselves to your Association (and  thereby to you) tirelessly and unselfishly  in the past. Our outgoing President,  Leonard DeLue, gave more time and  energy to Sandia Heights interests than  perhaps any past President. He gave  much of himself during a difficult year.  Judy Harris and Rod Stewart are retiring  from the Board after six years of produc- tive involvement with the Association.  Judy's work in bringing an ever-improved  GRIT into each of our homes has been  · the planned development of a nature  accomplished with energy, imagination  preserve; and, increased political activity  and enthusiasm. Rod's input to Board  planning and decision-making often was  inspired and creative. Always, he pre- sented himself with ample wit and enthu- siasm. The richness of Sandia Heights is  found in such people, and they will be  ·missed. Change is not always kind.  However, change has provided a con- stant challenge and new strengths for the  SHHA. Your future support of the Asso- ciation, your continued goodwill, and  your neighborliness toward each other is  all we can ask. Thank you for the oppor- tunity to serve one of the finest commu- nities in our State. The best in change is  yet to come!  Ed Bates, President, SHHA  299-2155  In this issue ...

P  lease try to drive your ca'rs in Sandia  Heights somewhere nea,r the speed  limit! I notice that most of u~ are atways  in a hurry. We seem to be oblivious to  those who are walking, jogging, children  riding bicycles, or someone who just en- joys a more quiet way of life. i.1 have seen  pedestrians dive into the chamisa to pre- serve their health and well-being from  speeders. Those who do the fast driving  are of all persuasions:  yoling adults,  mothers, fathers, retired citp;ens, chil- . dren using unlawful "dirt bikes" and bus  drivers!  There. are probably others.  [Editor's Note: Don't forget 1Jhose con- stntction crews and delivery v~hicles!J  One of these days someone is going to  hurt, maim or cause something disas- trous to a child, mother, father, pet, or  what have you. And then we will need to  have a big meeting to discuss how this  kind of thing can be avoided in the future.  (This is, of course, after the headlines and  the suffering of those hurt and those who  did the hurting have been in the paper.)  Our streets will eventually get sidewalks,  the speed limit put up to45 miles per hour  (so none will get tickets), plus we will  have street lights, curbs, and the County  will widen the roads, clear the chamisa,  and have many regulations we all dislike.  Sandia Heights can remain rural if  those of us who live here want to work at  it. We need to be more conscious of what  we are doing to ourselves and be more  considerate of each other for the reasons  w_e have chosen to live here.  Please, slow down. What are we going  to say to that family after we have hurt or  destroyed a life? Sandia Heights is what  we make it, and at the moment I don't  think we are doing very well.  Thank you for printing this letter.  JOHN AND GAIL EWING  9117 Tramway Lane  From ~he Ranger's Desk  Fire Update --As you well know, this  has been a bad year for fire here. It is the  driest it's been in 15 years.·· We have  already had four man-caused fires that  blackened over 300 acres of withdrawn  lands and another 50 acres· of forest and  adjacent private land. If it had not been  for the excellent cooperation pf the mu- tual aid partners (Fire Districts 5, 6, 10, 11  and Kirtland Air Force Base), the fires  could have been worse.  These fires, the extreme fire danger,  and the lack of moisture have!. prompted  me to establish three Fire Irlformation  Stations at the main entry points of the  forest to remind all who enter that we are  in severe fire restriction. This is in addi- tion to the normal prohibition on the use  of fireworks on National Forest. Coop- eration from the forest users has been  excellent. People seem to be willing to  limit their activities in the woods when  the conditions are this dry. For this we  are all grateful.  A quick reminder: our maps are now  $2.00 each and are available at the Four  Seasons Visitor Center (top of the  Tram), Sandia Ranger District Office,  Page3  New Trail Open  Forest Service Trail 82 Tram (Tram- way) Trail has been re-routed to bypass  the North Sandia Heights private prop- erty. The new trail "head" is located at  the northeast corner of the Tram parking  lot. The Trail is restricted to walking,  jogging, and horseback riding because of  its location within the Sandia Wilderness  Area. The Tram Trail (FS Trail 82) now  connects up with the La Cueva and La  Luz Trails. A part of the old Tram Trail  remains as a "spur" to Juniper Hill Court.  The trail was built by the Forest Service  Seasonal Work Force and was completed  during April of 1989.  Special thanks to the following: U. S.  Forest Service, Mr Floyd Thompson,  Ranger, and Mr. John Hayden, Trail  Surveyor; The Tram Company, Mr.  Robert Murphy, President; and from the  SHHA, Mr. Leonard DeLue and Mr.  Roger Hoppe.  Future: In cooperation with the Forest  Service, Tram Company, and Sandia  Pueblo, we hope to have the "Misty  Trail" surveyed, with markers installed to  continue a trail south of the Tram to the  City of Albuquerque Sims Park (Open  Space) and Pinon Canyon Trail Head.  Again, this trail would be limited to hik- ing, running, and horseback riding be- cause it will be within the Sandia Wilder- ness Area.  Also in the planning phase is a trail for  bicycles, hiking, running and horseback  riding from the Tram area south to the  Sims Park. This trail would not be within  the Sandia Wilderness Area boundaries.  Attention  Boat Owners  If you have your boat here, or nearby,  and would like to have a U. S. Coast  Guard Auxiliary "Courtesy Marine Ex- amination" you can call Bill Stabler at  298-8525.

SMC is nonprofit and run entirely from dona- tions.  All Albuquerqueans, all New Mexicans, and  alllovers of the outdoors should be alarmed and  involved. Hikers, birders, runners of trails,. and  campers who love the openness of Sandia  Mountain must join. Your membership is your  vote for continuing to share the mountain with  all peoples. Your vote will be noticed in Wash- ington.  SMC is now putting out a newsletter and  offering membership categories. Membership  categories begin at one dollar for single mem- berships, five dollars for family and group  memberships. Contributors of five dollars or  more will be on the SMC mailing list . Please  send checks in any amounts, with your complete  mailing address to: Sandia Mountain Coalition,  PO Box 14353, Albuquerque, NM 87191.

In case you are a new resident of the area, the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  maintains a nice ballpark equippped with picnic tables and water that is very nice for family  or group parties. and outings. We only ask that for groups of ten or more you please call me  to reserve the park to avoid a conflict. We have a new maintenance contract with a professional  groundskeeper, and the grass looks nice despite the dry weather.  This year we have also purchased some recreational equipment that may be checked out by  homeowners to be used at your park functions. We now have a complete softball setup,  including bases, softballs, and men's, women's, an·d children's bats. Also available are two  horseshoe sets, a soccerball, and a basketball. There is no charge for usage, and the equipment  is available on a first-come basis.  If you have any out-of-use equipment such as softball mitts, bats, or what have you that you  would like to donate to the Homeowners Association, we would be happy to accept them.  I always appreciate calls and offers of help regarding our park and trails system, and I hope  that you find as much pleasure in what our area can offer as I do. Have a nice summer.  Michael Cox  293-7417  Sandia Heights  Mileage Map  On the center pages of this issue of The Grit you will find  a map of Sandia Heights showing the mileage between  various street intersections. This map should be a valuable  aid to bikers, hikers, and joggers for laying out routes,  keeping track of distance covered, etc.  The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association would  like to express its sincere appreciation to Kennith Comer,  106 Whitetail Dr, who compiled all the mileage data.

Stribling  Public Information Officer  U.S. Forest Service  TREES FOR OUR GRASSLAND  Part I - Evergreens  Sandia Heights is included in the  pinon-juniper climate belts, but edges on  the grassland. If you look at our land, the  junipers grow most often in or near the  arroyos where they get a little additional  moisture. Judging from the number of  seedlings that have shown up in my gar- den during the past few wet years, their  seeds are extremely responsive to mois- ture, but, clearly, they are able . to  withstand our long droughts.  We have severallovely junipers in New  Mexico. They are often called "cedros"  but are "sabinas", not cedars. The one- seeded juniper is common on this side of  the mountains but on the east side of the  Sandias you will see the lovely grey Rocky  Mountain variety with its pendulous  branches. Further south, the larger alli- gator juniper with large checker-like  "alligator" scaled bark is the dominant  species. Occasionally in western New  Mexico, you can find the handsome,  more tree-like Utah juniper, and a "red  berry" juniper is found in the Guadalu- pes. Putting new native junipers into a  landscape is a long-term investment  because they are so slow growing, but  they will sustain our severe droughts well  and are handsome and relatively pest  free.  The quick fix in this area seems to be  more in pinons and ponderosa pines.  Pinons do well at our altitudes if they are  given extra water while thyy get their  roots down. The ponderosas are happier  above 6500 feet where it is cooler and  normally live where the rainfall is be- tween 20 and 25 inches per year. (No  wonder you see so many dead ones where  Page 11  THE VIEW FROM TACKRABBIT HILL  they are asked to survive with the normal  city rainfall of 8 inches.) They need extra  water during our dry spells and need to be  protected from their bug pests (pine tip  moth, aphids and bark beetle). Many of  the pinons that don't make it, presuming  they have had adequate water, have had  roots badly damaged in transplanting or  had their rootballs wire wrapped so that  larger roots are girdled as the tree ma- tures, killing magnificent specimens  many years after transplanting. My pi- nons and ponderosas were moved suc- cessfully in the winter, but they also can  be moved in late summer or fall when soil  moisture levels are highest. The critical  point is that they must be watered faith- fully after transplanting and thereafter  watered consistently every winter since  evergreen foliage transpires moisture  throughouttheyear. They do well on drip  systems in well-drained soil.  The nurseries sell a lot of Colorado  spruces.  They should sell good luck  charms with them. Their natural home is  in moist, acid soils from 8 to 10,000 feet.  It takes a lot of moisture justto keep them  alive. One local bank has a particularly  sad planting of them on the west side of a  white building that is guaranteed to cook  them soon. (Sauteed spruce, not a pretty  sight!) Firs have the same requirements.  If you are planning a garden for water  conservation in our area, they don't be- long.  The Arizona cypress, which is native to  southwestern New Mexico as well as  Arizona, is commonly sold here. It is  relatively fast growing, fairly drought  tolerant, and grows up to 40 feet tall  (quickly overwhelming a small garden).  Its soft grey green color looks at home in  many of our landscapes.  Nurseries have many pines available:  Scotch pines, black pines, etc. Few have  low water requirements. One exception  is the tall Afghan pine, which has been  tried in New Mexico with limited success.  It produces tender new growth at rela- tively low temperatures.  In the Al- buquerque area, the broad swings in  temperature deep freeze new growth  repeatedly, weakening and often killing  trees.  Austrian pines are quite well  adapted here and are a good substitute  for ponderosas, but are also susceptible  to pine tip moth. The list of evergreens  that love our arid climate is not very long  but they are hardy, lovely trees.  --Jean Heflin  'Yeah, bllf it's just temporGTy."
