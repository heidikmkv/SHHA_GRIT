In many of the  situations, members have been requesting multiple documents and/or doc- uments that require a witness or witnesses. Providing these notary services  has sometimes made it challenging for our administrative staff to perform  their office duties in a timely manner, as some of the documents that need  notarization take more time to process.  Starting in August, notary service will be available on Tuesday, Wednes- day, and Thursday by appointment only. If you need notary service, please  call the SHHA office to schedule an appointment. This will allow our staff  to plan for the necessary time to perform the notary service you need and  will also help the requester to plan for witnesses, if needed.  For simple notary requests, we expect that scheduling will be prompt  and requesters will experience little delay. As always, notary service is free  to SHHA members.    Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour   Schedules New Preview Night  By Linda Burch, Sandia Heights Artists    The 19th Annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour will feature a festive Pre- view Night two evenings before the tour to showcase new works and meet  and greet artists. Residents are invited to Preview Night on Thursday, Sep- tember 15 from 5–7 PM at the Tramway Plaza Event Center, 9600 Tennyson  NE. RSVP required, see info below.  Each of our 36 artists will be present to show three of their newest arts  and crafts creations in a gallery setting. Tramway Plaza is a large, spacious  building (formerly Futures for Children) which has been completely remod- eled. Displays will be set up to give guests a first chance at purchase.      Linda Burch with some of the SHA artists’ works  Continued on page 2…  …continued from front page  2   The GRIT – August 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 8  In addition, during the Preview Night’s events, guests  can pick up a show guide and map and visit with the art- ists before the tour, which is September 17–18, 10–5 PM  each day.  Excitement has been building for this year’s tour. A  record number of resident artists have joined Sandia  Heights Artists (SHA) and the increase in types of artis- tic works has also burgeoned. In 2022, SHA will feature  painters of all genres, jewelers, fiber artists, glass art- ists, woodworkers, plus metal sculpture, ceramics, pho- tography, gourds, baskets, handmade books, and even  fine musical instruments. Most of the tour stops will of- fer outdoor as well as indoor displays.  Every year, SHA selects a local charity to support dur- ing the tour. This year, the group voted to support La  Mesa Academy, an after-school arts program for both  visual and performing arts, located in the International  District of Albuquerque. During the past two years, SHA  with your generous help has donated $4,177.35 to the La  Mesa program.  All artists hope to see you at Preview Night and dur- ing the Tour weekend.  To RSVP for Preview Night: Go to https://san- diaheightsartists.com/events and fill in the required  RSVP form. Space is limited and your RSVP will provide  us an estimated number of guests. Your consideration  is greatly appreciated.

And if you get  the paper bill in the mail, you may have overlooked the  little flyer about this, as I did until just today.  Is our water safe? Do we need to take special precau- tions? Where does our water come from? Just how hard  is our water? And how alkaline is it? How much lead has  been detected in our water? What about chlorine, fluo- ride, and nitrates?  Find the answers to all these questions and more at  2021 Water Quality Report-5.pub (sandiaheightsser- vices.com). Just reading the pamphlet made me thirsty,  and as I drank a glass of clear, cold water I was so thank- ful for the gift of abundant, clean water.     Fire Hydrant Blue Marker Stakes  By Stan Davis, SH resident  Reflective blue markers are commonly used by munici- palities to assist first responders in locating fire hy- drants quickly, especially in the dark. Often these are  small, raised markers located right on the road surface  itself. However, in Sandia Heights these markers are on  4-foot stakes, usually embedded in the ground to the  side of the road closest to the hydrant. The blue reflec- tors are located at the top oriented in such a way as to  catch and reflect light from headlights. Earlier in the  spring, the marker at the hydrant closest to my house  was accidently mowed down. I called Bernalillo County  at 505-848-1500 and asked for Road Maintenance, and  they put in a new stake within a couple days. You might  like to locate the hydrant closest to your house and, if  its blue marker is missing or damaged, call BernCo and  ask for them to replace it.       Example of a blue reflector stake marking the location of a fire hydrant  3   The GRIT – August 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 8  Continued on page 7…  Architectural Observations 2,  Blinded By the Light  By Eric Haskins, Architect & SH resident    With a boulder on my shoulder  Feelin’ kinda older  I tripped the merry-go-round  With this very unpleasin’  Sneezin’ and wheezin’  The calliope crashed to the ground    But she was  Blinded by the light  Revved up like a deuce  Another runner in the night    Manfred Mann, “Blinded by the Light”    Ah, light, the gift that separates man from the animals.  Mr. Edison’s invention remains magical, 144 years after  its introduction. We’ve come so far, but the basics re- main the same. An electric current is passed through a  substance that resists its passage, and the substance  glows. 144 years of improvement, variation, and tinker- ing have created so many options. We’ve gone from in- candescent, to fluorescent, to metal halide, to sodium,  to halogen, to LED. In most cities, a runner in the night  can see them all within the span of a few blocks. The  other evening, in my car (I don’t run at night), returning  home from W.L. Jackson Park, I passed multicolored  flood lights, 60s spherical globe lights, “security lights”  that shine in your eyes every time the wind blows, dim  little solar path lights with crackle glass finish, and even  LED faux candlelight, with flame-shaped bulbs and pro- grammed flicker. Some shone yellow like fire, some  were cold and silver like a gas station canopy. It was a  din of lumens, a glowing riot of options.  It seems like we’ve reached the point in our collective  development where we can do almost anything with  light. Which begs the obvious question: now that we  can do anything, what should we do?  To propose an answer to this question, and not have  it be a purely selfish answer, I must attempt to project  what the majority of residents of Sandia Heights want  and value. I believe most of us who live here do so in- tentionally; we chose to be here. And “here” is a neigh- borhood without street lights. We could have lived near  San Mateo and Montgomery, or 4th and Griegos, or any  number of very well-lit neighborhoods in Albuquerque.  With all the available options throughout town, all very  well-lit, we chose this place, with its total lack of public  lighting (excepting a couple of parking lots). This fact  alone suggests that perhaps—just perhaps—we appre- ciate the lack of area lighting.  Why does Sandia Heights lack street lights? Was it a  callously capitalist attempt to reduce development  costs, thus making more money for those who sold lots  here? Perhaps that was a result, but I believe there was  a stronger reason, more deeply felt than avarice. I theo- rize that those who founded this neighborhood recog- nized it as a special place. One thing that makes it spe- cial: you can see the stars here. You can’t see them from  most areas of the city.  Despite much visible evidence to the contrary, it also  appears that folks who don’t live in Sandia Heights like  to see the stars. That’s why in 2000, the New Mexico  Night Sky Protection Act was signed into law by Gover- nor Gary Johnson. Bernalillo County followed with its  own “Article VI—Light Pollution.” Both are worthy of  reading, but I’ll summarize the high points of the two  documents:  • Keep your light on your own property, rather than  shining into the street or onto your neighbor’s prop- erty.  • Shield your light so it shines down, onto the ground  or your building, not up into the sky or out into the  eyes of passerby.  To my sensitive eyes, compliance with these two in- structions will go far towards making you a good neigh- bor, at least after dark.  To achieve full harmony with your surroundings,  though, you’ll also need to go beyond the basics and  consider something called lighting color temperature.  This is a number printed on every light bulb package  that is derived from how close in color the light emitted  is to the color a piece of tungsten glowing at a set tem- perature (in degrees Kelvin). Put more simply and ap- plied to the point of this article, this is whether the light  source looks visually “warm” or “cool.” Light bulbs  (called “lamps” in the lighting trade) are usually availa- ble between 2700K and 6000K. The low side, 2700– 3000K, are usually called “warm white.”  The high side,  4500-6000K, are often called “daylight.” I’ll try to save  you a lot of trial and error: unless it’s your goal to sleep  poorly and have your house look like the inside of a Su- per Walmart, stick to the lower numbers. 2700K (called  “warm white”) has an orange/yellow tone, and corre- sponds to the color of an incandescent bulb. Psycholog- ically, it is cozy and inviting. 6000K (daylight) looks blue,  corresponding to the color of the sky at mid-day. When  used for a lamp, though, the “daylight” fixture looks  blue or cold silver.  Research has shown that blue lights  4   The GRIT August 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 8    JUNE CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

As a last word on color temperature, after you’ve  chosen the color temperature for your house (hopefully  2700–3000K), try to stick with it throughout your prop- erty. A house with mismatched color temperature is a  disjointed, awkward, unintentional-looking thing.      To summarize, and to bring us back to the original  question: now that we can do anything with light, what  should we do? For your consideration, here are my rec- ommendations:  • After dark, turn on all your outdoor lights, then go  stand in the street (safely, of course!) and look at  your house.  See what you think. Does the glare hurt  your eyes? Are the color temperatures mismatched?  • If your lights shine into your neighbors’ yards or the  street, re-aim, modify, replace, or eliminate them.  • If your lights shine up into the sky, re-aim, modify, re- place, or eliminate them.  • If your outdoor light fixtures glare into peoples’ eyes,  replace them with “full cutoff” fixtures where the  light bulb filament isn’t visible. Light belongs on the  ground or on a building, not shining in your eyes.  • Consider that indirect lighting, with hidden light  sources that shine onto the ground or your house, al- most always look better than exposed filaments that  hurt your retina.  • If you have globe fixtures, which I’ll admit look great  on certain houses from the 60s and 70s, make sure  the globe is frosted, so it’s not so glare-y.  • Eliminate the use of any fixtures that have an ani- mated “flicker,” change color, dance around, etc.  They are too eye-catching to be polite. Light for our  houses should be quiet and relaxing.   • Some of our home-mounted devices (think fans, air  conditioners, pumps) have glowing or flashing red or  green LEDs. If this flashing LED isn’t performing an  essential service, be kind and cover it with a piece of  electrical tape or a dab of paint. Nobody wants to  look into the night and see random mystery lights.   • Get rid of motion detector “security” lights that  come on unexpectedly and blind folks. If you don’t  want to get rid of them, at least shield the  bulbs/lamps from view. Also note that there’s noth- ing to keep you from putting a motion detector on a  fully shielded fixture.  • Don’t fall for the latest lighting trend, whether it’s  “carriage lights,” “Edison bulbs,” or “flicker bulbs.”  The trend won’t last, but your out-of-style lighting  will. Go for timeless and simple.  • Match your lights to the style of your house. If you’ve  got a Southwest Modern house from the 1970s, it  won’t look right with faux gaslamps. Consistency in  style will maintain your property value better than  mismatched updates, and your eye will appreciate  the cohesion.  • Edit your lights, getting rid of the extraneous and un- necessary. With lighting, less can be more. I’m look- ing at you, Costco solar pathway lights we received  as a gift 10 years ago.  • Remember, good lights make for good neighbors.  Thanks for your attention, and happy light-fixture ed- iting. Please watch for the next Architectural Observa- tions installment, when we’ll be exploring color.  [Ed: The County has a lighting ordinance and many  unit covenants do, as well. Check those first.]    Tumbleweed Control—Let’s Go, People!  A concerned resident    Tumbleweeds are an aggressive invasive species of Rus- sian origin that will take over if allowed to do so.  Homeowners, we need to prevent tumbleweeds  from growing up and going to seed. Once they go to  seed, they break off and roll around in the wind, spread- ing their seeds far and wide. Recently, I found tumble- weeds as far east as 365 Trail. The two worst areas near  me are to the east of Tramway Lane and Hawks Perch,  and the NW corner of Live Oak and Juniper Hill. West of  Hawks Perch on Tramway Lane to the south all the way  to the arroyo on the west side there is not one tumble- weed. This is due to my weeding efforts and indicates  that with diligence it is possible to control the scourge.  But it is a battle I can’t win without help.   Yesterday a fully grown tumbleweed blew into my  yard. When they get big, they are very hard to deal with  properly.

In that amount of time, I can—and have— pulled 50–100 young, green tumbleweeds. I have  pulled 1000s of little green tumbleweeds this year  alone. Same last year. I am losing the fight. Moral of the  story: do not let them grow up. Pull them now when  they’re still green and small. Let’s do this together!          Elena Gallegos Open Space   Site Improvements Survey  Environment & Safety Committee    We extended the date of the survey to make sure we  received all your inputs. If you read last month’s GRIT,  we presented to Mayor Keller our latest data and a  summary of what SHHA members think about the  proposed site improvements. We received 368  responses. Here is a summary of the final results, with  the complete results available on the SHHA website.   Of those taking the survey, 55% use the EG open  space at least once a week. 54% of those surveyed  ranked hiking as number one reason, followed by  interacting with nature, use of the picnic areas, open  space events, and biking.  Trail improvements ranked #1 as the most important  improvement needed, with 260 positive responses,  and then picnic area updates.  • 73.3%, 269 out of 367 responses, voted “no” to an  Education and Event Center facility.  • 79.0%, 289 out of 366 responses, voted “no” to a  parking lot.  • 55.3%, 202 out of 365 responses, voted “no,” and  33.7%, 123 responses, voted “yes,” to widening  Simms Park Road from 22 to 34 feet.  • 76.2%, 279 out of 366 responses, voted “yes” to the  repair and maintenance of existing trails and  facilities in Elena Gallegos.  The construction of an Education and Event Center  was your greatest concern in regards to potential  negative impacts; the parking lot a close second.  If the City moves forward, you are most concerned  with the added traffic and congestion, impact to  wildlife, and noise. Followed by the parking lot and  overcrowding of the park and trails, and then increased  crime and fire risks.  We will summarize other comments regarding this  project and present all of this to the City at a future  date. Thank you all for participating. We hear you, and  will continue to keep you up-do-date.      12   The GRIT August 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 8  Procedures for Attendance   of Guests at SHHA Board   and Committee Meetings    1. Any member of SHHA is entitled to attend  committee or Board meetings.   2. However, if planning to attend, the SHHA member  must let the SHHA Office or host (e.g., committee  chair) know of their desire to attend at least one day  ahead of the meeting.  3. If the member plans to make a statement, they must  notify the host when asking to attend. The  procedure for statements is that the member has 5  minutes at the beginning of the meeting to make  their statement and the Board or committee  members are allowed up to 5 minutes to seek  clarification, if needed, of the guest’s statement.  Discussion of the statement is done in executive  session where only Board or committee members  are allowed.  4. The number of guests allowed to make statements  will be limited to two, on a first come first served  basis.  5. Committee Chairs and the Board chairperson can  place the meeting in executive session, as  appropriate, and guests must leave the meeting for  such executive sessions. Please note that much of  the committee work of the Architectural Control  Committee and Covenant Support Committee are  conducted in executive session.  6. The process for SHHA members attending meetings  as guests is to place the guests in a “Waiting Room”  either a physical one (when we are having an in- person meeting at the SHHA office) or a virtual one  during a Zoom online meeting. Once their status as  an SHHA member is confirmed, the guests are  allowed to enter the meeting with the permission of  the Host.

Also known as North Domingo Baca  Sports & Fitness Center, or as one of Albuquerque’s  “50+” Sports and Fitness centers which fall under the  Department of Senior Affairs. For an annual member- ship fee of just $20, we have access to low-cost classes  and activities not only at NDB Center, but at any of Al- buquerque’s community centers. The facility offers  programs not just for the 50+ crowd. NDB offers inex- pensive breakfasts and lunches Monday–Friday (lunch  requires a reservation), an indoor track, a rock-climbing  wall, a fitness center (with mountain views!), and a  skate park. The Center’s current list of classes covers a  broad range of activities—everything from photog- raphy to French to arts and crafts to dancing. Bible  studies, an Italian culture group, Rotary Club, mahjong,  and support groups for multiple sclerosis and fibrom- yalgia meet at the Center. Fitness classes in Zumba,  pickleball, Jazzercise, yoga, badminton, martial arts,  basketball, aerobics, hula, ethnic folk dancing of differ- ent sorts, or just “open gym” time are available. Clas- ses often involve fees, but very affordable ones. Other  class instructors welcome donations.  The NDB Center hosts community events, too, such  as teen game nights, field trips, family movie nights and  game nights, arts and crafts, and dance nights.  See North Domingo Baca Sports & Fitness Center —  City of Albuquerque (cabq.gov) for more information.          Monthly Fun Fact    This is probably no surprise. More chiles are grown in  New Mexico than all other states combined. No lie  that, as our license plates state, New Mexico is the  “Chile Capital of the World.”  And what about that terminal “e”? According to  Merriam-Webster, in American English, “chili” is the  most common spelling for the spicy peppers as well as  the stew and hotdog topping. In British English the pre- ferred spelling is “chilli.” In Spanish speaking countries  and regions of the U.S. including New Mexico, “chile”  is the most common variant. Your editor is pleased to  note that in New York Times Cooking recipes, they spell  it “chile”!            15   The GRIT – August 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 8  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
