Representing the City of Albuquerque were Da- vid Simon, Director of Parks & Recreation; Colleen Lan- gan-McRoberts, Superintendent, Open Space Division;  and Jim Sattler, Open Space Division.  Superintendent Langan-McRoberts presented an  overview of the proposed site improvement plan to in- clude the public planning process thus far, recent site  improvements, and needed maintenance/site improve- ments to the existing facilities. Also discussed was the  proposed education center with possible locations, the  proposed Simms Park Road update and potential park- ing lot off Simms Park Road in the Pino Arroyo. The City  has not procured money to make these improvements  yet, which may be 2–3 years away. Many of the ques- tions we and you had, along with the missing details in  the Feasibility Study, will start to be answered with on- going studies currently underway, e.g., an environmen- tal impact study.  Presentation soon to be available on their website:  https://www.cabq.gov/parksandrecreation/open- space/lands/elena-gallegos-open-space  E&SC presented the initial results and comments  from our survey to the City representatives. To date, we  have had over 250 responses. Highlights from the re- ponses thus far:  • Over 70% of our residents use Elena Gallegos Open  Space and foothills/hiking trails every month.  • The majority of residents agree with doing the trail im- provements and maintenance projects: 74% stated  trail improvements were choice #1.  • 72% of respondents disagreed with the construction of  a 4800–6500 sq. ft. education facility.  • 50% ranked offsite parking as the lowest priority, with  75% saying “no” to building a parking lot at Tramway  and Simms Park Road in the Pino Arroyo.  • Widening the road: 36% said “yes,” 55% said “no.” See  the road graphic for what “widening” implies.  A complete analysis of the survey data will be presented  in next month’s GRIT. Interim data can be found on the  SHHA home page.    The meeting concluded with a commitment from the  City to keep us involved and in the communication loop  so we are up to date on what’s happening. We will give  you other opportunities to stay involved in subsequent  GRIT articles, including maintenance funds needs pro- vided through Open Space Alliance, volunteering op- portunities in the Open Space, fire watch training, and  National Trails Day activities on June 4. If you’re inter- ested in the last item, see  https://www.cabq.gov/parksandrecreation/open- space/events/national-trails-day-2  TAKE THE SURVEY  There is still time for everyone to express your opinions  and concerns regarding the Elena Gallegos Open Space  via a survey that was email blasted April 27/8. Didn’t get  an email? Use the link below to respond to the survey  by June 10. The purpose of the survey is to:  • Inform Sandia Heights residents of the proposed ex- pansion project for Elena Gallegos Open Space and  Simms Park Road.  • Obtain input from residents regarding the current  Elena Gallegos Open Space project with a focus on the  aspects of the project that uniquely impact Sandia  Heights residents.  • Guide the SHHA board in developing a position and  strategy that reflects homeowner concerns.  https://www.survey- monkey.com/r/SHHA_Elena_Gallegos_Open_Space- Survey   The last day to respond to this survey has been ex- tended to June 10. There will be other surveys and meet- ings to get your opinions as we obtain more information  and after some of the current studies are completed  later this year.    Existing Simms Park Rd Section  Potential Simms Park Rd Section  3   The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6    CSC is Working to Prevent   Long-Term RV Parking  Covenant Support Committee    The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) faces many  challenges in our goal of tightly enforcing the Use Re- strictions for Sandia Heights. The CSC currently has  eight committee members—all volunteers—who typi- cally handle 40–50 complaints per year. We are investi- gating about 10–12 complaints at any given time. The  CSC goes to great lengths to protect the identities and  addresses of both complainants and alleged violators  and the nature of the complaint. All CSC meetings are  held under “Executive Session” and the CSC meeting  minutes are strictly confidential. Both the meeting  agenda and minutes are for recording purposes only;  they are never released outside the committee.    Because of confidentiality, the work of the CSC is not  highly publicized in The GRIT newsletter or posted on  the SHHA webpage. However, beginning with this arti- cle and in a series of articles to follow, we are striving to  better inform homeowners and SHHA members of the  work the CSC is doing to enforce the Use Restrictions.  These will be high-level overviews only, without divulg- ing confidential information. Each article will focus on  one of the major issues facing the CSC—that is issues  with the largest number of complaints having the great- est impact on the Sandia Heights community.  There are 38 units in Sandia Heights, each with its  own set of covenants, although they are similar in their  restrictions. All the Unit Covenants are posted on the  SHHA website. These covenants are filed with the Ber- nalillo County Clerk and are legally enforceable in the  courts. A typical Unit Covenant has two parts: the first  part addresses major construction requirements and is  primarily the responsibility of the Architectural Control  Committee (ACC), and the second part addresses the  Use Restrictions and is the responsibility of the CSC.  It is important to note that the CSC only acts on com- plaints filed by SHHA members with the SHHA office.  The CSC does not patrol the neighborhood. Each com- plaint is handled by a committee member employing  the same rigorous investigation activities for every com- plaint filed. The work of the CSC directly supports the  SHHA Mission Statement which has two objectives:  maintaining property values and preservating the qual- ity of living in our Sandia Heights community.        Recreational Vehicle Parking is Prohibited Long-Term  All Unit Covenants prohibit the long-term parking of  recreation vehicles, house trailers, pickups with large  overhead campers for living, towed trailers and com- mercial vehicles with living accommodations, and simi- lar vehicles. The ability of the CSC to enforce these Use  Restrictions has been upheld several times in District  Court. It requires no stretch of the imagination to see  that long-term parking of such vehicles degrades both  property values and the quality of life in Sandia Heights.  No homeowner wants their neighborhood to look like a  trailer park. (It should be noted that an RV parked in an  enclosed garage and not visible from the street is per- mitted.)  Since January 2021, the CSC has received 20 com- plaints about RVs and similar camper vehicles being  parked long-term on residential lots. Most complaints  were resolved amicably with the violator moving the RV  to an off-site storage facility. Ignorance of the SHHA  Covenants is the excuse most often cited. In rare in- stances, the homeowner believes that for some reason  they are not subject to the covenants, and the CSC has  taken legal action against them in District Court. Some  homeowners say they are not subject to the covenants  because they are not SHHA members. However, all San- dia Heights homeowners and occupants are subject to  their Unit Covenants, members or not.    In conclusion, the CSC vigorously enforces the ban on  long-term RV parking in Sandia Heights, and has suc- cessfully concluded these cases either by resolution  with the violator or legal action through the courts. The  case load, however, continues to be a major effort for  the CSC, and is unusually high during the summer. Let’s  work together to keep Sandia Heights the high-level  community we all signed up for. If you have an RV, only  keep it at your home for 48 hours before/after a trip. The  CSC and your neighbors will thank you.    4   The GRIT June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6  APRIL CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

A Love Letter to Sandia Heights  By Eric Haskins, AIA, SHHA member    Just this evening, what may have been an Aplomado  Falcon and a Ladder-backed Woodpecker shared the  tree in my back yard.  My name is Eric, and I love Sandia  Heights.  By way of introduction, I grew up in Albuquerque— Northeast Heights, to be more exact: Mitchell Elemen- tary, Hoover Middle School, Eldorado High.  We lived in  a middle-class suburban house. It had a hipped, low- pitched roof of brown asphalt shingles.  The front of the  house was red brick.  The sides and back were ivory-col- ored stucco.  The front yard, the portion not covered by  concrete driveway and cars, was gravel. The back yard  was Kentucky bluegrass with a fruitless mulberry tree.   The house next door was brick with a grass yard and the  one on the other side was stucco with a flat roof and a  gravel yard. A house down the street had an Astroturf  lawn, and another had a dirt yard with cars parked in it.  My dad was a biologist and my mom was a real estate  agent.  Some weekends we’d travel New Mexico, hiking  and camping, talking about ecology. Other weekends, I  would ride shotgun with Mom, looking at home listings.   I saw the neighborhoods of Albuquerque from the pas- senger seat of a 1980 Mercedes diesel. We walked  through a lot of bad houses, a few good houses, one or  two amazing houses.  In 1980s Albuquerque, in Mom’s Mercedes, Sandia  Heights was a revelation to middle-school me. Some- how, we drove across an invisible boundary and crossed  over from ad hoc, schlock suburbia into a neighborhood  unlike any other. Even to my young eyes, this was some- thing special. The houses were cohesive. They looked  like New Mexico, with flat roofs and stucco the color of  the earth. Yet, somehow, they were also distinctive and  unique. They were of their time—also completely of  their place. Beautiful, harmonious buildings merged  into the landscape rather than asserting themselves  against it.    And that landscape!  It was simply amazing, snuggled  up against the sheer face of the Sandias. Pinon-juniper  hillsides, native grasses, cacti and yucca. And perhaps  most amazing of all: no gray concrete block walls to sep- arate one yard from the next. There was minimal sepa- ration between nature and people, and between people  and their neighbors. Roadrunners crossed the road;  deer grazed in yards. To my eyes, it was the first neigh- borhood I had seen that deferred to its setting rather  than rising against it. Yes, houses were present, but  somehow the landscape remained unspoiled. The land- scape made the houses special, and the houses made  the landscape special.  We stayed in our typical suburban house in the  Heights. I grew up, went off to college out of state, and  then to a big-city architect job in Houston, designing  lofts for 90s downtown pioneers, real-estate develop- ers, and a fair share of brick suburban home remodel- ers.  I worked through the first loft craze and through  the Mediterranean phase. I helped people fulfill their  dreams of open-concept kitchens, exotic hardwood  floors, and luxury bathrooms. I helped them remodel  the outdated fantasies of others.  For an Albuquerque kid, life in Houston was fast, big,  and humid. My formative years had imparted a deep  love of New Mexico, and I knew I had to make a contri- bution to the place that felt like home. With my wife at  my side, we returned in the early 2000s—back to big  skies, long views, and mountains.  And back in Albuquerque, I again designed lofts for  2000s downtown pioneers, real-estate developers, and  brick suburban home remodelers. Gradually, the size  and complexity of my projects increased. We bought a  little house in the North Valley and worked to make it  better. Seven years ago, when the time came to find  something bigger, we stumbled across the perfect  handyman special right here in Sandia Heights, the  neighborhood I fell for decades ago.  Living here in our beautiful ongoing project house is  fantastic. I’m amazed by the landscape, the deferential  quality of so much of the architecture, and the durability  of the guiding vision created when this neighborhood  was founded back in 1965.    Many nights, deer sleep in our yard. A pair of great  horned owls roosted in our tree for weeks. To me, San- dia Heights is the best place in Albuquerque. Until I lived  here, I had never heard quail call or seen a family of bob- cats. Like so many beautiful places, though, Sandia  Heights is in need of stewardship and constant care,  and it’s all so fragile.    To honor this special place, one goal of this column is  to pass on some things I’ve learned over 20+ years as a  professional architect and a lifetime of home remodel- ing. Many of our houses are in need of updates, and I’ve  been through the process enough times to have learned  some hard lessons. If I can pass on useful information  related to the homeownership challenges we all face,  then perhaps as you make your own contributions to  our shared environment, you can benefit from architec- tural experience without having to pay architectural  fees.      8   The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  26 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof   37 Rock Ridge Drive – Replace Windows  112 White Oaks Drive – Landscaping   120 Juniper Hill Road – Paving Driveway, Three Concrete  Slabs, and Coyote Fence Enclosure   147 Whitetail Road – Replace Pinon and Fruit Trees  301 Spring Creek Place – Reroof   359 Big Horn Ridge Dr – Re-stucco  345 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Re-stucco and Recoat Roof  373 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation  408 Live Oak Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation   604 Cedar Hill Road – Re-stucco, Repaint Entrance Trim  and Garage Frame  657 Roadrunner Lane – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation   793-N Tramway Lane – Maintenance/Upgrades to Decks  869-A Tramway Lane Ct. – Repair/Repaint Stucco  1038 Tramway Lane – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation   1182 Laurel Loop – Reroof   1196 Bobcat Blvd. – Re-stucco   1454 Honeysuckle Drive – Window Replacement and  Backyard Remodel/Landscaping   1560 Eagle Ridge Rd – Re-Stucco   1703 Quail Run Court – Landscaping   1908 Red Rada – New Construction  1924 Quail Run Drive – Landscaping   2002 Quail Run Drive – Replace Windows and Re- move/Replace Mailbox  2002 Quail Run Drive – Replace Exterior Light Fixtures  2153 Black Willow Dr – Install New Patio  2307 Calle de Rafael – Replace Weed Barrier and Gravel  2308 Calle de Rafael – Replace Weed Barrier and Gravel  2715 Tramway Circle – Landscaping   2775 Wolfberry Place – Re-stucco House and Walls  2881 Tramway Place – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  2888 Tramway Place – Re-stucco   7736 Cedar Canyon Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.             9  The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6 10  The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6 … continued from p. 7        11   The GRIT June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6  Beyond simple home improvement advice, I also  hope to explore the links between the quality of the  built environment and the philosophies and rules that  guide its creation. Certain philosophies guided the  development of Sandia Heights, and it may be  instructive to assess how those philosophies are  holding up today.    Full disclosure: philosophically, my goals are deeply  conservative, in that I hope to conserve the beauty of  the environment we share with each other and the  quality of life Sandia Heights residents have enjoyed for  decades. I’m not in favor of casually changing the  environment, nor of dismissing the thoughtful and  intentional rules that make this place special. Our high- desert environment is beautiful. The covenants that  have bound development here were very carefully  designed and we shouldn’t lightly modify them. I want  to perpetuate neighborliness, a spirit that has long  been present in everyday life here (as I’m told by folks  who have lived here longer than we have). I myself  hope to be a good neighbor, and I want others to  return the favor by not taking actions that will degrade  the quality of our shared spaces.  Thank you for your attention, and please check in  next month, when we explore lighting. There are only  a few songs about housing developments, but I’ll end  with a quotation from one of the best—Arcade Fire,  Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains).    Sometimes I wonder if the world’s so small  That we can never get away from the sprawl.    Living in the sprawl, dead shopping malls rise  Like mountains beyond mountains  And there’s no end in sight.  I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights.     [ed. Maybe Eric can reprise that last line for next  month’s Architectural Observation.]    What’s that Plant?  Elizabeth Edgren, CS&M Chair    Do you ever wish you had a plant expert on hand when  you’re out in the yard or walking through the  neighborhood or on the trails? When I moved here  three years ago, so many plants were unfamiliar to me.  What are those squash-y looking things along the side  of the road? What’s that scraggly bush that’s just  everywhere with the yellow flowers in late summer?  What kind of pine tree is that one in my yard where the  jays go crazy over the cones?  I say only the obvious when I say, “there's an app for  that!”  In a September 2018 article for Southwest Yard &  Garden, Dr. Marisa Thompson describes her experience  with some smartphone plant identification apps. Her  favorite at the time was Pl@ntNet. Home - Pl@ntNet  (plantnet.org). See her whole article, “There’s an App  for That: Identifying Plants with Tech Tools” at  nmsudesertblooms.blogspot.com.  In  February  2022,  she  updated  her  app  recommendations, saying, “My 3 favorite plant ID apps  are iNaturalist, Pl@ntNet, and PictureThis, in that  order. But these three don’t ALWAYS work... or even  help.” Find that whole article at “Plant Identification  When Apps Fail: Strategies for Untrained Botanists and  Impatient Plant Lovers” (same link as above).  So, what to do when apps fail? Dr. Thompson also  recommends some Facebook groups, whose users are  often helpful in solving botanical mysteries. I found the  Native Plant Society of New Mexico (NPSNM)’s  Facebook page. It says the group “is a non-profit  organization that strives to educate the public about  native plants by promoting knowledge of plant  identification,  ecology,  and  uses;  fostering  preservation of natural habitats; supporting botanical  research; and encouraging the appropriate use of  native plants to conserve water, land, and wildlife.”  They also have an Albuquerque chapter, newsletters,  events, and field trips.  How do you identify plants? What resources have  you found most helpful?

Our  Washington- state brother and sis- ter-in-law, who love  visiting  our  sunny  state, ordered us a  copy of Wild Edible  Plants of New Mexico  by Charles W. Kane.  Did you know that the  immature flower buds  of the cholla are edi- ble? And so are the  fruits after the cholla  has finished flower- ing. Clearly great care  is needed in harvesting or preparing any part of a  cholla, but the little book gives you techniques and rec- ipes for preparing de-thorned buds, as well as medici- nal uses of the pulp, and tells us that the roots are “a  soothing diuretic.”                      What about the stinky buffalo gourd found street- side throughout Sandia Heights? It can be picked when  fully mature, cracked open, its seeds dried and roasted  for an alternative to pumpkin seeds.  The  other  book,  which may appeal to a  wider audience, is Field  Guide to the Sandia  Mountains, edited by  Robert  Julyan  and  Mary Stuever. This spi- ral-bound book offers  a bit of history, a lot of  description, advice for  enjoying our moun- tains, and an impres- sively comprehensive  education on the ecol- ogy, geology, weather, plants, and animals of the San- dias: wildflower photos, drawings of tree and shrub  features, photos and descriptions of critters from ar- thropods (otherwise known to me as creepy-crawlies)  to reptiles and amphibians to birds to mammals. Not a  book to sit down and read through cover-to-cover (at  least not for me), but this book has a wealth of infor- mation and is easy to browse.    Monthly Fun Fact    According to the Washington Times, New Mexico has  more Ph.D.s per capita than any other state, mostly  due to the many Government and private research fa- cilities that call New Mexico home. The state as a whole  stands at 3.4%, with Albuquerque having 4.7%. Los Ala- mos checks in with a whopping 24.2% holding doctoral  degrees.        13 The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6 14   The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6    SH Tips & Hacks:  Home Recipes for Weed Killer,   Garden Insecticide, Insect Repellant  By Susan McCasland    Summer is almost here—a time we spray a lot of  chemicals for various reasons. There are inexpensive  and safer alternatives to many store-bought spray  chemicals. Try some of these and let us know what  you think: thegritshha@gmail.com.  Weed killer. Roundup (glyphosate) is the gold  standard in weed killer. I’ve also inadvertently killed  a tree with it and it has been implicated in a number  of health issues, including cancers, neurological and  heart problems, liver and kidney damage. So, here’s  an alternative guaranteed to be safer.  • 1 gallon of 5% or higher household white vinegar  • 1 cup of table salt or 2 cups epsom salts  • 1 tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap  Thoroughly stir the ingredients together. Funnel into  a spray bottle. Apply the solution on a dry, sunny day,  by thoroughly coating all surfaces of the weed. Plants  soaked with this solution will die within a week. Be  sure not to get this on desirable plants.   Garden insecticides and repellents. We need to be  a little more discriminating here, because we want to  get rid of the pest insects and not the beneficial in- sects. So, we need to know what the pests are we are  treating our garden for. I’m only going to give one rec- ipe here, with a link for others and what insects they  are good for. But this one is a natural for New Mexico.  • 1 quart water  • 1 tablespoon hot chile powder  • Several drops of mild liquid soap  This mixture can be sprayed full-strength on the  leaves of afflicted plants. It falls more in the repellent  than the insecticide category. Do be sure to wear  gloves and keep the spray out of your face. You don’t  want to pepper spray yourself.  For other recipes, see https://www.treehug- ger.com/natural-homemade-insecticides-save-your- garden-without-killing-earth-4858819  Insect repellents for humans. We are blessed to  not have a lot of irritating, biting, stinging insects  here. But we do have those extremely annoying gnats  for a few weeks in the summer. For the most part,  what keeps mosquitoes away will keep the gnats  away. Here’s a recipe using essential oils that should  help with gnats.  • 1 cup isopropyl alcohol  • ½ teaspoon citronella oil  • 10–20 drops of lemongrass or peppermint oil  Mix together and put in a spray bottle. Label your mix- ture with its ingredients and store in a dark-colored  bottle or keep in a dark spot to prolong its effective- ness. Test any homemade bug spray for possible aller- gic reactions before using it more liberally. Oils may  stain clothing.  Enjoy your summer!              15   The GRIT – June 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 6  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.     Sandia Heights Art Tour: Saturday and Sunday, September 17 & 18 from 10 AM – 5 PM.
