SHHA Street-side Cleanup  By Joe Boyce, Parks & Safety Committee chair    Recently, I saw a lady walking her dog have to jump into  waist high weeds on the side of the road to avoid being hit  by a truck coming down the street. The truck couldn’t see her  because of a bush growing out into the street, and I got chills  thinking of how close it came to a tragedy—a very preventa- ble tragedy. I’m sure many of us have experienced similar  events walking in the neighborhood. We can do better.   As you may know, the Bernalillo County actually owns sev- eral feet into each Sandia Heights lot from the street asphalt,  and comes out about twice a year to mow and clear this area  of the roadside. They recently did San Rafael for example,  and it made a major improvement in safety. Although the  County has the right to do this, it is actually the homeowner’s  responsibility to maintain this street-side area year-round,  improving fire risk and safety around their home. Thanks to  those of you who already keep your yard near the street clear  and unobstructed—this is preferred to the county doing it  (see photo). However, some residents still haven’t gotten  the message or are simply unable to do this critical work.  We are asking that homeowners address this need and  clear brush and plants for 2–3 feet near the street in order to  improve safety around their property. This will also reduce  liability from accidents and avoidable injuries—the “cracked  sidewalk” hazard. Another step that helps is for residents to  urge our local Bernalillo County administration and repre- sentatives to do the mowing and cutting on a regular, twice- a-year minimum basis. Antonio Jaramillo is the director of Op- erations and Maintenance with responsibility for this area.  Website: https://www.bernco.gov/public-works/about-the- public-works-division/operations-maintenance-department/  His email is aejaramillo@bernco.gov and office phone is  (505) 848-1548. Let him know, too, if you are happy with  work the County has done.  Our committee has had recent discussions about SHHA  sponsoring a commercial landscaper to clear major street  sides with homeowners’ permission, but that proposal has  several obvious drawbacks including cost, liability, and com- munication difficulty. It’s on hold for now. We ask that resi- dents provide feedback on this idea in an email to  SHHA@sandiahomeowners.org with any comments or  thoughts on this issue. Thank you for your consideration.

Where there once was a safe  lane for cars to merge, white pylons have now been  placed to narrow the entry point, resulting in cars enter- ing from Paseo Del Norte having a “Blind Spot” for ve- hicles and bicyclists coming south on Tramway Blvd. at  60+ mph.  During a recent trash pickup along Tramway Blvd.,  we witnessed several near accidents at this location in  an hour, with no significant benefit for any traffic or bi- cyclists. We have discussed this with the district 3 engi- neer responsible, Nancy Perea, to no avail. We encour- age you to visit the scene and see for yourself how bad  this intersection has become as a result of blind adher- ence to inappropriate, albeit well intentioned traffic de- sign.  Our board is unanimous in concern at the dangerous  situation that has been created as a result of this  change, and we request your assistance in rectifying the  situation, including creation of a longer merge lane and  removal of the pylons to improve safety for bicyclists  and vehicles using both Tramway Blvd. and Paseo Del  Norte. Please contact Joe Boyce at (816) 261-6304 or  mkjboyce@yahoo.com for any questions or infor- mation concerning this situation.

Letter to the Editor    I’m writing to recommend that a posting be placed  monthly in The GRIT, advising people that jog or  walk in the neighborhood foothills, on the safest  and proper method to do so.  Bikers, motorcycles, autos drive according to rec- ognized laws, on the right side of the road. Walkers,  joggers walk/jog AGAINST oncoming traffic, not  with it.  The individuals walking/jogging on the same side  and direction of traffic pose a great danger to the  traffic that must go around them, basically causing  this traffic to often drive blindly into oncoming traf- fic.  With the numerous hills and curves in our neigh- borhood, driving around walkers/joggers has nearly  caused deadly results.  Some walkers/joggers are walking dogs, are hard  of hearing, have headphones on listening to music  or are talking on their headphones or hand-held  phones, oblivious to traffic coming up behind them.  Often times walking 2–3' distant from the edge of  the street, forcing traffic to go around them to  avoid hitting them when they do not move or real- ize a vehicle is coming up behind them.  I’m sending this suggestion for the monthly GRIT  in the hope an injury or fatality can be avoided.  Best regards,  Franklin S.  [ed: Franklin, we won’t be able to publish a pedes- trian advisory every month, but here’s your caution- ary letter. And remember, everyone—safety vests  are available to members at the SHHA office for  only $2.50. They work! I have one and have noticed  that drivers notice me much sooner than when I am  not wearing it.]  9  The GRIT – January 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 1 10  The GRIT – January 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 1 11   The GRIT – January 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 1  Update on Invasive Siberian Elms  Covenant Support Committee    Articles on invasive vegetation, including the Siberian elm, have recently been published in The GRIT (November  2020, October 2021, November 2021). This article serves to reinforce the message that the Siberian elm is consid- ered an invasive species and that planting new trees of this type in Sandia Heights is prohibited.   Although the Covenants for all but two Units mention “Chinese” elms as the prohibited tree, the Chinese elm  is generally not considered to be the invasive type that was the original intent of the Covenants; rather the Sibe- rian elm is considered to be the more invasive and, hence, prohibited tree.   One characteristic that aids in distinguishing between the two types of elm is the bark on mature elms, which  is deeply furrowed on the Siberian, and much smoother on the Chinese. The bark of a mature Chinese elm is  comparatively smooth and has a distinctive light-colored mottling, hence the Chinese elm is also referred to as  the lacebark elm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmus_parvifolia). See photos below for the bark types on mature  trees.       Chinese elm bark (left) and Siberian elm bark (right). Notice the roughness of the Siberian elm bark. (Natesnursery.com)    Our understanding is that most, if not all, of the invasive elms in Sandia Heights are Siberian elms. Chinese elms  are not nearly as prevalent in New Mexico as are Siberian elms (“Rethinking the dreaded Siberian Elm,” Rebecca  Moss, Santa Fe New Mexican, 2017). However, Siberian elms actually make up a significant portion of the tree  canopy in places like Taos and provide beneficial shade in an increasingly drying environment. (R. Moss, 2017).  Note that some sources list all elms as invasive in New Mexico (Treesforme.com).  The November 2020 GRIT article informs the neighborhood that removal of mature Siberian (invasive) elms will  not be enforced by the CSC, due in large part to the high costs of both removal and litigation, but an additional  consideration is that the mature elm trees can provide beneficial shade. However, the October 2021 GRIT article  reminds us that it is the homeowners’ responsibility to maintain their yards, and as such immature Siberian elms  should be removed as soon as possible after they are observed. Identifying whether young elms are Siberian or  Chinese can be difficult, because the leaves are similar and the bark has not attained the distinguishing character- istics that mature elms exhibit. When in doubt it is probably best to remove all young elm trees in a timely fash- ion—and this is most easily done when they can be pulled out rather than dug out. (See photo on page 14.)

The picture on the right shows a close-up of the seedlings/sprouts  invading the garden. These seedlings/sprouts have since been removed by the homeowner—before the situation  got any worse.

Moss, 2017), and can also be  damaging to foundations, driveways, walls, patios and walkways. You most certainly don’t want these trees any- where near your septic system components.  The Charter for the Covenant Support Committee states that, together with the SHHA, we aim to promote  the common interests and welfare of homeowners, property owners and residents within Sandia Heights and to  preserve the unique character and quality of life of the area. As such, we maintain a level of stewardship of the  environment as articulated in and consistent with the original intent of the Covenants. With regard to invasive  elm trees, the CSC will enforce removal of immature trees when valid complaints are submitted to the SHHA  through the proper protocol.    SH Tips & Hacks    Little Green Bucket. Did you know that there is a paid service you can sign up for to turn your garbage and food  scraps into compost? It’s called Little Green Bucket, and you can visit their website at https://littlegreen- bucket.com/. You have a choice of receiving a bag of compost twice a year or having it donated to a local com- munity garden, farm, or non-profit. When you sign up, you get a…well…little green bucket to fill with your food  scraps. Leave the bucket outside on your collection day. The service will pick up the full bucket and exchange it  for a clean, empty bucket. That’s all there is to it. You can elect to have the bucket picked up weekly, biweekly,  or monthly. No more worrying about putting out your regular trash can overnight during the active bear months.  If you have a garbage disposal, there will be less going down it and, hence, less filling your septic tank or going  to the sewage plant. And you’re not adding garbage to our landfills.                  14 The GRIT – January 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 1 15   The GRIT – January 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 1  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.

History of New Year’s Celebrations  from History.com    Civilizations around the world have been celebrating the start of each new year for at least four millennia. To- day, most New Year’s festivities begin on December 31 (New Year’s Eve), the last day of the Gregorian calendar,  and continue into the early hours of January 1 (New Year’s Day). Common traditions include attending parties,  eating special New Year’s foods, making resolutions for the new year and watching fireworks displays.  The earliest recorded festivities in honor of a new year’s arrival date back some 4,000 years to ancient Baby- lon. For the Babylonians, the first new moon following the vernal equinox—the day in late March with an equal  amount of sunlight and darkness—heralded the start of a new year. They marked the occasion with a massive  religious festival called Akitu (from the Sumerian word for barley, which was cut in spring) that involved a dif- ferent ritual on each of its 11 days. In addition to the new year, Atiku celebrated the mythical victory of the  Babylonian sky god Marduk over the evil sea goddess Tiamat and served a political purpose: It was during this  time that a new king was crowned or that the current ruler’s divine mandate was symbolically renewed.  Throughout antiquity, civilizations around the world developed increasingly sophisticated calendars, typi- cally pinning the first day of the year to an agricultural or astronomical event. In Egypt, for instance, the year  began with the annual flooding of the Nile, which coincided with the rising of the star Sirius. The first day of the  Chinese new year, meanwhile, occurred with the second new moon after the winter solstice.  The early Roman calendar consisted of 10 months and 304 days, with each new year beginning at the vernal  equinox; according to tradition, it was created by Romulus, the founder of Rome, in the eighth century BCE. A  later king, Numa Pompilius, is credited with adding the months of Januarius and Februarius. Over the centuries,  the calendar fell out of sync with the sun, and in 46 B.C. the emperor Julius Caesar decided to solve the problem.  He introduced the Julian calendar, which closely resembles the modern Gregorian calendar that most countries  around the world use today. As part of his reform, Caesar instituted January 1 as the first day of the year, partly  to honor the month’s namesake: Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, whose two faces allowed him to look  back into the past and forward into the future.   In many countries, revelers often enjoy meals and snacks thought to bestow good luck for the coming year.  Other customs that are common worldwide include watching fireworks and singing songs to welcome the new  year, including Robert Burns’ ever-popular “Auld Lang Syne.” The practice of making resolutions for the new  year is thought to have first caught on among the ancient Babylonians, who made promises in order to earn the  favor of the gods and start the year off on the right foot. (They would reportedly vow to pay off debts and  return borrowed farm equipment.)  In the United States, the most iconic New Year’s tradition is the dropping of a giant ball in New York City’s  Times Square at the stroke of midnight. Millions of people around the world watch the event, which has taken  place almost every year since 1907.
