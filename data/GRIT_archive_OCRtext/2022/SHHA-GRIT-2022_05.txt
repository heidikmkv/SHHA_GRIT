Recently, I talked to friends who live in northwest Denver, about half a mile  from the 100 mph, wind-fed “Marshall fire” in late December that de- stroyed over 1000 buildings and killed two people. The fire reportedly  moved at over 100 ft/sec at times!  Until that day, they had the typical “can’t  happen here” mentality that I fear many of our residents share.  They were  terrified and “in the dark” as the fire approached their home, and said they  will always be better prepared in the future, including signing up for reverse  911 (www.nixle.com) and having a solid plan for what to take.    In addition to the fire prevention brochure Sandia Heights residents re- cently received in the mail from Sandia Services, here are several “lessons  learned” to consider, gleaned from multiple sources:   1. Right now, clean any flammable items away from your home to improve  your home’s chances of surviving.   2. You can’t fight a high-wind extreme wildfire—the only option is evacua- tion. Plan your evacuation now.  3. Opt-in and register for Bernalillo County’s reverse emergency notifica- tion system so you get emergency texts.  Do this at www.nixle.com.   4. Have a neighborhood evacuation plan, including alternate routes.  Choose a location where family members will meet if they are separated.  Have a single contact point outside the area with whom everyone can  coordinate and share info. Share key information with them.  5. Inventory and photograph or video your home’s contents now and save  it off-site. Have a bag and checklist (see p. 2) to grab and go. Consider a  note on the door that tells responders your information and that the  house is empty (no pets, etc.).      Aftermath of Dec 2021  Colorado wildfire.  (Photo by B.

By Joe Boyce, Environment & Safety Committee chair    There is talk of future building and construction by the  City of Albuquerque at Elena Gallegos Open Space and  Simms Park Road, including a visitor center, bicycle  lanes, and road widening. This feasibility study has been  going on for about a year.  Below are links with more  information.  We encourage you to review this infor- mation and get involved.     A lot of local folks will be affected by the changes, so  please review and comment to the appropriate author- ities. Visit the SHHA website for more information as  this issue evolves. For maximum effectiveness, please  read the materials before commenting.   Colleen Langan-McRoberts is the superintendent of  Albuquerque’s Open Space Division. (505) 768-4200 is  the admin number.   https://www.cabq.gov/parksandrecreation/docu- ments/eg_os_education_center_feasibility_study_3-4- 2022_final_draft_w_appendix.pdf   https://foothillseducationcenter.com/wp-content/up- loads/2022/01/Presentation_Meeting_For_OSD_Up- dated.pdf   Elena Gallegos Feasibility Study  Extracted from a letter by Colleen Langan-McRoberts  dated February 21, 2022    Elena Gallegos Open Space is in the Foothills at the base  of the Sandia Mountains. The Open Space protects im- portant wildlife habitat and offers majestic views, miles  of multi-use recreation trails, picnic and event facilities,  and access to the Cibola National Forest/Sandia Wilder- ness. Facilities at Elena Gallegos have not substantially  changed since it opened in 1985, while public use has  dramatically increased to over 200,000 visitors per year.  In 2021, the Parks and Recreation Dept/Open Space Di- vision began working with Dekker/Perich/Sabatini to  study potential improvements at Elena Gallegos. The  study identified needs at Elena Gallegos to maintain ex- isting features and support public use, including im- provements to the following: reservations areas, wet- lands, trails, Cottonwood Springs trail and boardwalk,  road and parking, outdoor furnishings and ADA access  to facilities. The study also investigated the feasibility  for a small education center for visitors of all ages. The  Foothills, one of Albuquerque’s most distinctive and  highly visited areas, has no environmental education  center. Elena Gallegos is ideally situated due to the ex- isting infrastructure, accessibility to Albuquerque resi- dents and visitors, history and ecology of the site and  connections to other Major Public Open Space and Wil- derness areas.     Potential Education Center. The focus of the pro- posed facility would be to provide education services  and programs to visitors of all ages (especially children)  to promote discovery, enjoyment, and a sense of con- nection and stewardship for this special area of Albu- querque, City Open Space, the National Forest, and the  natural world in general. Using similar Education Cen- ters at other natural areas as precedent, the feasibility  study suggested that a facility at Elena Gallegos might  be around 4,800 square feet of interior space that  would feature a classroom, interpretive area and of- fices. An outdoor wraparound deck would offer won- derful views of the City and Sandia Mountains. The fea- sibility study evaluated six potential locations for an ed- ucation facility, ranking all of the sites in terms of suita- bility and pros/cons. The two highest rank locations are  a site inside the loop road at eastern side of the devel- oped area, and a site on the north side of Elena Gallegos  near the Kiwanis Shelter. The education center would  have limited parking in addition to satellite parking near  Tramway with a shuttle bus connection to Elena  Gallegos, which would limit impacts and vehicle conges- tion. The concept of the shuttle is that it would not run  all the time, but only during peak use. The building  would incorporate sustainable design principles includ- ing solar energy as well as energy and water conserva- tion features. Wildlife-friendly design elements would  also be integrated including night sky protection, not al- lowing amplified noise, and supporting nesting sites for  birds and pollinator plantings. The hours of operation  for the building would be consistent with the current  hours for the property, and the uses for the facility  would be in line with existing polices.   …  Conclusions. The feasibility study identified overall  improvements needed at Elena Gallegos, and revealed  the benefits of and support for an appropriately-sized  Education Center. The study was an initial step and no  final decisions have been made.  The City will continue  to engage the public in the planning process and com- municate about any projects at Elena Gallegos Open  Space.    4   The GRIT May 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 5    MARCH CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

That’s roughly one poop bag per every 466 feet of trail.  Or, in terms of time, that’s one poop bag for every 2.5  minutes of hiking at a 30-minute-mile pace.   The ranger, Jason, also pointed out how people will  hide the bags over bringing them along to dispose of  properly.   Unfortunately, poop bags are a common sight along  many popular trails around the state, and there’s one  big reason why—no one likes hiking while surrounded  by the scent of their dog’s poop. But that doesn’t mean  it’s cool to leave the poop behind on the trail, either.  (Read more about how this can damage the landscape  here.)   One great trick for hikers with dogs is to bring a sec- ond, larger bag with a better seal along for the trek. This  way, once a poop bag is collected, it can be tucked away  without the smells. Toss a dryer sheet in there, too— eventually, you’ll probably have to open that bag again.   One bag that can work great is a gallon-size Ziploc bag  with the slider.       ____________________  * Jefferson County is a suburban part of Denver in the  foothills of the Front Range.

However, Bernalillo County (BernCo) Natural Re- sources Services introduced a new ordinance in 2014  that requires new septic systems be the Advanced  Treatment type under certain circumstances. This cur- rent article is not intended to be a comprehensive tuto- rial on Advanced Treatment units; rather, its purpose is  to raise Sandia Heights homeowner awareness about  this and other relevant issues. It is based on my casual  research and personal experience with BernCo and dif- ferent local septic companies during a recent project to  replace an entire septic system. More information on  septic systems from the county perspective can be  found on the BernCo Public Works website:   bernco.gov/public-works/public-works-services/water- wastewater-stormwater/wastewater-septic-systems/.  Note that the local septic companies are highly knowl- edgeable about the products they offer, and abundant  information about septic systems, including the ad- vanced ones, can be found online.   In the past couple of years, on a walk or drive around  Sandia Heights, one sees numerous yards being dis- turbed to replace old septic systems. Many of the sys- tems in Sandia Heights are 30–40 years old; it appears  these older systems are approaching the end of their  life and are beginning to fail. It is unfortunate that the  “natural” desert landscape has to be marred in order  to replace septic tanks and leach fields, but this is a ne- cessity when there is no sewer system, and one over  which the SHHA has no jurisdiction. According to the  EPA, about one-fifth of all households in the U.S. have  septic systems—we are not alone!   BernCo requires that a failed septic system be re- placed by an Advanced Treatment System when the  property’s area is less than 0.75 acres. The BernCo web- site classifies these types of systems as “Secondary  Systems (Class 2)”. Unlike conventional systems, Ad- vanced Treatment Systems require the active addition  of oxygen (air) to the wastewater to promote the  growth of aerobic bacteria and more efficient break- down of the suspended solids in the wastewater. Note  that for septic systems subjected to a large flow vol- ume, for example in large households, an Advanced  Treatment System may still be required by BernCo even  if the lot is over 0.75 acres.   Different septic companies deal with different septic  system manufacturers; no single company offers all the  different septic system brands and techniques availa- ble. One type of Advanced Treatment System uses a  paddle-agitator to introduce air into the sewage/efflu- ent in the multi-chamber tank. Another approach uses  an air-pump compressor to vigorously blow air into the  tank. Note that with an Advanced Treatment System,  the homeowner should not use any of the bacterial  treatment powder packs that are used with traditional  systems because the bacteria in the Advanced Treat- ment Systems come naturally from the environment.    Some practical considerations regarding the “lay of  the land” need to be recognized when replacing a  failed septic system with an advanced one. For Ad- vanced Treatment Systems, the top of the tank, and  the top of any lift stations/tanks that may also be re- quired, can be no deeper than four feet below the  ground surface, as per BernCo. This has implications if  there is significant topography in the area of the prop- erty where the tank is to be placed. To honor this re- quirement, if the elevation of the top of the new tank  is higher than the elevation of the sewer main coming  out of the house, then a lift station tank may be re- quired to store the raw sewage, and then a pump will  lift the sewage up to the septic tank itself. This pump- ing requires electricity, and this may not be desirable  with the prospect of rolling power blackouts on the  horizon. Note that septic systems cannot be placed  where the slope is greater than 15° (again, per BernCo).  An additional constraint is proximity to any drainage  easement: you cannot place a tank—regardless of  whether it is conventional or Advanced—within 25 feet  of a drainage easement. It is unclear whether this dis- tance is measured from the center of the easement.  Regardless, there are many drainages running through  our neighborhood, and 25 feet cuts a considerable  swath whether it’s measured from the center or edge.  There is more flexibility regarding proximity to ease- ments for placement of piping and the drain field.   There are various techniques for designing the drain  field, and the “footprint” of these varies. The result  may be that the current location of a failing septic tank  may not be practical for a new Advanced Treatment  System to replace it.  One way to save space regardless of the septic sys- tem type is to use a seepage pit in lieu of a conventional  leach field. Seepage pits are tall cylindrical chambers—   …continued from previous page  12   The GRIT – May 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 5  up to 12 feet tall. I know of at least one recent Sandia  Heights success where two seepage pits were in- stalled as part of a septic replacement project. How- ever, the presence of huge boulders in the ground  may prohibit using these chambers on some proper- ties, especially those that are closer to the mountains.    Another geographical constraint is simple access. I  know one resident whose neighbor has virtually no ac- cess to the septic tank in his back yard. That resident  would be willing to permit his neighbor access  through his yard, but other neighbors may not be so  accommodating. Concrete tanks are heavier than the  polyethylene ones, and require larger trucks/machin- ery to lift and manipulate them, so locations far from  roads and driveways may require polyethylene tanks.  Vegetation may have grown significantly since original  tanks were put in—trees may have to be pruned or cut  down to allow replacement.   Advanced Treatment Systems have a couple other  requirements worth mentioning. Discharge from  household water softeners, regardless of whether  they are sodium- or potassium-based, is not allowed  to go into the septic tank. Rather, the discharge needs  to be re-routed to something like a French drain some- where else in the yard, which is something the septic  company can do. And, of course, an electrical line and  switch box will have to be provided somewhere near  the air compressor/blower or agitator.   In my recent septic replacement project, I faced  many of these issues and also desired to have an en- tirely gravity-based system. Representatives from  four local septic companies examined my situation,  and proposed four different types of solutions! One  company’s preferred approach was a system involving  mechanical pumps, so that there would be a lift sta- tion (euphemism for sewage tank) right under the  back patio with a pump to pump sewage uphill from  the house to the septic tank, after which there may be  need for additional pumping. This proposal also relied  on the use of seepage pits. In hindsight, I suspect that  big boulders would have been encountered. Another  proposal required lots of trees to be cut down ahead  of time, including a large, spreading, very old juniper.  A third proposal spread the footprint of the tank and  drain field over much of my property, also required  cutting many trees for access, and could not guaran- tee pumps would not be required. Only one company  was confident that a pump-free, gravity-based system  could be installed. Although this company also pro- posed trying to use seepage pits, when they reached  solid rock at about 6–7 feet, they were nimble enough  to quickly find an alternative solution using a series of  sub-horizontal, semi-cylindrical seepage chambers— something I’ve seen in other recent replacement pro- jects in our neighborhood where space is tight. This  company also had a deft backhoe operator, who was  able to navigate between and around trees so that not  a single tree was entirely removed.   In summary, replacing a failing septic tank may not  be a simple “plug and play” if you need an Advanced  Treatment System. Beyond logistics, the expense— not discussed here—is generally greater for Advanced  Systems than for conventional ones. A couple of  words of advice if you still have your original system:  (1) follow the recommendations in the 1992 GRIT arti- cle to extend its life and (2) have a plan of action ready  for when your original system begins to fail.       This picture shows one of two Infiltrator brand seepage chambers  being installed that will be used to drain effluent exiting the septic  tank once the piping is hooked up. This chamber was used because  too much rock was encountered at depth, preventing use of seep- age pits, and because there was not enough space to accommodate  a conventional leach field. I’ve seen this approach being imple- mented at other recent septic replacement projects in the neigh- borhood. The backhoe used in the project can be seen in the back- ground. The black object and white pipe on top of the chamber just  happened to have fallen into the trench before this picture was  taken, and are not representative of the completed chamber and  trench design.   13 The GRIT – May 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 5 14   The GRIT – May 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 5  Summer Is Coming—and So Are RVs  By the Covenant Support Committee (CSC)    Summer will soon be here but, unfortunately, also re- turning are boats and RVs. When you bought or  rented in Sandia Heights, you agreed to follow your  unit covenants with restrictions on parking your rec- reational vehicles. SHHA does not look for violations,  but does investigate complaints submitted by your  neighbors whose names are not divulged. After inves- tigation, if there is a violation, you will receive a letter  from SHHA asking you to correct the problem. There  are consequences for failure to remove the RV.  In some instances, a homeowner has built a sepa- rate garage which is large enough to park the RV. The  RV is completely enclosed and not visible from the  street. This is perfectly satisfactory. The objective of  our covenants is to maintain the natural beauty and  environment of our community and, thereby, main- tain our property values. No one wants Sandia Heights  to look like a trailer park.
