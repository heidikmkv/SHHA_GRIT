Have You Seen the New Wildfire Signs?      Photo by Susan McCasland    This sign is on San Rafael just east of Tramway. They  are now at seven entry points into Sandia Heights east  of Tramway.  Remember, as the sign says, fireworks are prohibited  at all times.  If you’re wondering what the sign on the other side  says, it’s a reminder to keep any garbage locked away  until trash days so our bear friends won’t get into it.  Not really a problem for a couple of months yet.

Letter to the Editor    Thank you for yet another informative newsletter.   My husband and I recently moved into the neighbor- hood and are really enjoying the peace and quiet. One  thing I am noticing is that people really speed in these  small neighborhoods, ignore stop signs, and are very  distracted when driving. I run and walk 2 dogs and have  had to jump way off the road due to distracted drivers.  I am always yelling at people to slow down. I also be- lieve that something must be done to slow traffic down  especially on Simms Park Road.   Thank you.  Karen P.

Turns  out that’s not the only state law that leaves you scratch- ing your head. Here are a few others:  It is a misdemeanor to trip a horse. If the horse is  hurt, it becomes a 4th-degree felony.  It is illegal for women to have unshaven armpits in  public.  It is against the law to give glue to a child without a  parent’s consent.  “Idiots” are not allowed to vote.  It’s okay to bet on bicycle or horse races in our fair  state, but betting on camel or ostrich races is strictly  prohibited.  I’m looking for a knight in shining armor, because it  turns out to be illegal for a woman to pump her own gas  or change her own tire.  And finally, the law says you cannot wear a kimono  while riding a horse. Maybe because it might cause the  horse to trip?

Our Backyard Antenna Farm  By Susan McCasland  (historical article reprinted from Nov 2018 GRIT)    Ever wonder about all those antennas on Sandia  Crest? Turns out it is one of the most crowded elec- tronic sites in the world! It is home to the broadcast  antennas for numerous Albuquerque-area televi- sion and AM/FM radio stations, many commercial  two-way radio repeaters, weather radars, electric  utility radio systems, Forest Service radios, military  base services, other long-distance carriers, and sev- eral local governments’ networks, including public  safety and emergency medical services. Whew!  The antennas extend for roughly a half mile. Be- cause they are on a natural 4,500-foot “mast,” the  towers are not particularly tall.  The first towers went up in 1953 and belonged  to KOB-TV (Channel 4) and KGGM-TV (Channel 13).  Take a drive up Sandia Crest Road on the east  side to see the antenna farm up close and maybe  do a bit of hiking while there.              9  The GRIT – February 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 2 10  The GRIT – February 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 2 11   The GRIT February 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 2  Continued on next page…  Bears in the Sandia Mountains  Excerpted from Sandia Mountain Bearwatch    The bears in the Sandias are black bears. Males range  from 200–500 lbs and females 150–300 lbs. Though  called “black” bears, they come in a variety of colors  ranging from black, brown, cinnamon, red, and blond.  They sometimes have patches of white on their  chests and may have a tan or black muzzle. They are  about 3 feet high when on all fours and about 5 feet  tall when standing upright. Black bears have a strong  muscular neck and a heavy body supported by short  powerful legs. The highest point of a black bear is the  middle of the back. There is no prominent shoulder  hump as there is on a grizzly bear.  Black bears have long been viewed as forest-dwell- ing animals. However, an unbroken expanse of forest  doesn’t provide enough food for black bears. They  need berry patches and stream bottoms to satisfy  their appetite for plants and insects. You can find  black bears in virtually all forested areas of New Mex- ico. Females usually maintain a home range of five to  seven square miles. Males on an average occupy an  area of 25 square miles, although they can extend  their territories to as much as 50 square miles if habi- tat quality deteriorates.  Under ordinary conditions black bears display mu- tual avoidance of each other rather than territorial ag- gression. A sub-adult female’s territory will overlap  her mother’s range. Sub-adult males sometimes dis- perse over great distances, which helps maintain the  viability of the gene pool by reducing the incidence of  inbreeding. When habitat becomes limited or de- graded, sub-adult males may encroach on the terri- tory of sub-adult females and force them into mar- ginal areas near human population. This is precisely  what happened in 1989 when 23 bears came into Al- buquerque. All were sub-adult females driven from  their range during a period of drought.  Bears are omnivorous, which means they will eat  just about anything around (such as our garbage).  Plants compose the overwhelming majority of their  diet. Their diet varies according to seasonal availabil- ity of foods. In the spring, the diet consists mostly of  young grasses, young succulents, roots, insects and  carrion, and the nutrient-rich part of a tree just under  the bark. In summer, young grasses, sweet clovers,  dandelions, a variety of mushrooms, watercress, in- sects, chokecherry, wild raspberries, strawberries,  plums  and  apples  are  primary  sources  of  nourishment. Rocks and stumps may be overturned  in search of grubs, and yellow jacket nests may be in- vaded. Another favorite in the Sandias is the calori- cally high “bear corn,” the yellow-red root that grows  abundantly underneath oak trees.  In late August, black bears are trying to fatten up  for winter hibernation. During this period, they may  actively feed for up to 20 hours a day and may ingest  20,000 calories daily. Acorns makes up the bulk of a  bear’s fall diet with additional piñon nuts, juniper ber- ries, kinnikinnick (bearberry), and prickly pear eaten  to help store fat for the approaching winter. If neces- sary, they will feed on small rodents, maggots and  anthills. True to popular belief, bears do raid beehives  for the honey and the bees. They have been known to  raid chicken, rabbit, and hamster coops. Males may  kill and eat cubs.   In New Mexico, black bears breed between mid- May and July. Gestation takes seven to eight months.  Delayed implantation of the eggs enables the female  to breed in the summer and give birth in the winter.  This delayed implantation has been termed “an effec- tive means of birth control.” If it has been a good  feeding season and the sow has plenty of fat reserves  going into the winter season, then all the fertilized  ova will implant, meaning a large litter (up to 3); if it  has been an average feeding season, maybe just one  or two ova will implant, resulting in 1–2 cubs. And if it  has been a sparse feeding season, an ovum will not  implant at all, so that the female bear can use all her  fat reserves to keep herself alive. Even though a bear  mates in June, it could be as late as November before  the fertilized eggs are implanted. Cubs stay with their  mother 1–2 years. Therefore, the female mates about  every 2 years, shortly after “evicting” the cubs.  Of all the bears’ senses, it is the sense of smell that  is the sharpest and that the bear relies upon the most.  In fact, with proper conditions, a bear can smell a hu- man approaching from up to one mile away. While a  bear’s sense of sound and sight are not its strongest,  these senses still exceed humans’ capabilities. When  a person sees a bear standing on its hind feet, it is  most probably not trying to see better, but to smell  what is going on around it.  Black bears are considered the most intelligent  North American mammal after man. They are more  curious than a chimpanzee and have very good mem- ories. Once they find your garbage or bird feeder,  they know where to come back to and to bring along  the cubs.  … continued from previous page  12   The GRIT – February 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 2  Black bears select a surprisingly small den that has  one or more openings. The most important aspect of a  den to a black bear is that it is in a protected area. The  den is small, so that the bear’s own body heat will  warm the space. Den openings are often so narrow  that an adult human would find it difficult to squeeze  through. In New Mexico, dens are frequently located  under outcroppings of large rocks or under tree roots.  Bears gather leaves, grass, and twigs to make  insulating beds on which to curl up, leaving only their  well-furred backs and sides exposed to the cold. They  sleep alone with the exception of mothers with cubs.  Most bears use a different den each year. In bad years,  a small percentage of black bears die in dens.  Unfortunately, some young underweight bears will die  while in torpor in drought years. Since urination and  defecation don’t occur during hibernation, odor is not  produced. This significantly decreases chances a  mother bear and her cubs will be found by predators,  which include mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes and  other black bears that sometimes prey upon the cubs.  For black bears, hibernation is more an adaptation  for escaping winter food scarcity than for escaping  winter cold. Black bears do not officially hibernate but  enter a state of “torpor,” which is a modified form of  hibernation. Torpor in New Mexico normally occurs  between mid October through the end of March and  sometime later. Pregnant sows enter the dens first,  sows with cubs next, followed by younger bears and  the last into the dens are adult males. Males usually  appear first in the spring, followed by females without  cubs and finally females with cubs. Bears may move  from den to den in winter months so it is possible to  see them when they are supposed to be in torpor.  The black bear’s metabolic and digestive processes  undergo an amazing transformation during its stay in  the den. Rather than excreting, the bear has evolved  the capacity to reabsorb its waste products and  convert them into useful proteins and other nutrients.  To survive long winters without eating, drinking,  exercising, or passing wastes, hibernating bears cut  their metabolic rates in half. Sleeping heart beats drop  from a summer rate between 60 and 90 beats per  minute to a hibernating rate between 8 and 40 beats  per minute. Rectal temperatures drop only slightly,  though, from 99–102°F in summer to 88–98°F during  hibernation. Bears can maintain a high body  temperature despite their lower winter metabolism  because they have highly insulating fur and reduce  blood supplies to their limbs. Only the head and torso  are maintained at higher temperatures. Having the  brain at a high temperature enables bears to maintain  brain function for tending newborn cubs and  responding to danger.   Medical researchers are studying black bear  hibernation to learn how bears cope with conditions  that are problems for people. These findings are aiding  studies of kidney disease, gallstones, obesity, anorexia  and other human health problems. Researchers even  hope that knowledge of bear hibernation/torpor may  someday aid space travel.                    13 The GRIT – February 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 2 14   The GRIT – February 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 2  2022 Directory Photo Submissions—Some Runners-Up    As with every year, there are some great photos submitted for the front cover of the Directory that are not cho- sen.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.

St. Valentine’s Day, as we know it today, contains  vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition.   Who was the real St. Valentine? The Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine  or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred. One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during  the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those  with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree,  defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine’s actions were  discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Still others insist that it was Saint Valentine of Terni, a  bishop, who was the true namesake of the holiday. He, too, was beheaded by Claudius II outside Rome. Other  stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman pris- ons, where they were often beaten and tortured. According to one legend, an imprisoned Valentine actually  sent the first “valentine” greeting himself after he fell in love with a young girl—possibly his jailor’s daughter— who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter signed “From  your Valentine,” an expression that is still in use today. Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky,  the stories all emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and—most importantly—romantic figure.  While some believe that Valentine’s Day is celebrated in the middle of February to commemorate the anni- versary of Valentine’s death or burial around A.D. 270, others claim that the Christian church may have decided  to place St. Valentine’s feast day in the middle of February in an effort to “Christianize” the pagan celebration  of Lupercalia. Celebrated at the ides of February, or February 15, Lupercalia was a fertility festival dedicated to  Faunus, the Roman god of agriculture, as well as to the Roman founders Romulus and Remus.  By the end of the 5th century, Pope Gelasius declared February 14 St. Valentine’s Day. It was not until much  later, however, that the day became definitively associated with love. During the Middle Ages, it was commonly  believed in France and England that February 14 was the beginning of birds’ mating season, which added to the  idea that Valentine’s Day should be a day for romance.  Valentine greetings were popular as far back as the Middle Ages, though written valentines didn’t begin to  appear until after 1400. The oldest known valentine, still in existence today, was a poem written in 1415 by  Charles, Duke of Orleans, to his wife while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London following his capture at  the Battle of Agincourt.  By the middle of the 18th century, it was common for friends and lovers of all social classes to exchange small  tokens of affection or handwritten notes, and by 1900 printed cards began to replace written letters. Valentine’s  Day now is the second largest card-sending holiday of the year—behind only Christmas—with some 145 million  cards.
