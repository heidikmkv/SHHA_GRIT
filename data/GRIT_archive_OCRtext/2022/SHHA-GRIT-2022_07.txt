We’re all aware of the devastating fires in the Sangre de Cristo and Jemez  Mountains, Gila and Carson National Forests. To help keep our area from  becoming a statistic, the Sandia Mountain Ranger District is CLOSED to the  public until July 18. Unless we see some significant rain, we expect the clo- sure to be extended. You may ride the tram, but must stay on the observa- tion deck or in the tram house and Ten3 restaurant. In the foothills, Trail  365 and associated secondary trails are open south of the tram and outside  of the wilderness. Please see the map. Also, the Tijeras Pueblo interpreta- tive walk near the Tijeras Ranger Station is open, but visitors must stay on  the trail.      And remember, fireworks are NOT permitted in Bernalillo County.  Leave the 4th of July displays to the licensed pros. The very last thing we  want is for our tinder-dry neighborhood to be incinerated because some- one just had to shoot off a firecracker or bottle rocket.

The Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  receives complaints about barking dogs. However, this  is an issue over which the SHHA and CSC have no juris- diction. Dog barking can carry a long way through the  neighborhood, from one Unit to the next. Incessant  barking—day or night—can be very annoying, and neg- atively impacts the quality of life, which is indeed some- thing the CSC tries to help maintain. Incessant dog bark- ing is also a violation of Bernalillo County Code of Ordi- nance 6-47, which states that “it is unlawful for a person  to allow an animal to persistently or continuously bark,  howl or make noise common to their species or otherwise  disturb the peace and quiet of inhabitants of the county.”  Residents should submit their complaints about inces- sant barking directly to Bernalillo County, either by  phone  (505-468-1382)  or  by  email  (compli- ance@bernco.gov); alternatively, a phone call directly  to Animal Care Services can be made, 505-468-PETS  (505-468-7387). Historically, responses by the County  have been quick, even within a day, but response time  during Covid is possibly slower.  Be aware of hot feet & paws. With our summer temper- atures comes hot asphalt. Asphalt can be 40–60° hotter  than the surrounding air temperature. So, a 100+ sum- mer day can mean walking on a surface as hot as 160°F.  When walking your dog, please be aware of the temper- ature on their paws. At 125°F, skin damage and burns  can occur in 60 seconds…and 125°F asphalt can occur  with only 77°F air temps! Press the back of your hand  firmly against the asphalt for 7 seconds to verify it will  be comfortable and safe for your dog.  When the air tempera- ture is this…  …the asphalt temp can  be as much as this  77°  125°  86°  135°  95°  145°  BernCo Open Space Division   Community Events—Coming Soon  Last chance to see the exhibit, Nuestras Acequias: Re- membering our History, Irrigating our Crops, Nourishing  the Future of our Community!

SNAKES? Sandia Heights residents  have mixed feelings about snakes—some people like  them and some people don’t. So, by speaking in de- fense of snakes, I hope that folks will see snakes in a dif- ferent light. Humans seem to be hard-wired to be afraid  of snakes, even if they have never seen a snake. Living  in Sandia Heights, we share habitat with several kinds of  snakes, the most common being bull snakes (also called  gopher snakes) and rattlesnakes. Only the rattlesnake is  venomous, but all snakes are vital to controlling the ro- dent population. So please try to see snakes as good. If  you can’t bring yourself to like snakes, at least leave  them alone and think about how many more mice  would be trying to get into your house without them.  Understandably, you may not want a rattlesnake taking  up residence outside your back door. If this happens to  you, please call Bernalillo County Animal Control at  (505) 260-7450.  Rattlesnakes and bull snakes will be the only two  mentioned in this article, because bull snakes are often  mistaken for rattlesnakes. Rattlesnakes and bull snakes  have similar coloring, with black and brown markings on  their backs. This is no accident. Bull snakes try very hard  to look and act like rattlesnakes. When threatened, they  may coil and raise their heads, hiss, and rustle their tails  in dry leaves to mimic a rattle. However, they are non- venomous constrictors that kill their prey by squeezing,  and they pose no threat to humans or pets. One fool- proof distinction is the shape of the pupils of the eyes  (rattlesnakes have vertical, football-shaped pupils and  bull snakes have round pupils), but most people don’t  want to get anywhere near close enough to tell the dif- ference that way! The easiest way to tell the difference  is to look at the head: a rattlesnake has a distinctly tri- angular head with pronounced eye ridges and a neck  that is narrower than the head, while a bull snake’s head  is roughly cylindrical and the same diameter as its neck.  The other obvious difference is the body shape. Rattle- snakes are larger in diameter relative to their length and  are fattest in the middle of the body, with a blunt tail  ending in several rattles in adult snakes. Bull snakes are  more or less the same diameter the entire length of  their body. A five-foot-long rattlesnake may be three or  four inches in diameter in the middle of its body, while  a five-foot-long bull snake is probably about an inch and  a half. These photos show the differences very clearly:    Bull snake (gopher snake), Pituophis catenifer (photo by Colorado State  University)    Western diamondback rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox (photo by Arizona  Sonora Desert Museum)    Both bull snakes and rattlesnakes are shy and try to  avoid people. They usually know you’re approaching  from the ground vibration and, given the chance, they  will usually crawl away. They won’t chase you! If you see  a snake, it’s probably stretched out on the pavement or  on a sunny trail catching rays. Snakes are reptiles, and  the only way they can regulate their body temperature  is by moving to a warm area (like sun-warmed asphalt)  to get warm and to a cool area (under a tree or in the  shade of a rock) to cool off.   This affinity for getting warm by stretching out on  pavement gets many snakes killed by cars. Unfortu- nately, some people go out of their way to run over  snakes. Please don’t let this be you! If you see a snake  basking on the road, try to drive around it. If you en- counter a snake while walking, you can jump up and  down or stomp your feet to create vibrations that the  snake will feel. Then just wait until the snake moves  away. But if a rattlesnake responds by coiling and rat- tling, it’s best to take a detour! In other words, never put  your hands or feet any place you can’t see.

In the unlikely event you are bitten, don’t panic! Call  911 and keep the bite area lower than your heart to  slow the spread of venom. Snakebite kits are useless  and may even make things worse. Rattlesnake venom  is a potent toxin that kills nerves and tissue, so the best  thing you can do is to get to a hospital as quickly as  possible where you can get antivenin. Dogs sometimes  get bitten because they are curious and will put their  face right up to a snake to see what it is. If this happens,  get the dog to the veterinarian as fast as you can. It’s  another good reason to keep dogs on a leash when you  walk them on streets or trails. If you see a snake near  your house, please leave it alone—you’ll probably  never see it again. Rest assured it will gobble up mice  and other rodents and keep the population under  control. There’s never a good reason to kill a snake— they are an essential part of our wildlife habitat.    SH Tips & Hacks:  Keeping Your House Cool in Summer    Even if your air conditioner will keep ice from melting,  you want to try to reduce the load on it. And if you have  swamp coolers, these tips are even more important.  Here are some ways to keep you home cool during  these hot, hot months.  • Keep your blinds closed on the sunny sides of your  house. Not only can you save money on your electric  bill, doing this one thing can lower the indoor  temperature by up to 20°F.  • Close off rooms that aren’t frequently used. This  prevents cool air from entering during the hottest  part of the day. And remember to shut vents in these  rooms as well if you are using AC.  • Put a bowl of ice in front of a fan. It acts a bit like a  tiny and very cool swamper.  • Change out the sheets on your bed with cotton  sheets. Cotton breathes easier and stays cooler.  • Set your ceiling fans to rotate counter-clockwise.  Counter-clockwise creates a cool downward airflow.  Do the reverse in winter.  • Avoid cooking indoors. It’s time to use that grill to  avoid overheating your home with indoor heat  sources like the oven and cooktop. Beware sparks!  • Open your windows in the evening, letting in the  cool night air. Be sure to close them in the morning  before the outside air becomes warmer than the  inside air.  Monthly Fun Fact    Did you know that New Mexico has been producing  wine longer than anywhere else in North America? In  fact, since the early 1600s! Spanish padres needed wine  for communion. But a Spanish law prohibited Spanish  grapes from being exported and planted in foreign soil.  In 1629, Fray Garcîa de Zuñiga and Antonio de Arteaga  smuggled vines out of Spain and planted New Mexico’s  first grapes in a field just south of modern-day Socorro.  The variety that was planted is currently known as the  Mission grape and is still grown in New Mexico today.   Your editor has a friend who makes wine from 100+  year old Mission vines near Placitas. (And, ahem, it’s  not particularly good…but, hey, it’s different!)

From: Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  Roger Hagengruber, President  To: Tim Keller, Mayor,  City of Albuquerque & Open Space Staff      Re: Opposition to Elena Gallegos development     Sandia Heights Homeowner’s Association (SHHA) recently became aware of the feasibility study and po- tential development in the Elena Gallegos (EG) open space adjacent to our neighborhood, which would in- clude 4 main aspects: 1) development of a new 5-6000 sq ft “education center,” 2) widening of the Simms  Park entry road, 3) a new parking lot on the NE side of Tramway and Simms Road in the Pino Arroyo, and 4)  maintenance/improvements  of  the  trails  and  current  EG  infrastructure.  Details  are  at  https://www.cabq.gov/parksandrecreation/documents/eg_os_education_center_feasibility_study_3-4- 2022_final_draft_w_appendix.pdf     We appreciate the email of June 10 from Open Space superintendent Langan-McRoberts stating that the  most contentious aspects of the study, the parking lot, a new building, and street widening, will undergo  further discussion and study this summer and fall. Until that time, we want to make our position clear.     We have surveyed our SHHA members and received clear and consistent feedback from over 370 resi- dents, showing over 75% oppose both the proposed building and parking lot development, and 55% of them  oppose the widening of Simms Road. A majority (~75%) of our residents do support improvements to the  existing trails and infrastructure, if done appropriately within the current EG usage (e.g., no night use, with  trash and crime prevention). We shared preliminary results with CABQ Open Space staff in early May, and  have toured the proposed sites with them to make sure we understand the consultant’s recommendations.  We do not take our position lightly, and support education and open access for the public to explore nature  on City lands. However, we do not feel a building or new, greatly expanded parking lots are necessary or  appropriate for this area. Our residents are upset, angry, and very concerned that the three areas in debate  are being considered. It will destroy the very thing it purports to value—open space! Other than the trail/in- frastructure maintenance, we believe this project will increase crime, fire risk, noise, and damage to the nat- ural setting, along with other deleterious effects, including to the wildlife in the area.    If the desire is truly to appreciate open space and nature, and to adhere to the original deed stipulations  agreed upon when the area was sold to the City by the Albuquerque Academy, we encourage the City to  leave the area as it is, with only necessary maintenance and update to the existing natural habitat and trails.  A new structure is not necessary to enjoy the outdoors or for education, and a Tramway/Simms Road parking  lot will only create an eye-sore that will undoubtedly be misused. We look forward to working with the City  in any constructive and positive fashion to improve use of the area, but will oppose any development of a  building, parking lot, or widening of Simms Road that negatively affects our residents.    Please contact our offices at 505-797-1193 or email shha@sandiahomeowners.org if you have any ques- tions or wish to discuss this further. Thank you for your consideration.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
