By Dale Arendt, Vice President and Chair, Nominating Committee    The Board of Directors works on the community’s behalf. Several Directors’  terms expire in February, and we need to identify new candidates soon. Ac- cording to our Bylaws, we must have a minimum of 11 in order to transact  business. With the upcoming expirations, we would fall below that number  without new Board members. We invite you, our SHHA members, to con- sider joining our Board. Terms are three years, renewable once. Eligibility  requirements are:  • You must be a property owner in Sandia Heights.  • You must be a member of SHHA with paid, up-to-date dues.  • You must be both willing and able to serve and to uphold the Bylaws.  The Board meets at 6:30 PM on the second  Wednesday of every month, except February.  Depending on current Covid conditions,  meetings may be in person at the SHHA office  or via the Zoom virtual meeting app. Service  on the Board is a great way to meet your fel- low homeowners, get involved with projects,  and contribute to the management and well- being of our wonderful community.   If you’d like to attend a Board meeting,  please contact the Office at least a day in ad- vance.  If you wish to join the Board, fill out a  Statement of Interest (download under the Board tab on our website or  obtain from the Office), and submit it to the Office. You’ll then hear from us  promptly. Thank you from the Board!      2   The GRIT – September 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 9  Continued on page 3…  Finding Like-Minded Folks  Community Service & Membership Committee    If you could pursue a new hobby, what would it be?  Woodworking or fiber arts? Hiking, photography, or  daytrips? Music or dancing or writing? What kind of in- terests have you set aside but want to resume? Eating  out? Cars or trains? Art or chess or …? What do you love  to do that you’re keen to share with others? Would your  existing hobby group like to bring in new people? Are  you hankering for a playgroup with other families with  young children, but don’t quite know where to look or  how to start one?  Sandia Heights residents are all sorts, with a variety  of ages, backgrounds, experiences and interests. So,  there is sure to be someone else here who shares your  interests, would like to try new things, or wants to get  back to an old pastime with likeminded folks. The Com- munity Service & Membership committee would love to  help you connect with each other. We can write up an- nouncements, news, ideas—brief or long—for The  GRIT; we can put flyers into the new resident welcome  bags; we can put info and sign-ups in the office.

Trouble with Tumbleweeds  By Stan Davis, Resident    This article aims to complement and reinforce the mes- sage in the timely article in the August issue, “Tumble- weed Control—Let’s Go, People!” by a concerned resi- dent. You may have seen brown, dried-out tumble- weeds blowing across Tramway Boulevard, but tumble- weeds can also be seen growing in large quantities in  many yards and along roadways in Sandia Heights.  What do many of these areas have in common? These  areas have had their soil disturbed by septic projects,  construction projects or other types of activity. Tumble- weeds, and other plants such as ragweed and stickseed,  are opportunists, and will grow easily in newly dis- turbed soil. Tumbleweeds start off as soft, green,  ground plants, and grow very quickly into dense, bushy  plants up to four feet in diameter, with stiff branches  and prickly leaves. The best time to remove tumble- weeds from your yard, as was stressed in the August ar- ticle, is when they are still relatively small and green— certainly long before they have turned brown and gone  to seed in the fall. They are relatively easy to pull out of  the ground when they are still green and small, and you  should do so by grasping the main stalk and branching  stems around it close to the ground, and by pulling gen- tly to extract the root without disturbing the soil much.   Tumbleweeds may be an iconic symbol of the West,  but they originated in the Ural Mountains in central Rus- sia (hence its other common name of Russian thistle),  and are an invasive plant species. According to Karie  Luidens (“The Humble Tumbleweed,” 2016, newmexi- cology.com), tumbleweeds take root in dirt that has  been disturbed and become inhospitable to other  plants. Salsola Kali, in an article on White Sands  (nps.gov, “Russian Thistle”, 2020) says that the tumble- weed competes with other plants, and although young  sprouts and seeds provide forage for animals, the ma- ture plant is not edible and can be toxic to animals. Tum- bleweeds can also carry a virus that hurts garden crops,  including tomatoes, melons and chiles (R. Sholedice and  M. Renz, 2006, aces.nmsu.edu, “Russian Thistle,”  NMSU). Anna Bengston (“Trouble with Tumbleweeds,”  2017, WildAboutUtah.gov) says tumbleweed seeds re- quire little moisture to germinate and grow, and that  drought conditions help promote the plant’s prolifera- tion. One distinguishing characteristic of a still-green  tumbleweed is a green-and-purple striping along the  main stalk and lower branches (R. Sholedice and M.  Renz, 2006, aces.nmsu.edu, “Russian Thistle,” NMSU).  The plants begin to brown and die in the fall, break off  at the base of the main stalk, and start tumbling in the  wind, distributing thousands of seeds along the way. A  yard full of abundant, dead, highly flammable tumble- weeds that do not blow away poses wildfire risk.   The City of Albuquerque has an ordinance called  “Nuisance Weed Removal” (cabq.gov), which includes  the tumbleweed/Russian thistle. Yards are being ruined  in Rio Rancho with tumbleweeds invading a neighbor- hood close to where the Rio Rancho Country Club used  to be, where the land has been left unkempt (G. Gonza- les, 2022, “It’s just been horrible: Tumbleweeds invade  Rio  Rancho  Neighborhood”).  Bernalillo  County  (BernCo)  does  not  seem  to  address  the  tumbleweed   …continued from page 2  3   The GRIT – September 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 9    explicitly, and has minimal information on “General  Weed Control,” including a YouTube “Maintenance Mi- nute” video showing people removing what appears to  be tumbleweeds “mechanically” (i.e., by not using  chemicals) (BernCo.gov, 2022). According to BernCo,  residents are required to “be aware that weed growth  on their own properties and along roads next to their  properties needs to be maintained.” I think in this con- text, “maintained” means controlled. BernCo explicitly  states that using glyphosate to chemically remove any  plant is banned. The procedure described in the August  GRIT for mechanically removing tumbleweeds that have  turned brown and gone to seed should be followed.  Generally, BernCo apparently defers to the State  (NMSU) for guidance on invasive species. Oddly, tum- bleweed/Russian thistle is not officially listed in “Nox- ious and Troublesome Weeds of New Mexico” (L. Beck,  NMSU, and J. Wanstall, NMDA, 2021), from what I can  tell. Certainly, the USDA recognizes the tumbleweed as  an invasive species (“Prickly Russian Thistle: Classifica- tion and Related Species in South Dakota and the  United States,” 2022), and Canada recognizes it as a  noxious weed (“Noxious Weeds Profile—Russian This- tle, 2022, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Ru- ral Affairs, omafra.gov.on.ca).  Tumbleweed/Russian thistle is not listed in “Foothills  Flowers of the Sandia Mountains” (A. L. Pregenzer,  2017), nor in “Sandia Mountains Natural History Cen- ter—A Field Guide to the SMNHC” (2012), nor men- tioned by Plants of the Southwest either in their bro- chure (2022) or on their website (PlantsOfTheSouth- west.com), because they specialize only in truly native  species. Tumbleweed is not mentioned in “Field Guide  to the Sandia Mountains” (R. Julyan and M. Stuever,  eds., 2005), which generally includes the Foothills above  about 6,000 feet. In short, the Tumbleweed is not na- tive to the American West, and it is an invader in Sandia  Heights and should be removed from our properties us- ing mechanical means, preferably by pulling them out  by the root when they are small and certainly before  they grow and go to seed in the fall.       Very small tumbleweeds growing along the side of the road, where soils can  get easily disturbed.    Close up of the main stalk and stems of a young tumbleweed, showing the  green and purple striping that helps to identify the plant. This striping is of- ten seen on fully mature plants, too.      Numerous small tumbleweeds are growing on this property close to the road  in an area of disturbed soil.      Medium-sized tumbleweeds grow along this road intersection. Not shown in  this article are some yards that contain numerous large—up to 4 feet in di- ameter—tumbleweeds.  4   The GRIT September 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 9    JULY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

New Mexico is blessed with 17 species of these tiny dy- namos. Some are only rare visitors, but there are four  you are likely to see in Sandia Heights, and in early Sep- tember all four species are here.  The first arrivals about late April are the Black- chinned and Broad-tailed Hummingbirds. The Black- chinned males have greenish backs and black chins  and throats with an iridescent purple stripe; females  have a green back and grey chest and belly. The  Broad-tailed males have a bright pink or red throat  and females have a dark-spotted throat. Both have ir- idescent green backs. Also, the Broad-tailed male  hummers are loud when they fly, producing a metallic  buzz! They produce this sound as air passes rapidly  through the 9th and 10th primary wing feathers.  Around the Fourth of July, the Rufous Humming- birds start arriving. These are the easiest to spot.  Males have rust-colored feathers and bright orange  throat patches. Females have rust or greenish feath- ers. Males are quite aggressive defending feeding ter- ritories. Last in, towards late July or August, is the tiny  Calliope Hummingbird. Males have red streaks on  their throats and generally green backs. The females  have green backs and an off-white chest and belly.  There are many flowers you can plant to attract  hummingbirds. You can also set up a feeder, though  be aware that bears also like hummingbird food, so  bring your feeders in at night. It is easy to make your  own hummingbird food. Simply mix 3 to 4 parts water  to one part white granulated sugar. Heat it slightly in  the microware and stir so that the sugar goes into so- lution. DO NOT USE RED FOOD COLORING as this can  be harmful to the hummers. The red on the feeder is  sufficient to attract them. Thoroughly clean the  feeder once a week or so.  Fun facts: a hummer’s heartrate is around 1200  beats per minute and they take about 250 breaths per  minute! They are the only bird that can fly backwards  and their wings move in a figure 8. They are only found  in the Western Hemisphere. They are migratory and  the ones we see in our neighborhood mostly winter in  Mexico and Central America. The Rufous goes as far  north as Alaska and northern Canada to nest. The  smallest hummingbird—indeed, the smallest bird—is  the Bee Hummingbird found only in Cuba. They weigh  less than two grams—less than a dime. That’s half the  weight of our backyard hummers.

The term xeriscape is derived from  the Greek word xeros, meaning dry. The word was  coined by the Front Range Xeriscape Task Force of the  Denver Water Department in 1981. The goal of a  xeriscape is to create a visually attractive landscape  that uses plants selected for their water efficiency.  Properly maintained, a xeriscape can easily use less  than one-half the water of a traditional landscape.  Once established, a xeriscape should require less  maintenance than turf landscape.  Why xeriscape?  • Xeriscaping Saves Water. Using native and other  drought-tolerant plants can significantly reduce  water use.  • Xeriscaping Saves Time. De-emphasizing the use of  bluegrass lawns and other thirsty plants is a  common-sense approach that can reduce the time  you spend watering, fertilizing, and mowing.  • Xeriscaping Saves Money. Reducing water use can  lower your water bill. Xeriscaping can also reduce  maintenance costs and increase the beauty and  value of your property.  Yes, desert-friendly landscapes save water, require  less maintenance, and are more appropriate for our  increasingly arid climate. You can find a free guide to the  fundamentals of xeriscape at   https://www.landscapingnetwork.com/landscape- design/xeriscape.html         Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour     The 19th Annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour will  take place September 17–18, from 10 AM–5 PM each day.  A record number of resident artists have joined Sandia  Heights Artists (SHA) and the increase in types of  artistic works has also burgeoned. In 2022, SHA has  painters of all genres, jewelers, fiber artists, glass  artists, woodworkers, featuring metal sculpture,  ceramics, photography, gourds, baskets, handmade  books, and even fine musical instruments. Most of the  tour stops offer outdoor as well as indoor displays.  Every year, SHA selects a local charity to support  during the tour. This year, the group voted to support  La Mesa Academy, an after-school arts program for  both visual and performing arts, located in the  International District of Albuquerque. During the past  two years, SHA with your generous help, has donated  $4,177.35 to the La Mesa program.

Sandia Heights Community Event:  Tramway Trash Cleanup    Got a couple of hours to help beautify our community?  Let’s pick up some trash! SHHA invites all homeowners  to join us on Saturday, October 1, from 9:30 to 11:00 AM.  We’ll remove litter along Tramway Blvd’s east and west  rights-of-way and the me- dian  between  Simms  Road and Paseo del Norte.  Meet us at 9:30 AM sharp  at the SHHA Office park- ing lot (Sandia Heights Vil- lage, 12700 San Rafael Av- enue). Please come out  and join your neighbors  for a worthy cause!    Letter to the Editor  Read Your Covenants    I recommend reviewing the covenants in your Sandia  Heights Subdivision. Recently, we had a realtor sell a  home to an investment company. The company had in- tentions of turning the property into an Airbnb. Once  we found out about this, we contacted the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association. It turned out the  covenants were written in 1986 and allowed for short  term rentals. However, we were able to amend the  covenants to restrict rentals to no less than six months.  Our subdivision voted 24 to amend and 3 to not amend.  I bring this to your attention, since it’s easier to be  pro-active than reactive. Airbnbs are trying to set up in  Sandia Heights. This could become an issue in your sub- division. Please review your covenants and make any  amendments you feel necessary to preserve our beau- tiful way of life in Sandia Heights.  Thank you, Mike Carson, Subdivision Unit 27C.  Please Do Not Feed Wildlife    The SHHA office has received reports that some resi- dents are putting out table scraps, corn and other food  for our wildlife neighbors. Please don’t. They are not  pets. They are wild animals and should forage like wild  animals.  Feeding  them  makes them look for more  food in our yards and  trashcans. Feeding wild ani- mals creates a nuisance and  a very real danger. We have  deer,  bobcats,  coyotes  bears and mountain lions.  We, our children, and our  pets are all safer, and we  have an easier time main- taining our landscaping, if  these animals are not count- ing on us for their next meal. Deer may only eat your  garden. But bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions and great  horned owls have been known to eat pets. And if you  inadvertently get between a mama bear and her cub,  you’ll quickly learn why we don’t want bears cruising  the roads looking for trashcans to plunder.  Also, you may think you are just feeding quail or rab- bits, but the larger animals are happy eating the corn  and seeds as well.   And if you need one more reason to refrain from  feeding the wildlife, it is against New Mexico State law.  For a first offense, a game warden will issue a warning;  if you continue to feed, you will be issued a citation. The  result is a court hearing, with consequences of a $500  fine and/or jail time.    Keep Sandia Heights Looking Good    We need all of our residents’ help in keeping our com- munity looking its best. Please do your part and re- member to  • Pick up after you pet and dispose of the waste  properly.  • Pick up litter you notice in the community and dis- pose of it. (And join our litter brigade beautifying  Tramway on October 1—see above.)  • Make sure household trash is secured and disposed  of properly, including not putting trashcans out until  the day of pick up (see wildlife the article above).  • Pull up and discard noxious weeds.  Thank you for taking pride in the appearance of our  community.
