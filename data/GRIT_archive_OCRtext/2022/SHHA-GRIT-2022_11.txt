SHHA is a Homeowners Association (HOA) under State  law. From its beginning, the priority for SHHA has been to preserve the  unique environment and quality of life for all the residents and to protect  the wildlife and native vegetation. To this end, hundreds of volunteers have  served over the years on the SHHA Board and its various committees. From  its beginning, SHHA has been funded through very modest dues and the  dedicated work of these volunteers.   There are currently 38 sets of covenants that apply to the various units,  each similar in nature but unique to each unit. The Architectural Control  Committee (ACC) was established by the original developers to assure that  any construction or building modification would be consistent with the cov- enants. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) was later created to ad- dress violations of the covenants. Both committees consist of volunteers  who give considerable time to the duties associated with the committee  responsibilities. They are the front line for protecting the unique environ- ment, quality of life, and property values we enjoy in Sandia Heights.  One of the unfortunate decisions made by the original developers was  to not choose a single set of covenants for all properties, which allowed  now 38 different sets to exist. Still, every property owner is obligated by  law to adhere to their applicable covenants. It is also unfortunate that  when establishing SHHA, the developers made property owner member- ship optional. Of the 38 units, only 5 now require membership. This has re- sulted in a membership rate of roughly 75% that, in turn, limits revenue to  SHHA and unfortunately contributes to a relatively weak sense of belong- ing. Still, we have been able to rely on the involvement of many members  who volunteer their time and effort to help SHHA fulfill the intent of pro- tecting and nurturing the environment that we all enjoy.  Now, to the point of all this preamble: SHHA needs Board and commit- tee members. By law, we must keep a Board of 11 or more members. The  ACC and CSC have especially critical needs. Of some 1800 total SHHA mem- bers, we have a source for volunteers.  After almost 30 years here, I found  it important that I step up to volunteer and to break the habit of being com- fortable letting “more dedicated” people serve in my stead. It is not the  easy path,  but  personal  involvement  on the behalf  of neighbors and the  Continued on page 2…  … continued from page 1  2   The GRIT – November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11    community is essential if SHHA is to continue to serve  our community.  Our costs have increased rapidly in the current fiscal  environment, as have our legal activities to protect our  community. The pool of volunteers has been too small  and that jeopardizes our effectiveness and even our ex- istence as a viable entity. As President of SHHA, I ask  each of you to consider becoming a Board or committee  member. The time demands are quite small, and the re- wards of service are high. The Board serves you and the  decisions that are made are done in the best interests  of all. What we ask of you is your confidence in us, your  understanding, and, if possible, your decision to volun- teer.  We need the help!    Elena Gallegos Education Center   Feasibility Update      A number of actions have been undertaken since the  SHHA surveyed you on the Elena Gallegos Education  Center Feasibility Study. This article is an effort to keep  you up-to-date.  A concerned group of residents, residing in both San- dia Heights and High Desert, hired a real estate lawyer  to represent our community. The lawyer has found that  the City of Albuquerque’s planned “Education Center”  in the Elena Gallegos Open Space (EGOS) is expressly  prohibited by the 1982 Purchase Agreement and Deed  put in place to protect the land. The EGOS is preserved  in perpetuity as undisturbed open space.   The following paragraph is lifted directly from the  Purchase Agreement for the EGOS made between the  City of Albuquerque and the Albuquerque Academy in  June 1982. These same restrictions are reprinted word- for-word in the Deed of the EGOS and have protected  the EGOS from development for forty years.  “5. Limitations on Use of the Park Property. The Park  Property shall be used solely by the City as a City park. The  City will limit use of the Park Property to passive recrea- tion uses which include only the installation, construc- tion, maintenance and use of picnic benches, tables, shel- ters, barbecue grills, drinking water facilities, associated  minor recreation facilities (such as volleyball or horseshoe  pitching facilities), restrooms, access roads, parking lots,  hiking trails, trail heads, a trailer or other residence for a  residential caretaker, and electric power facilities associ- ated with the specified uses.”  The real estate lawyer hired has confirmed that the  long-term consequences of the Education Center are  dire. Should the City forge ahead with violating the  Deed, they establish a precedent for buildings in the  Open Space and render the restrictions in the Deed un- enforceable by an outside party. This means that future  City administrations will be free to develop the Elena  Gallegos Open Space however they want—and there  will be no legal path for a third party to stop them.  As a community, action must be taken NOW to pre- serve Elena Gallegos in its current state and prevent the  development of the Education Center and other further  developments. You can help by signing the official peti- tion against the project:   change.org/saveelenagallegos  To stay abreast of further developments, an official  community website is being developed at  www.saveelenagallegos.org    Many Thanks   to the Trash Pick-Up Volunteers!    Thank you to the volunteers who picked up trash along  Tramway on October 1st, and worked to keep our neigh- borhood looking good! We’ll do it again in the spring— date to be announced later.    3   The GRIT – November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11  Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  Needs Volunteers  As SHHA President Roger Hagengruber mentioned in  his letter on page 1, the CSC needs new members to help  with enforcing the covenants for Sandia Heights. If you  are a homeowner and dues-paying member of the San- dia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA), please  consider volunteering and help ensure the enforcement  of SHHA covenants. We meet at the SHHA office once a  month and we have the excellent assistance of our  SHHA staff. Covenant enforcement contributes signifi- cantly to preserving our beautiful and unique commu- nity and maintaining our property values. Please share  your appreciation of the Sandia Heights community and  join the CSC. Candidates can volunteer by calling the  SHHA office at 505-797-7793 or by sending an email to  sandiaheights@comcast.net.  Somewhere Over the Rainbow  The early autumn storms have made for some lovely  rainbows over Sandia Heights. Here’s one Hector Rede  photographed on September 27. He managed to  capture most of the arc. Fun fact: the full arc of a  rainbow is about 84°. They are actually full circles with a  42° radius. It’s just very hard to see the bottom portion.   Please Respect Private Property  The office has received complaints about political  signs being removed from peoples’ yards. These are  on their private property; it is their right to express  their opinion. It is not only disrespectful, it is illegal to  take these signs. Is Your Electricity Out?  PNM has been doing some maintenance work recently  that  has  resulted  in  power  outages  and,  unfortunately, no one has been notified in advance.  The SHHA office has received quite a few calls  wanting to know who/what/why, etc. The office  doesn’t  get  notification  of  these  types  of  occurrences  until  they  receive  calls  from  homeowners. The PNM website is a good re- source: PNM.com. Here are a few tips from that  web-site.  How can I find the status of an outage? You can  view a map of outage locations and estimated restore  times at https://www.pnm.com/outage.  Is it necessary to let PNM know when my power goes  out? Yes. We may not always know if there’s an outage  at your specific location, so it’s best to let us know. You  don’t have to call, though. You can also report it  online, through our mobile site, or text #OUT to 78766.  You will need to register first by texting #REG to 78766.  How long is my food good? During an outage, the  best thing to do is to keep your refrigerator and freezer  doors closed as much as possible. Food in the  refrigerator will keep cold for about four hours if the  doors are not opened. A full freezer will keep food  frozen for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half  full) if the door is kept closed.  4   The GRIT November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11  SEPTEMBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

New Mexico designated the piñon pine (Pinus edulis),  also called two-needle pine or nut pine, as the official  state tree in 1948. Piñon is found mostly in New Mexico,  Colorado, Utah, and Arizona.  Slow-growing and long-lived, the piñon needs only 10  to 20 inches of water per year and is an excellent tree  for supporting our native ecosystem. When planted in  groups, piñon trees produce much-valued piñon nuts.  The trees are an important cover for birds year round,  including pinyon jays, Clark’s nutcrackers, Steller’s and  western scrub jays, hairy woodpeckers, white-breasted  nuthatches, and mourning doves. The pinyon jay and  the piñon pine are interdependent. The jays depend on  the nuts the trees produce as a primary source of food.  According to New Mexico Wildlife magazine, “Pinyon  jays can remember, months later and even under snow,  the locations where they have stored piñon pine seeds.  The few locations that are forgotten promote new  growth. The relationship between the tree and the bird  is critical to the survival of both.”  Few plants are more ingrained in the culture and bi- ology of New Mexico than the piñon. The species grows  very slowly, often in more dry habitats in the mountains  at elevations of 4,500 up to about 8,000 feet.  The adult  trees are usually 15–35 feet tall. The round to ovate  cones are distinctive.   Seeds (pine nuts) of the plant have been collected by  Native Americans for centuries.  This was noted by the  first Spanish settlers arriving in the 1600s. Every few  years piñon pines will produce a bumper crop of nuts  which are gathered by people, and eaten by birds, bears  and other wildlife. Have you noticed people selling pi- ñon nuts by the side of the road in the fall?      Piñon pine (Pinus edulis) closeup. Photo by Johnida Dockens  Piñon wood warms New Mexicans across the state  and gives off a distinctive and very pleasant incense  smell. Often piñon wood is the fuel of choice in  chimineas.  In recent years many piñon pines have died because  of drying and warming conditions which have made  them more vulnerable to bark beetles. Piñon tree loss  has also resulted in a rapid decline in the numbers of pin- yon jays. Global warming will only make recovery of  both more difficult.      Piñon tree pine nuts.

By Bob Bower, ACC Member     We may have a mild winter this year, but who knows?  It’s always helpful around this time of the year to  remind you of ways to protect your water pipes from  the effects of very cold weather. Most of the local  experts on this subject generally agree that steps need  to be taken to protect water pipes if temperatures are  expected to drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit. A  broken water pipe inside your home can cause a lot of  extensive and expensive damage!  Let’s start with the outside of your home.  Disconnecting water hoses and protecting outdoor  water faucets is very important. Water that freezes in  outdoor hoses connected to faucets causes a buildup  of pressure on interior plumbing that can result in a  rupture of the interior pipes if the pressure is too high.  Damage to these interior pipes near an outdoor water  faucet is often difficult to repair due to the  inaccessibility of these pipes. Disconnecting hoses  from outdoor faucets and protecting the faucets with  hard-foam insulating cups are good ways to reduce the  chances of damage to these water pipes that extend  through your exterior walls. These inexpensive foam  cups can be purchased at home improvement or  hardware stores and are easy to install. I’ve also found  that it is wise to wrap outdoor faucets with some  insulation prior to placing the foam cup over the  faucets, particularly if any of the faucets are located on  the north side of your home or are located in an area  that does not receive any winter sun. Also, if you have  any water pipes that are located outside your home  that are exposed to the outside temperatures, you  should consider using insulating tubes or heat tape  around these exposed pipes.   Now, let’s consider the inside of your home. If  Albuquerque experiences a spell of extremely cold  weather where temperatures, particularly at night,  drop below the 21°F “benchmark,” leave the water  supply line on at a very slow drip rate somewhere  inside your home. Water in slow motion in a pipe is  much less likely to freeze than water that is motionless.  A faucet located far away from where the water enters  your home is the one that you should use for this  purpose. The cost of water used is insignificant  compared to the cost of repairing damage caused by a  broken water line inside your home. Normally, these  very cold spells don’t last long, so leaving an indoor  faucet dripping for a few days and nights should get  you through until warmer temperatures return. If you  are away from your home during the cold season, make  sure that there is adequate heat inside your home to  prevent internal pipes from freezing. Even when trying  to save energy costs, don’t turn the heat down too  far—experts recommend no lower than 55°F—and  don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you have all of  the water lines properly drained. Believe me, I have  seen the damage caused by pipes that have not been  properly drained and have subsequently burst inside a  home where the heat had been turned off. It’s not a  pretty sight!  One final note for those of you who have swamp  coolers. If you have not already done so, be sure to  drain the water reservoir and disconnect and drain the  water supply line. It doesn’t take much of a freeze to  damage these cooler components. And don’t forget to  wrap or cup any swamp cooler faucets.   Have a great winter!!          12   The GRIT – November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11  Monthly Fun Fact    The KiMo Theater is a National Historic Landmark lo- cated downtown on Central Avenue and Fifth Street’s  northeast corner. It was built in 1927 in the Pueblo Deco  style. It is one of only a few theaters in the United States  that still features its original Wurlitzer organ. Recently  reopened after a 2-year-long renovation, the KiMo hosts  many concerts and performances each year.  Slated for the wrecking ball, the KiMo was saved in  1977 when the citizens of Albuquerque voted to pur- chase the beautiful building.  Many people remark on the swastikas prominent in  the KiMo. Although since the Nazis began using the sym- bol, the swastika evokes negative emotions, one should  remember that the original meaning of this ancient sa- cred symbol is one of life and prosperity. One of the old- est symbols made by humans, the swastika can be found  in 6,000 year-old rock and cave paintings. The swastika  is an important symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism,  among others, and was also used in Native American  and Jewish faiths prior to World War II. It was a widely  used  Native  American  sym- bol,  used  by  many  south- western tribes,  most  notably  the  Navajo.  Among different  tribes the swas- tika carried vari- ous  meanings.  To the Hopi it represented the wandering Hopi clans; to  the Navajo it was a whirling log (tsil no'oli'), a sacred im- age representing a legend and used in healing rituals.      The recently renovated KiMo Theater in downtown Albuquerque            Interior of the KiMo Theater    And the KiMo is said to be haunted! From Legends in  America: “No institution stands through time without  something bad happening, and the KiMo is no  exception. In 1951, a six-year-old boy named Bobby  Darnall was killed when the boiler in the basement  exploded, demolishing part of the original lobby. The  boiler was located right beneath the concession stand in  the lobby. Bobby, who had been sitting in the theater  balcony with some of his friends, suddenly was  frightened by something on the screen and ran down  the staircase to the lobby. Just as he arrived, the boiler  exploded, taking Bobby and part of the lobby in its wake  of destruction. The spirit of little Bobby is said to  continue to haunt the KiMo Theatre today. Often seen  playing on the lobby staircase, Bobby wears a striped  shirt and blue jeans. According to legend, the playful  spirit causes the performers problems by tripping them  and creating a ruckus during performances. To appease  the spirit, the cast hangs doughnuts on the water pipe  that runs along the theatre’s back wall behind the stage.  Often, the treats are gone the next morning. Of those  left, bite marks made by a little mouth can sometimes  be seen. One year, a crew preparing for a Christmas  production took down the stale doughnuts. Big mistake.  No sooner were the doughnuts removed when the  technical rehearsal started to become a disaster, with  everything going wrong, from lighting to sound  problems and more. When the treats were replaced,  things began to run smoothly again.  “Also a mysterious lady is sometimes seen. This  unknown woman, wearing a bonnet, is often reported  walking down the theater halls, appearing to be just  going about her business. Nothing more is known of this  ghostly presence, but seemingly she doesn’t disturb  anyone; she just likes strolling about the old theater.”    Detail of KiMo decorations  13 The GRIT – November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11 14   The GRIT – November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11    Our Beautiful Sandia Mountains    Looking Up    Wikipedia photo    Looking Down    Photo by Donna H.  15   The GRIT – November 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 11  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
