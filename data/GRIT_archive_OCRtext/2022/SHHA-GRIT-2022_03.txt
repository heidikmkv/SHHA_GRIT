Question and Answer Session Ended 2022 Annual Meeting Reports of Officers  President: Roger Hagengruber  I was elected president of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  at the December 9, 2020, Board meeting and took office after the 2021 An- nual Meeting. It has been an honor to serve this past year and to be voted  by the SHHA Board to serve one additional year.   SHHA has some 1800 members and comprises over 2400 properties.  There are 38 units, each with separate covenants, and that number will  change from time to time as new developments seek to join SHHA as a unit.  We have two full-time employees that staff our offices at San Rafael and  Tramway.  Continued on page 2…  2   The GRIT – March – Volume 38 – No. 3  … continued from front page  Our Board of Directors meets monthly, and the vari- ous committees meet separately, approximately  monthly, as well. Two of our committees—Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) and the Architectural Control  Committee (ACC)—are especially busy approving plans  submitted by owners (the ACC) and enforcing the cove- nants (the CSC). It is difficult to give proper appreciation  to the chairs and members of all our committees and es- pecially the ACC and CSC where so many volunteers give  so much of their time. We all owe them our gratitude.   The SHHA Board is anxious to add new members, so  if you have an interest in joining the Board, please let a  Board member or the office know.  Yearly notes:  • We are in good shape financially with all bills paid on  time, adequate insurance and banking arrange- ments, and a sound reserve against contingencies.  Thanks go to our treasurer, Randy Tripp.  • We hired a new employee, Teresa Gonzales, to re- place Jennifer Craft, who relocated. Teresa is a home- owner and member of SHHA. She joined Betsy Rodri- guez in our office. Betsy has been with SHHA for 14  years come April and is our “rock.”  • Our committees handled hundreds of approvals for  property modifications and many covenant issues,  some involving our SHHA attorney. A large workload  and a notable accomplishment.  • Our SHHA dues will increase modestly—by 50¢ from  $8.50 to $9.00—this coming year, which has been  very difficult with rising prices, inflation, and the  need to be cautious in the face of the Covid pan- demic. Still, our dues are very low in comparison to  other homeowner’s organizations.    We are presenting some modest modifications to  our bylaws and seek your approval. The process of re- viewing the bylaws began more than a year ago led by  the past president. At the time, it was clear to Board  members and Officers that the bylaws needed to be  amended to correct a few items and to bring them up  to date. The Executive Committee and the entire Board  were given an opportunity to review the proposed by- laws and to offer changes. The document presented to  the Annual Meeting represents the consensus view of  the SHHA Board. We see benefits and no contentious  issues, and its approval is recommended to the mem- bership of SHHA.  Vice President: Susan McCasland  I was elected for a second term as Vice President of the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association at the Decem- ber 9, 2020, Board meeting. It has been an honor to serve  this past year. I am not seeking a waiver to serve a third  term and will be handing this Executive Officer position  over to a worthy successor at the end of this meeting.  • Served as Vice President for duration of the one-year  term. Second year as VP.  • Performed the following functions in accordance  with the Bylaws:  o Acted on behalf of President when President was  not available.   o Set up Executive Committee Zoom meetings, in- cluding agendas and virtual meeting links    Nominating Committee  Members:  Susan McCasland, Chair   Martin Kirk  Dale Arendt  • Screened Board members to select a slate for 2022  Executive Committee.  • Interviewed and brought 2 new members through  the nominating process and onto the Board.  • Interviewed 2 potential new Board members and  am presenting them at the 2022 Annual Meeting  for election to the Board.  • Reviewed and amended the Nominating Commit- tee charter to specify voting procedures in virtual  meetings    Secretary: Martin Kirk  I was elected Secretary of the Sandia Heights Homeown- ers Association at the December 9, 2020, Board meeting  and took office after the 2021 Annual Meeting. It has  been an honor to serve this past year and to be voted by  the SHHA Board to serve one additional year.  • As Secretary, I serve on the Executive Committee,  which meets on the 1st Wednesday of every month.   • As Secretary, I work with the Communications (GRIT)  Committee to approve GRIT contents.   • Performed the following functions in accordance  with the By-Laws.  o Oversaw the preparation and approval of the  Board meeting minutes.  o Certified the presence of a quorum necessary for  the proper conduct of business at each Board  meeting.

Treasurer: Randy Tripp    Finance Committee   Members:  Randy Tripp, Chair  Carnie Abajian  Fenton McCarthy  Tracey Goodrich  Jim Stewart    2021 Budget Results  The Board approved 2021 Budget estimated Gross In- come of $221,157.73. Expenses of $219,783.29 and Other  Expenses of $930.00, resulting in a Net Income of  $444.44.  As stated at the time the 2021 Budget was approved,  these are projections which may change during the year  and indeed they have changed. The final financial re- ports show a Gross Income of $229,555.85, Expenses of  $222,754.78 and Other Expenses of $1,926.54, resulting  in a Net Income of $4,874.53. The Major diﬀerences be- tween budgeted and actual amounts were the purchase  of only four tram tickets per day for 2021 and legal ex- penses. In addition, all Committee Chairs effectively  managed their budgets which resulted in cost savings.    2022 Budget  After reviewing the proposed budget at its Novem- ber 10, 2021, meeting, the Board approved the budget  as proposed by the Finance Committee. The Finance  Committee developed the budget based on the current  and projected reserves and the revenues needed to  cover the services needed by the property owners.  This allows for a reasonable target Net Income of  $10,612.32.  Each year the income and expenses will be reviewed  to establish the best course of actions for the following  year.  Budgets are projections which may change as the  year progresses—you may go to the Finance tab on the  Board section of the SHHA website for current details.  There is an ongoing attentiveness to possible labor  and financial expense conservation. When evident,  these items will be brought to the attention of the Ex- ecutive Committee and Board for consideration.    Internal Reviews  Each year members of the Finance Committee review  the major financial procedures to ensure they are being  followed.  This past year members reviewed payroll, Quick- books, dues, petty cash, advertising, Tram passes,  health insurance, and security with no aberrant find- ings. Recommendations have been made to the Board,  when warranted.  Based on the reviews, the required annual report was  prepared and submitted to the Executive Committee  for review and acceptance by the President.    A spreadsheet for Actual Expenses vs. Budget is on  page 11, and a Balance Sheet is on page 12.    2022 Annual Meeting Reports   of Standing Committees    Architectural Control Committee (ACC)  Members:  David Crossley, Chair  Robert Bower  Richard Brackett  Tracey Goodrich  Robert Hare    Michael Pierce  Hugh Prather  Randy Tripp    Functions:  • Chartered by covenants for all SHHA Units  • Manages the architectural control process for SHHA  by approving changes to the external appearance of  properties  • Conducts neighborhood reviews, if needed  • Strives to make decisions within 30 days of receipt of  completed applications  • Processes and manages about 300 projects annually  • Meets monthly on 1st and 3rd Wednesdays to expedite  response times  • Administratively approves projects where review by  entire ACC is deemed unnecessary by the Chair  • Publishes guidelines to assist residents with the de- sign process  Continued on page 7…  4   The GRIT March 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 3  JANUARY CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

The CSC  works with property owners to enforce these legally  binding documents. CSC provides covenant enforce- ment through a formalized process.  Many of the covenants were written in the 1960– 1970 timeframes and do not specifically address some  of the key issues we face today. For some complaints,  the unit covenants do not cover or address the alleged  violation and there is nothing the CSC can do to help.  We are bound by what your covenants permit. Only the  homeowners in a specific unit can change their cove- nants. The SHHA webpage offers guidance on how to  change your unit covenants.  In some situations, the Bernalillo County zoning  Codes and Ordinances are more restrictive than the  SHHA covenants, such as for outdoor lighting, barking  dogs, and trash. In these instances, we encourage the  homeowner to file a complaint with the County. The  SHHA office staff can offer guidance on contacting the  County.  The CSC meets the first Tuesday of every month at  6:00 PM in the office conference room. Due to COVID-19,  most CSC meetings this past year have been conducted  via Zoom. If you plan to attend a meeting, we request  that you notify the office 24 hours ahead of time and  give your subject matter. Homeowners with questions  or a statement to make to the Committee are allotted  five minutes at the beginning of each meeting. Then the  meeting goes into Executive Session to maintain the  confidentiality of CSC business. With a Zoom meeting,  the homeowner will be signed out of the meeting be- fore going into Executive Session. The CSC Agenda and  Minutes are for internal distribution only.  Summary of Activities for 2021:  There were fifty-two complaints handled by the CSC  in 2021, including eleven carried over from 2020.  This compares to fifty-seven over the previous year.  All were investigated  by  CSC  members  and  recommendations were made as to the validity of the  complaints with re-gard to the covenants in their  particular units. Of these, forty-two were closed in  2021. Several complaints in 2021 required legal  actions by the SHHA attorney.  2021 Successes:  As was the case in 2020, most CSC meetings in  2021 were held virtually via Zoom. Due to COVID-19,  Commit-tee members did not make in-person contact  with  com-plainants  or  suspected  violators,  alternatively all com-munication was by phone or  email. This required signif-icantly additional effort by  the CSC members. However, in these COVID-19 times,  all complaints filed with the SHHA office and  handled by the CSC were thoroughly investigated and  resolutions negotiated.  The Multi-year Strategic Plan was adopted by the  Board in February 2020 and presented to the  homeown-ers at the 2020 Annual Meeting. The plan  placed addi-tional emphasis on the SHHA dual Mission  Statements – preservation of property values and  maintenance of the  Continued on page 15… 15   The GRIT – March 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 3  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
