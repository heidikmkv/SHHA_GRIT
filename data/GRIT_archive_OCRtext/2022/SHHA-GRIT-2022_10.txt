By Dale Arendt, Vice President and Chair, Nominating Committee    SHHA still needs directors before the rapidly approaching end of 2022! Sev- eral Directors’ terms expire in February, and we need you to step forward  soon. According to our Bylaws, we must have a minimum of 11 in order to  transact business. With the upcoming expirations, we would fall below that  number without new Board members. We invite you, our SHHA members,  to join our Board. Terms are three years, renewable once. Eligibility require- ments are:  • You must be a property owner in Sandia Heights.  • You must be a member of SHHA with paid, up-to-date dues.  • You must be both willing and able to serve and to uphold the Bylaws.  The Board meets at 6:30 PM on the second Wednesday of every month,  except February. Depending on current Covid conditions, meetings may be  in person at the SHHA office or via the Zoom virtual meeting app. Service  on the Board is a great way to meet your fellow homeowners, get involved  with projects, and contribute to the management and well-being of our  wonderful community.   If you’d like to attend a Board meeting, please contact the Office at least  a day in advance. If you wish to join the Board, fill out a Statement of Inter- est (download under the Board tab on our website or obtain from the Of- fice), and submit it to the Office. You’ll hear from us promptly. Thank you  from the Board!    New GRIT Editor  Susan McCasland, GRIT editor    It could be you! Do you like to write, do page layout, edit others’ writings?  Then here’s the job for you. I have been editing The GRIT for five years and  it’s time for someone else’s voice to be heard. If you’re an experienced  newsletter editor, you can take the reins soon. If you would like some on- the-job training for several months that, too, can happen. The ideal candi- date is a good writer, knows English grammar well, can do page layout in  MS Word or another app, meets deadlines. You must be an SHHA member.  You don’t need to be on the Board, though it helps. You do need to be on  the Communications and Publications Committee, though you do not need  to be the chairperson (though that helps, too). It’s a fun job! And you really  get to know what’s going on in Sandia Heights and what your neighbors are  thinking. If you have an interest in being editor or would like to simply dis- cuss the possibility, let the office know.  2   The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10  Continued on page 3…  Short-Term Rentals, eg. Airbnb  Kathleen McCaughey, Covenant Support Committee    Is there an Airbnb operating in your neighborhood? Is some- one in your neighborhood doing a short-term rental of their  entire home, or a room(s) in their home?  Across all units in Sandia Heights, the covenants state,  “No room or rooms in any residence may be rented or leased  to any person, providing, however, that nothing contained  herein shall be construed as preventing the renting or leasing  of an entire lot together with its improvements as a single  unit to a single family.” In short, no short-term rental of a  room, or rooms, is allowed. This language allows short-term  rentals of an entire home.  However, some covenants state, “No room or rooms in  any residence may be rented or leased to any person, provid- ing, however, that nothing contained herein shall be con- strued as preventing the renting or leasing of an entire lot,  together with its improvements, as a single unit to a single  family, for no less than six (6) months.” These neighborhood  units do not allow any short-term rentals.  Short-term rentals can be a nuisance causing extra traffic,  noise, and strangers in your neighborhood. Adequate or  standard screening does not happen on short-term rentals,  and relies mostly on on-line reviews. This could be a problem  on who or how many people show up. A recent Sandia  Heights property was purchased for the sole purpose of con- verting it and using it solely as a short-term rental. Although  short-term rentals can be profitable for the owner of that  property, it most likely will not be profitable for a neighbor  trying to sell their home. In general, we can say too many  short-term rentals will decrease property values in Sandia  Heights and change the character and quality of life that we  so value.  What can you do? Formal complaints can be made  through the Covenants Support Committee regarding issues  with short-term rentals. Currently, we are filing court actions  on two homes in violation of the covenants. Also, you and  your neighbors can add a clause to your unit’s covenants to  disallow short-term, Airbnb-type rentals, e.g., forbid rentals  of less than 6 months. Changing unit covenants can only be  done unit by unit by the residents of the unit. If you need help  with this, call the SHHA office.    Household Radon Awareness  Stan Davis, Covenant Support Committee    Bottom line up front: (1) Radon is a potential health problem  in Sandia Heights; (2) The level of radon in a house can be  observed with radon detectors; (3) Radon levels generally in- crease with closed doors and windows, and during periods  of low atmospheric pressure or rapidly dropping pressure;  and (4) In the example shown here, radon levels were on av- erage higher during spring months compared to summer  months.   Radon is a potentially harmful, carcinogenic gas that is  both colorless and odorless. In Sandia Heights, the source of  radon is the radioactive decay of small quantities of uranium  present in the Sandia granite bedrock and the gravels and  soils derived from it. Radon can rise through microcracks in  concrete foundations and enter our houses, mixing with in- door air. Further radon decay produces alpha particles—the  main source of health risks to lung tissue.   Active and passive radon mitigation systems can be in- stalled to lower indoor radon to “acceptable” levels. I’ll pro- vide mitigation details in a future article.   According to the EPA, exposure to radon gas can cause  lung cancer, even in non-smokers. Generally, the leading  causes of lung cancer are smoking, followed by exposure to  radon, followed by exposure to secondhand smoke. All these  risks are estimated over a person’s lifetime; in the case of ra- don, a lifetime of exposure to radon at a certain level.  The long-term average of household radon is generally a  function of the local geology and of how a house is con- structed. In Sandia Heights, proximity to shallow granite bed- rock and granite-derived gravels and soils, as well as the arid  environment, tend to increase the levels. Many of our houses  rest on concrete slabs that have foundations or stem walls  around their perimeters and often along junctions where  floor levels change. Soil radon gas can rise underneath the  slab and then permeate into the house through numerous  micro-cracks within the concrete. For houses with crawl  spaces, if these are well ventilated the radon risk is reduced.  Houses with swamp coolers should have low radon during  months when the coolers are used and windows are open.  Numerous organizations quote the EPA’s value of 4 pico- curies per liter of air (pCi/L) as the threshold above which a  radon level is unsafe. This value is “fuzzy.” It is for an annual  average for main floor measurements. No amount of radon  exposure is considered safe, and the threshold of 4 pCi/L is  based not just on medical statistics but also on practical and  cost considerations. An individual’s regard for this threshold  relates to risk perception and tolerance.   The level of household radon is quite sensitive to baro- metric pressure. My understanding is that when barometric  pressure decreases rapidly, pressure within the soils and  gravels of the “compartment” below the house slab and be- tween stem walls decreases less rapidly. Because houses— even “air-tight” ones—are generally not “pressure-tight,” a  decrease in indoor pressure tends to keep pace with the de- crease in outside pressure as doors are opened and closed as  we come and go from the house. This situation establishes a  pressure differential, where pressure below the slab remains  a little higher for a while than the indoor air pressure. This  causes air to flow up through the foundation and into the  house, and along with the air comes radon gas. The opposite  occurs when barometric pressure increases: indoor pressure  tends to keep pace, but changes in sub-slab pressure lag, so  indoor air pressure is higher than sub-slab pressure and air  flows back into the sub-slab “compartment.”   …continued from page 2  3   The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10  Continued on page 7…  Below is a graph of indoor radon (for my house) and  outdoor barometric pressure (for Kirtland AFB) rec- orded from March–August this year. The radon line is  the lower serrated one (blue in The GRIT online), and  shows the average for three widely separated rooms in  the house measured using RadonEye brand RD200-style  radon detectors. It is important to note that three con- ventional active radon mitigation systems had already  been installed exterior to the house in, again, widely  separated areas, prior to this period. The pressure line  is the upper serrated one (black). Note that a horizontal  (yellow) line is drawn at the threshold of 4 pCi/L.    Several observations can be made from this graph,  notably how differences in pressure and radon behavior  are observed between the spring and summer months.  (1) At this scale, pressure and radon variations do not  appear to be smooth, but have a serrated pattern, like  teeth of a comb. (2) Barometric pressure shows, gener- ally, large and longer-duration pressure swings and  spikes as well as lower values in the winter compared to  those in the summer. (3) Generally, radon values stay  below 4 pCi/L, except for large swings and spikes that  appear to coincide with pressure.   The next graph zooms into details for March—one of  the less benign months. Here barometric pressure is the  dashed black line, while indoor radon measured in three  widely separated rooms are different colors (green, red,  orange). Also shown in cyan are line segments along the  bottom axis that indicate intervals of about 2–4+ hours  when screen doors and windows were open.   Some key observations from this graph: (1) The ser- rated pattern of spikes seen in the above figure turn out  to be diurnal variations in both barometric pressure and  radon levels; (2) The spike patterns are superimposed  on longer-period variations on the order of roughly 2–6  days; (3) There is an anti-correlation between pressure  and radon: when pressure is high radon tends to be low  and vice-versa; (4) Sudden changes in pressure are as- sociated with sudden changes in radon; (5) When doors    and windows are open, radon levels plummet within  about a couple hours, sometimes approaching zero, re- gardless of how high they were initially; however, when  windows and doors are then closed, radon levels rise  quickly to prior values, again within a couple hours; and  (6) Radon levels in the these rooms are correlated in  that they track each other; however, systematic, and  significant differences can be observed between them:  room “1” tends to have the highest levels, followed by  room “3” and then “2,” regardless of barometric pres- sure. This is clearest during low pressure periods.  The rapid rate at which household radon decreased  upon opening windows and doors was surprising as  there was no gale blowing through the house. And the  rapid rate at which radon increased upon closing win- dows and doors was even more surprising. This bodes  well for people who like to have their windows open,  though opening windows may not always be practical.   Although my house is one story, these three rooms  are in different portions of the house and on slightly dif- ferent levels; presumably there are stem walls isolating  the sub-slab regions. Given time and steady barometric  pressure, these radon levels might equilibrate as inte- rior air circulates through the house, but that is never  actually observed, perhaps because barometric pres- sure is changing enough to stay ahead of equilibrium.  I’m surprised by how high above threshold the peak  values can go—primarily during low-pressure events,  and especially during the sudden onset of low pressure.  The month-long radon averages for rooms 1, 2 and 3 are  4.5, 2.7 and 3.6 in March, and 2.7, 2.0 and 2.6 in August,  respectively. Median values are lower still. So, despite  the spikes, the averages are mostly below threshold,  and were lower in summer than spring. Historical data  for the house (not shown here) showed that installing  radon mitigation systems—in this case, three of them— not only significantly lowered the peak values, but also  lowered the 1–3 month average values from well above   4   The GRIT October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10  AUGUST CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

When radon is measured as  part of home inspections for real estate transactions,  tests are usually only short-term on the order of 2–3  days. My understanding is that attempts might be made  to try to conduct these tests so as to avoid periods of  low pressure, or at least the onset of low pressure.  Some websites recommend this approach in order to  obtain “fair” readings. Regardless, short-term tests may  not be truly representative of the average radon level in  your home because low-pressure events concurrent  with short-term testing could introduce a bias toward  higher average radon readings. Note that the behaviors  shown here may not be typical ones, or representative  of behavior in your house. If you are unsure how your  household radon behaves, detectors are relatively ac- cessible and easy to use to start assessing your situa- tion. Once you have data, you may be better informed  as to whether you should pursue mitigation.

Architectural Observations 3: On Color  By Eric Haskins, architect & resident    Well, I’m gonna paint my picture,  Paint myself in blue, red, black and gray.  All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful.    Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color.  I felt so symbolic yesterday.  If I knew Picasso, I would buy myself a gray guitar and play.  Counting Crows, “Mr. Jones”  Gray has been having an extended moment. You’ve probably  noticed. From Tramway to the West Side, apartment com- plexes, houses, strip malls (including the one that houses our  SHHA), the Panda Express, and even a lot of cars have re- cently received gray paint jobs. Far beyond the borders of  our city, gray has crept across the built landscapes of the  planet. It’s been the global “it” color for a decade, at least.  Those who write about these things believe that gray ap- peals to our desire for solidity in turbulent, trying times. Sur- rounding ourselves with the color of rock and concrete im- plies that we are serious minded people, resolute in the face  of rapid, destabilizing change.  Those same people have also recently predicted that per- haps, just perhaps, gray has run its course. Those cool neu- trals have become oppressive, and we’re jonesing to shrug  off our pandemic depression and begin a return to warmer  shades. For us here in the West, perhaps we’ve just seen too  many burned forests to find comfort in the color of ash. As  for me living here in Albuquerque, I’ll be happy to wave good- bye to cool gray. It doesn’t look good in our warm-toned,  high-desert light. Let them keep it in Halifax or Cleveland,  places that are naturally cold and gray.  Color trends come and go, and leave traces of themselves  on our environment. Perhaps you remember the 70s here,  with “Navajo White” (ivory) stucco, dark-brown wood, or- ange shag carpet, and green refrigerators. The 80s gave us  bright white, pink, and blue buildings. The 90s moved us to  shades of ochre and olive. The early 2000s gave us a variety  of calm earth tones, before the 2010s took us into the  gray/greige zone. Judging by what you see around town,  we’re still in the grip of gray, with white at one end of the  desaturated, non-o-chrome spectrum and black at the other.  Although I admit I’m not immune to color trends, I find  the idea of keeping up with them to be irritating, exhausting,  and potentially expensive. If I can choose and use colors that  are timeless, not trendy, I spend less time repainting or living  in the dated house of the future.  For this reason, among many others, I’m glad to live in  Sandia Heights. Most buildings in Sandia Heights are brown,     8   The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  48 Rock Ridge Drive – Remodel Existing Swimming Pool  51 Rock Ridge Drive – Re-stucco  146 Whitetail Drive – Landscaping   155 Juniper Hill Road – Replacing 1 Pinon Tree and 1 Olive  Tree with 2 Pinion Trees  161 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof   330 Paintbrush Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  358 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Re-stucco   378 Juniper Hill Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  404 Live Oak Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation   438 Live Oak Loop – Wooden Pergola Installation   438 Live Oak Loop – Gazebo/Pavilion Installation   508 Black Bear Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  619 Cedar Hill Road – Landscaping  621 Cedar Hill Road - Reroof  726-6 Tramway Vista Drive – Roof Mounted Photovol- taic Panels Installation   1019 Tramway Lane – Pony Wall Installation for the Roof  Mounted Photovoltaic Panels   1027 Tramway Lane – Deck Shade Structure Installation   1141 Marigold Drive – Replace Wooden Fence   1501 Eagle Ridge Road – Replace Front Door and Refin- ish/Reseal Decking   1547 Eagle Ridge Road – Roof Repair   1841 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Railroad Ties Re- taining Wall  1866 Tramway Terrace Loop – Roof and Stucco Repairs  1924 Quail Run Drive – Replace Siding with Stone Veneer  Siding  2036 Quail Run Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  2440 Tramway Terrace Court – Landscaping   2755 cliffrose Drive – Repaint Stucco on House and  Walls and Replace Fencing   2878 Brushwood Street – Install New Front Entry Gate  and Replace Side Yard Gate   2883 Tramway Place – Block Walls Installation  7712 Cedar Canyon Place – Repair and Re-stucco Exterior  House and Walls  8209 Indigo Court – Reroof        Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

Brown is the timeless color of New  Mexico’s architecture. The reason is simple: early  buildings were made from adobe and plastered on the  outside with mud. They rose seamlessly up from the  ground, and they looked just like the ground, because  building and ground were the same substance.  When  we  New  Mexicans  eventually  began  plastering our buildings with cement stucco, it was  natural that we would color them brown, to harmonize  with the earth and with hundreds of years of  architectural tradition. Throughout the years and  trends, brown is the through-line. Brown looks right in  our clear, warm light. When a client asks me what color  their building should be, I usually pick some shade of  brown, because it fits in with the landscape and looks  lovely.  Now, if we can agree that brown is beautiful, which  brown should it be? Within the brown range, there are  so many options! The answer, of course, is that it  depends upon the effect you want your house to  communicate. Do you want it to stand out, fit in, or  somewhere in between?  If you want your house to stand out against the  hillside, pick a lighter color. I’m personally not a  follower of this approach, because light colors can be  too bright, appearing stark and blinding during our  sunny days. I recognize that many folks prefer light  colors, though, and if that’s the way you want to go,  then I’d recommend you pull your color palette from  the colors of dried native grasses that dominate the  area. A “straw” color will harmonize with the  environment without looking foreign like pure white  would.  If you want your house to fit in, rather than stand  out, there’s a couple of ways you can go. My favorite  approach is to match the color of the soil right under  the house. You can dig up some of the native dirt (not  garden dirt that’s been amended and enhanced), make  a mud pie, and let it dry in the sun for a couple days.  Once it’s dry, that’s the color to use. Your house will  look like it’s part of the ground, perfectly suited for its  location.  Here in Sandia Heights, we also have big, beautiful  boulders. If the color of dried dirt looks too much like  dirt for you, you can try to match the color of the  boulders. It’s a bit harder to do, because boulders  contain many colors, but if you squint and blur your  eyes, the general effect is a kind of a warm taupe,  grayer than the dirt but less gray than concrete. This is  a very satisfying color, and several houses around here  have gone this route, to great effect.  I wouldn’t recommend some of the darker, oranger  browns for this neighborhood. Although dark brown  can be perfect for a house in the North Valley, where  the soil is rich and dark, it doesn’t work as well here,  where the soil is paler decomposed granite.  So, there you have it, a loose philosophy of house  coloration. What about the trim? In general, trim  should contrast with the base color, but stay in the  same family. If your house is medium brown, then your  trim will look good as dark brown or bronze. White trim  has a classic look, and depending on your house’s  architecture, can either look fantastic or too bright. If  you have a Territorial-style house, white will be perfect.  If you have a Pueblo Revival house, white will look  wrong, and you should stick with dark brown. With few  exceptions (usually made for modernist architecture),  trying to match your trim to your walls is not generally  a satisfying approach. It makes the house look  undefined and mealy-mouthed.  Finally, a few words about bright colors on the  exterior: please show restraint. We live in a very visually  sensitive area, dominated by mountains and nature,  and if you stucco your house orange, it’s just not going  to look graceful. Please keep the bright colors inside,  on the paintings in your great art collection, on the  clothes you wear, or on the cars parked discreetly in  your garage.  As always, thanks for your thoughtful attention.  Next time we’ll talk about gravel.  [Ed. Any change to the exterior of your house or  property needs to first be approved by the  Architectural Control Committee. They are unlikely to  approve white or bright colors unless it is for a very  small accent.]  12   The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10  Continued on page 14 …  Roadrunner … Curling?  Elizabeth Edgren  Community Service & Membership Chair    The Roadrunner Curling Club (a volunteer, nonprofit  organization offering lessons and recreational  leagues for all ages and skill levels) is a local club that  makes its home right in our midst, at Outpost Ice  Arena. At their Open House on Sept 4th, they wel- comed the public to learn more about the sport by  getting right out onto the ice. The main idea of the  game is simple: earn the most points by sliding pol- ished granite rocks, or stones, closest to the center of  the target area. But accomplishing that requires strat- egy, strength, coordination, and alertness.   Club members enthusiastically—and patiently!— taught visitors to the Open House how to throw a  stone and how to sweep in front of a stone, terminol- ogy, scoring, and safety. I watched for some time  from the sidelines as men, women, and teens made  their first-ever attempts before I worked up the nerve  to give it a go myself. A different kind of movement  than I’m used to, putting all my weight on non-domi- nant leg and arm; bending, stretching, and coordinat- ing my not-so-limber limbs… Not a paragon of flexibil- ity or fitness, I found it tricky; but many others seemed  to get the knack quite readily. Club members James  and Xander kindly worked with me until I had a hand- ful of “successful” throws.  The Roadrunner Club uses Outpost Ice Arena’s two  curling tunnels, located at either end of the arena,  connecting the two large ice rinks, and offers four dif- ferent leagues with new sessions starting several  times throughout the year*. Each league does cost,  and a paying membership is required for involvement  outside of Learn-to-Curl classes and the Instructional  League.  Thursday evenings feature the five-week Instruc- tional League: 30 minutes of off-ice discussion and 90  minutes of on-ice coaching and gameplay. No experi- ence or equipment is required, but it takes a minimum  of six people to make a class.  On Tuesday evenings the No-Standings League  meets: curlers stay on the same team for six weeks  and each team has opportunity to play each other  team. This is a “relaxed, non-competitive” league. No  experience needed beyond a learn-to-curl class.  Saturday mornings belong to the Brunch Club  League, a four-week option where enrolled individu- als draw for team positions each week, play for fun  and friendship, then go out for brunch afterwards.   The Round Robin League plays on Sundays for 8–12  weeks. Teams stay constant for the duration, play  eight games against each other, and may have  playoffs and a championship game if time allows.  As much of a klutz as I was on the ice, I still felt  warmly   welcomed  and   encouraged  by  every   Club                                13 The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10 … continued from page 12  14   The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10  member I met. Read more about the club in this May  2021 ABQ Journal article The Roadrunner Curling Club  is bringing icy fun for the whole family - Albuquerque  Journal (abqjournal.com) And if you would like to sign  up, go to Roadrunner Curling Club - Upcoming events.  Fun facts: An early 16th-century date-inscribed curling  stone was discovered in Scotland, and paintings by a  16th-century Dutch/Flemish artist shows Flemish peas- ants curling. The earliest written reference to curling is  from the Scottish poet Henry Adamson in 1620. It is of- ten called the “roaring” game due to the sound made  by the stone sliding on the “pebbly” textured ice (made  by spraying droplets of water on the ice) from wikipe- dia.org.    *Next start dates are Oct 8th for Brunch Club, October  18th for the No-Standings League, and October 27th for  the Instructional League.    Thank You, Neighbor    Has one of your neighbors done something out of the  ordinary that you would like to acknowledge? Thank  them in The GRIT so the whole community knows  what a great deed they did. Send submissions to  TheGritSHHA@gmail.com and we’ll publish them as  space allows. We need your name and please ask your  neighbor if it is okay to mention their name, otherwise  they’ll need to remain anonymous.   To start off this occasional series we want to thank  Vance Behr for being a good neighbor. There is a va- cant lot—not his—near the top of San Rafael that was  overgrown with tumbleweeds and a source of a tum- bleweed explosion in the neighborhood. Last month,  Vance pulled a pickup bed piled full of tumbleweeds  from that lot and took them to the dump. From all of  us, thank you Vance!      2023 SHHA Residents’ Guide   & Directory Deadline    Please check your alphabetical and numerical listings  in the 2022 Residents’ Guide and Directory.

Monthly Fun Fact    This month’s fun fact is right in our backyard. The San- dia Peak Tramway, aka The Tram, running from our  neighborhood at the base of the Sandia Mountains to  North Sandia Peak, is the longest aerial tramway in  North America, spanning 2.7 miles and taking about 15  minutes to travel the distance. The top of the tram is  at an elevation of 10,378 feet—hence the name of the  new restaurant up there: Ten3. From Sandia Peak,  there is a panoramic view of over 11,000 square miles!           15   The GRIT – October 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 10  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
