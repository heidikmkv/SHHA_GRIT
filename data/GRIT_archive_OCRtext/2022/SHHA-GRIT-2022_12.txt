This time, I have some good news and some not-so-good  news. First, the good news: thanks to the active efforts of your leadership  (and perhaps in part due to my message in the last GRIT), we have 4 can- didates for Board directors and they are eager to serve on committees,  including the Architectural Control and Covenant Support Committees.  Two of the candidates’ biographies are in this issue of The GRIT and the  other two will appear next month. You will be able to vote for them at the  annual meeting in February—more on that on the next page. Our appre- ciation goes out to those responding to our need for Board and commit- tee members since we will lose several current Board members and one  committee chair by the next annual meeting.  We still need more new directors for our Board. Please give it your con- sideration!  Regarding the less-than-good news: after extensive financial review  and consideration of the Board, SHHA will be raising member dues to $15  per month beginning in January. Additionally, passes for the Tram will rise  from $7.50 to $10, which is still a bargain compared to paying at the Tram.   At the current monthly dues rate and even after cutting everywhere  possible, we were headed for a deficit of about $30,ooo—an amount cer- tain to increase each subsequent year. A deficit of this amount is not per- mitted, and financial adjustments became required. SHHA membership  rates are the lowest in our region by a substantial amount. As is happening  everywhere, costs are rising for office expenses, insurance, and legal fees  among other costs. It was our view that it would be best to recognize  these increases and raise our dues to give us some margin so that the dues  would remain stable for some years to come. Adjusting to all our in- creased expenses and preparing for the future, the $15 monthly dues  should allow us to carry forward a modest surplus for the next few years.   Your Board is sorry to have SHHA join with almost everything else in  becoming more expensive, yet we hope you will see your membership  and support as an essential element in sustaining our beautiful Sandia  Heights.       2   The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12  2023 Annual Meeting    The 2023 Sandia Heights Homeowners Association an- nual meeting will be held on Saturday, February 25. It  will be held in-person at the Church of the Good Shep- herd in the ground-floor auditorium. The address is 7834  Tennyson St NE. Stay tuned for a detailed agenda in  next month’s GRIT. One of the agenda items will be elec- tion by the membership of new Board members (see  below), per Bylaws section 6.5, which requires a short  biography of the candidate to be published prior to the  meeting.    Biographies of Director Candidates    Below are biographies of two of the candidates for the  SHHA Board of Directors. We expect to publish two ad- ditional biographies next month. You, the membership,  will be voting at the annual meeting in February on  these candidates to become directors on the SHHA  Board.    Claudia Mitchell  I graduated from the University of California, River- side, with a degree in Biology. I subsequently completed  an internship at the Sacramento Medical Center to be- come a Medical Technologist. My professional employ- ment included 15 years in hospital clinical laboratory  practice and management, and 20 years in medical diag- nostics field sales and marketing. I retired in 2015 to  Whidbey Island in the Puget Sound north of Seattle  where I was involved in numerous volunteer activities  that spanned citizen science, vocal performance, and  art. I studied oil painting and began exhibiting profes- sionally at a local gallery.  After many years in the Pacific Northwest, my part- ner and I were seeking a change for more sun. After  much research we discovered Sandia Heights. We were  fortunate to find a house here and moved in January of  this year. We have been totally immersed in renovating  the house and having a shop added on the back of the  garage. We utilized and appreciated the SHHA re- sources available to us and met some wonderful folks.  My partner, Gerard Del Monte, is a fine-art woodworker  and we are happy to have learned about and joined the  Sandia Heights Artists’ Association. We love and respect  our wild animal visitors and this inspiring environment  in the foothills of the magnificent Sandias. We feel grat- itude every day.  Sandia Heights is a housing development unlike any  other. The covenants that run with the land were  designed to maintain and protect these natural assets  for our esthetic enjoyment now and in the future and to  retain the value of the investment in our homes. I want  to support the continuation of this special place by con- tributing my time, enthusiasm, and fresh perspective to  the Sandia Heights Homeowners’ Association Board.    Arthur Romero  I’ve been a SHHA member since 2004. During my 27- year career repairing operating room equipment, I trav- eled the state, and even many parts of the country,  working in hospitals. Therefore, I’ve seen first-hand  what other residential communities have to offer. San- dia Heights is top tier—one of the best HOAs in the  Southwest. I’ve visited communities and similar neigh- borhoods in Tucson, Santa Fe, Phoenix, Durango. I like  Sandia Heights better! We’re blessed! I love it here! It’s  a beautiful neighborhood. Mountain views, city views,  spectacular world-class sunsets.  Where else can you  see boulders the size of large trucks scattered in front  yards and pine trees over a hundred years old?    What lured me to Sandia Heights were the animals.   Over the past 18 years we have seen bears, cougars,  bobcats, coyotes, squirrels, many species of quail,  hawks, turkey vultures, many other birds, snakes, road- runners, field mice, big rats, spiders of all kinds, and all  the insects you can imagine. Granted, animal sightings  are fewer than 18 years ago. I miss the howling coyotes  we used to hear several nights a week. Now, I hear the  coyotes howling, but only once in a while.  Although it goes without saying, there is always  room for improvement.   I walk a 4-mile loop and have noticed a few dilapi- dated homes: plants, animals, trees, problem weeds,  problem trees. A few of the homes I pass are totally ne- glected, almost like they are vacated. I hate to see  homes like that—it’s disrespectful to their neighbors.  Unattended barking dogs have become a problem.   The once spectacular views are being obstructed by  problem trees: Russian olive, Siberian elm, Chinese elm.   Tumbleweeds and bushes are spilling out into the al- ready narrow streets.   Light pollution is causing wildlife to relocate. Flood  lights, motion sensors, more porch lights, cameras, etc.  are having a negative impact. No wonder the animals  don’t come around anymore.   I’ve decided to volunteer and support the SHHA  team. I want to get involved. I want to make a differ- ence. I’m dedicated to preserving our property values,  the unique environment and quality of life, and protect- ing the wildlife and native vegetation.  3   The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12    Join the Welcome Wagon!  Elizabeth Edgren  Community Service & Membership Committee Chair    The Welcome Wagon term and concept comes from the  covered-wagon era of American westward pioneers,  when some people would provide fresh food and water  for new westward-bound travelers. A clever marketing  man in Memphis, TN, founded an organization with the  name in 1928, hiring friendly women who knew their  neighborhoods to personally deliver gift baskets filled  by local businesses to new neighbors. Eventually, “Wel- come Wagon® became one of the first all-female com- panies in the United States.”   https://welcomewagon.com/history/  We don’t have the official Welcome Wagon® pro- gram, but the SHHA Community Service & Membership  Committee initiated a similarly inspired plan in early  2020—and you know what happened that year. Coast- ing on the momentum those good people started, the  current Committee is trying to personally welcome new  residents in Sandia Heights with a bag containing infor- mation and/or “goodies” from local organizations and  businesses.  I especially enjoyed a Saturday morning in early Sep- tember when I met four new residents in different parts  of Sandia Heights. We traded how-we-got-here stories,  and they asked questions about the neighborhood.  My welcome: the very day our moving truck un- loaded our furniture in Sandia Heights, a neighbor cou- ple stopped by on their dog walk to introduce them- selves and welcome us to the neighborhood. They even  gave us a card with their name, number, and address if  we wanted to call or get together. A few days later, she  came by with a plate of chocolate chip cookies, still  warm. I haven’t been that kind, and these Welcome Bag  visits are usually weeks after the moving truck has left,  but many still appreciate the personal welcome.  Would you like to meet one or two new Sandia  Heights residents per month? Do you know of business  samples or freebies or information to include in our Wel- come Bags?  The SHHA office staff provides us with  names and addresses week by week; we have the sup- ply of bags and contents at the office, usually already  assembled; we head out individually at a time conven- ient to us, and hope to meet new folks face-to-face as  they’re settling in.    Please  call  the  office  or  email  us  at  thegritshha@gmail.com if you’d like to join us on the  Sandia Heights Welcome Wagon!  Bernalillo County Mowing of Our Streets  Our Responsibilities as Homeowners   and Bernalillo County’s Responsibilities  Kathleen McCaughey  Environment & Safety Committee Chair    Well, the weeds got pretty big this year before the  County mowed the vegetation in our set-back area in  late October and November. This was due to issues with  their mower and the availability of parts for repair. We  must remember that we, the homeowners, are liable  for any incidents that may occur because of lack of  maintenance on our part in the set-back area. Here are  some things to keep in mind:  Set-back area. The “set-back area” is that portion of  land along the road between the private property line  and the edge of the paved road or curb. It is within the  public right-of-way and is occupied by utility distribu- tion, road drainage, traffic control, and public functions  such as mailboxes. Each driveway, boulder, tree/shrub,  etc. is a potential traffic conflict or disruption to the  function of the setback.   Homeowner Responsibilities:  • Keep the set-back area clear of all shrubs, trees,  landscaping boulders, weeds, etc. The County can- not publicly maintain private property by State law.  • Clean up the clippings left behind after Bernalillo  County mows.   • Be responsible for the safe passage of pedestrians on  our streets. Many residents complain of excessive ve- hicle speeds and driver inattentiveness in our com- munity. When we do not keep the set-back area  clear, it is difficult for a pedestrian to step off the  road quickly, if needed.  • Maintain unobstructed vision for traffic safety.  Again, strictly and solely to be maintained by the  property owner.  • Be liable for all claims to the County arising from fail- ure in doing any of the above.  Bernalillo County Public Works Responsibilities:  • Bernalillo County will mow the set-back area, up to 7  feet, to protect the edge of the asphalt and assist  with drainage.   The County has a difficult time mowing here as we  have chamisa and volunteer trees (like elms) in the set- back area. They are difficult or impossible to mow.  When the County does mow, they get complaints from  homeowners: clipping something the homeowner  does not want clipped, not cleaning up afterwards,  etc. Remember, they are doing a service for us.  4   The GRIT December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12  OCTOBER CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

The  Save the Elena Gallegos neighborhood group and other  concerned Albuquerqueans held a rally during the “First  Annual” 10-mile Foothill Run put on by Albuquerque  Parks and Recreation Open Space and Bosque Running  Company. Over $6000 cash was awarded to winners.  The rally was a positive experience to communicate to  the neighborhood concerns about the EGOS project. Af- ter the run, the total number of people signing the peti- tion in opposition to the development shot up in num- bers. Signs were put up along Simms Rd, picketers were  at the finish line, and flyers were placed on cars in the  Albertson’s parking lot used for busing participants to  Elena Gallegos. This run was a commercial activity and  Parks and Recreation made close to $18k from entry  fees. The La Luz Run was cancelled in 2019 due to the  fact that commercial activities are not allowed in the  Sandia Mountain Wilderness.  CABQ Parks and Recreation Update. The CABQ hired  a “Communications Coordinator,” Franchesca Perdue,  in September to handle PR for the project. However,  they have not yet held any further public meetings or  dialog. See CABQ Elena Gallegos webpage below for an  updated timeline of the implementation plan.  Save the Elena Gallegos organization. A concerned  group of citizens, primarily residents, residing in both  Sandia Heights and High Desert, hired a real estate law- yer to explore the legality of the proposed develop- ment. See below.  The Save the Elena Gallegos organization is collecting  signatures for a petition in opposition to the CABQ de- velopment plans. To date they have over 6000 signa- tures. They have created a web page with comprehen- sive background information, updates, and events  (www.saveelenagallegos.org). The petition can be ac- cessed here (Petition), or from the webpage. If you  have concerns about the EGOS development plan or  want to be better informed regarding the issues, please  visit their webpage. If you oppose the project, you can  make your voice heard by signing the petition and shar- ing the website and petition with others who support  Elena Gallegos Open Space.   Save the Elena Gallegos has been officially incorpo- rated as a domestic nonprofit allowing for donations to  cover legal fees. The www.saveelenagallegos.org  webpage has a GoFundMe link for donations or go to  https://www.gofundme.com/f/saveelenagallegos.  Background. In January 2022, the City of Albuquer- que (CABQ) announced plans to build a large building  (“Education Center”) in the Elena Gallegos Open Space  (EGOS), at either the Pino Trailhead or the Cottonwood  Springs Trailhead. In addition, this plan calls for substan- tial widening of Simms Road and construction of a park- ing lot in the Pino Arroyo (Tramway and Simms) to ac- commodate increased event traffic and a bus system  from the newly constructed parking lot to the Elena  Gallegos building. Here is the information that the City  has made publicly available on the project.   1.  Dekker/Perich/Sabitini's Feasibility Study   2.  CABQ Elena Gallegos Page   3.  Open Space's official website on the project   From April 27 to June 10, 2022, the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association conducted a survey of Sandia  Heights residents, and over 75% of respondents were  opposed to the City’s plans.   Elena Gallegos History. The Elena Gallegos Open  Space was established in 1982 by Purchase Agreement  and a deed put in place to protect the land with the in- tention that EGOS be preserved in perpetuity as undis- turbed open space. Usage stipulation from the original  Purchase Agreement of EGOS made between the City of  Albuquerque and the Albuquerque Academy in June  1982 states the following:   “5. Limitations on Use of the Park Property. The Park  Property shall be used solely by the City as a City Park. The  City will limit use of the Park Property to passive recrea- tion uses which include only the installation, construc- tion, maintenance and use of picnic benches, tables, shel- ters, barbecue grills, drinking water facilities, associated  minor recreation facilities (such as volley ball or horse- shoe pitching facilities), restrooms, access roads, parking  lots, hiking trails, trail heads, a trailer or other residence  for a residential caretaker, and electric power facilities as- sociated with the specified uses.”      8   The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12    ACC Activity Log          Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  9 Juniper Hill Road – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation  16 Juniper Hill Loop – Replace Garage Door  16 Juniper Hill Loop – Reroof   21 Sandia Heights Drive – Reroof   35 Cedar Hill Place – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation  91 Juniper Hill Road – Storage Unit Installation  146 Whitetail Drive – Hot Tub Installation  147 Whitetail Road – Roof Repair and Replace Skylights  163 Juniper Hill Road – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation   184 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Stucco Repair  211 Spring Creek Place – Roof-Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation  358 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Paint Exterior Furnace Doors  and Garage Doors  527 Live Oak Place – Reroof   532 Roadrunner Lane – Replace Portion of Existing  Driveway  711-32 Tramway Place – Paint Garage Door, Front Door,  Beam, Post, and Trim  720-10 Tramway Lane – Trash/Recycle Bins Enclosure  726-19 Tramway Vista Place – Roof-Mounted Photovol- taic Panels Installation  935 Bobcat Blvd. – Refurbish Existing Driveway with Mi- nor Modifications for Drainage  984 Lynx Loop – Replace Light Fixtures  984 Lynx Loop – Re-stucco  1102 Marigold Drive – Landscaping   1173 Laurel Loop – Enlarge Dining Room  1241 Rockrose Road – Re-stucco  1420 San Rafael Court – Reroof, Installation of Four  Raised Garden Beds and an Enduraplas Water Tank  1522 Eagle Ridge Road – Storage Room Addition and  Miscellaneous Projects  1540 Eagle Ridge Place – Re-Stucco Home/Outside Wall  and Install New Door to Back Yard  1555 Eagle Ridge Road – Re-stucco  1874 San Bernardino Avenue – Reroof   1906 Quail Run Drive – Canale Repair  2724 Tramway Circle – Pergola Installation   2892 Tramway Place – Landscaping   2900 Tramway Place – Reroof   8252 Raintree Drive – Reroof   7716 Cedar Canyon Court – Replace Front and Kitchen  Doors       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

I find the raptors most  interesting, particularly the great horned owls  (GHOW) and red-tailed hawks. Having lived in Sandia  Heights for over 27 years, I remember before the year  2000 I would see a fair number of GHOW out in the  yard during various hours from dusk to dawn. Fast  forward to today, I haven’t seen any in years. I want  to ask you to join me in promoting more of these  beautiful raptors into the area.  To start, I’ve provided several appropriate nests,  with homeowners’ permission, for the owls or hawks  to find and inhabit. A few are shown here. If we’re  fortunate, owls or hawks will discover them this  nesting season. Owls do not build their own nests;  they are squatters. They will take over nests that  other large raptors have built. Raptors have varying  nesting preferences and times, but most nest in the  January–March time frame, and lay eggs in late March  to April.  This is the time we may notice the parents  taking turns nesting and feeding on the surrounding  food sources.       Man-made nest for a great horned owl    Two man-made nests       Man-made nest in a tree    I’ll focus this article on the GHOW, since they are  the early breeders, and the first clutch is usually laid  in late January to February. Eggs are incubated for  30–37 days (5 weeks), then nestlings fledge  approximately 50 days later (~2 months). The GHOW  diet is the widest prey base of any North American  owl and they dine on many animals we consider pests.  Grasshoppers, mice, rats, rabbits, and squirrels are  killed almost instantly with the owl’s talons and foot  pressure. On average, owls can eat up to 12 mice a  night or several rats. Owl wildlife is not particularly  picky, and we can rely on them to keep pest  populations in check as long as humans don’t  interfere by using poisons.  The concern is these beautiful creatures will not  survive  if the wild food source  becomes tainted  with  … continued from page 11  12   The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12    rodenticides or poisons. The birds become infected by  secondary poisoning, meaning eating something that  ate the poison, or from a cumulative buildup in them- selves. Remember, the poison isn’t finished in the rat  and the owl will eat it while alive. These toxic products  cause severe health damage and usually result in  death in non-targeted wildlife. If the owl parents die,  there is less than 25% chance that offspring will survive  even under rehabilitation care. I believe this is why  raptors are no longer seen as often in the Sandia area  as they were in the past.   For information on poisoning, please see any of  these links:  a. https://www.abqjournal.com/1164814/rat-poison- in-prey-threatens-owls-other-animals.html  b.

Audubon Magazine site, Poisons Used to Kill Ro- dents Have Safer Alternatives, “A second genera- tion of ultra-potent rodenticides creates a first-class  crisis for people, pets, and wildlife.”  I urge you to use traps or a more natural approach  to rodent and pest control to eliminate these noctur- nal pests with little to no effort on your part. Who  wouldn’t want to see these impressive creatures nest- ing above?

Great horned owl feeding  Monthly Fun Fact  from The Kiddle Encyclopedia: Albuquerque, NM    Albuquerque was named in honor of Francisco, Duke  of Alburquerque, who was viceroy of New Spain from  1653 to 1660.  The growing vil- lage soon to become  Albuquerque  was  named by provincial  governor  Francisco  Cuervo  y  Valdés.  Francisco’s title re- ferred to the Spanish  town of Alburquer- que, in the Spanish  province of Badajoz,  near Portugal. The  name has two theo- ries of origin which  denote either Latin  or Arabic roots. The first, derived from the Latin albus  quercus meaning “white oak.” This name was proba- bly in reference to the prevalence of cork oaks in the  region, which have a white wood when the bark is re- moved. Alburquerque is still a center of the Spanish  cork industry, and the town coat-of-arms features a  white cork oak. Another theory suggests that it may  come from the Arabic Abu al-Qurq, which means “fa- ther of the cork [oak].”  The first “r” in Alburquerque was later dropped,  probably due to association with the prominent gen- eral Alfonso de Albuquerque, whose family title  (among others), and then name, originated from the  border Spanish town, but used a variant spelling. The  change was also in part due to the fact that citizens  found the original name difficult to pronounce.  Western folklore offers a different explanation,  tracing the name Albuquerque to the Galician word al- baricoque, meaning “apricot.” The apricot was  brought to New Mexico by Spanish settlers, possibly  as early as 1743. As the story goes, the settlement was  established near an apricot tree, and became known  as La Ciudad de Albaricoque. As frontiersmen were  unable to correctly pronounce the Galician word, it be- came corrupted to “Albuquerque.”        Francisco, Duke of Alburquerque  13 The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12 14   The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12  This page contains historical pieces   from the February 1993 GRIT    The View from Jackrabbit Hill  Jean Heflin        A Second Look  There was a time when we thought many of the  world’s problems would be solved by chemicals, ferti- lizers, and pesticides. Now after decades of experi- ence, we are taking a second look at chemicals and re- thinking their use. We fear that to solve some of our  problems, we create others we cannot control.  An exciting “second look” is taking place in our  area to consider the effects and kinds of home land- scape pest management. Funded by the US Depart- ment of Agriculture, New Mexico State University Co- operative Extension Service has implemented a three  year study called Urban Integrated Pest Management  Project (IPM). It will study means of controlling pests  (insects, weeds, disease and others such as snails,  deer, rabbits) without FIRST resorting to toxic chemi- cals. The aim is not to eliminate chemical controls but  to use the least toxic effective means before resorting  to chemicals. Alternative controls range from cultural  and biological to hand picking pests and the use of  less toxic chemicals. This concept has proven very suc- cessful in our national forests and parks and in agricul- tural areas; it should work well in urban areas too.  Headed by Dr. Charles Ward, urban entomologist ,  the project will determine (1) the most serious pest  problems in urban landscape plantings; (2) at what  point does the homeowner decide that action is nec- essary to combat the pest; (3) at what point does the  homeowner believe the plant aesthetics are compro- mised by the pest; (4) what workable and reliable  alternatives to chemical controls for these pests can  be developed; (5) if an Integrated Pest Management  program would be profitable as a commercial busi- ness, provided public demand develops.  The project will identify existing landscape pests in  our area, find out who maintains the landscape, in- cluding pest control, and where the maintainer gets  his (or her) information. Urban Albuquerque land- scapes will be monitored on a weekly basis for 1, 2 or  3 years. Also, an IPM education program will be devel- oped to inform the public about its ability to reduce  toxic chemical applications, reduce soil and water  contamination, and to train individuals in IPM tech- niques.   Probably, the name IPM will be changed in the fu- ture to Plant Health Care as methods are developed  for pest problem prevention through proper horticul- tural practices: Proper site, proper plants, proper  planting and cultivations. If you would like to know  more about the program and, possibly, to participate,  call Susan Wachter at [30-year-0ld phone number].          15   The GRIT – December 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 12  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
