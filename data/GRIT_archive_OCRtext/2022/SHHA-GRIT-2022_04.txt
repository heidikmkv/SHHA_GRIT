Since I’m still new to this  environment, I want advice and inspiration, and re- minders of what I should be doing out there. Should I  plant or prune? How much should I water what, and  when?   SHHA aims to preserve Sandia Heights’ unique natu- ral environment, as well as minimize the risk of devas- tating wildfire. But that does not mean leaving our  space to be overrun with yucca and rabbitbrush (cham- isa), or clear-cutting the whole space around our  homes. How can we maintain and beautify our own  space and our neighborhood?  I found easy access to old NMSU Southwest Yard and  Garden articles at NMSU: Southwest Yard & Garden -  2021. The articles are organized by year and by month,  so I can find information on season-specific topics. For  example, last year’s April articles covered seed-start- ing, hummingbirds, and drought-friendly flowers. For  folks who love the big picture, you can browse pieces  from any season, any year back to 1996.  If you want a lively but water-wise landscape, you  can find inspiration and advice in The Enchanted Xeri- scape: A Guide to Water-wise Landscaping in New Mex- ico Enchanted Xeriscape 04 (state.nm.us). This guide    covers planning and designing, soil preparation, plant  choices, irrigation, mulching, and maintaining a low- water-use landscape.  A local nursery landscaping consultant gave me a  print copy of Xeriscaping: The Complete How-To Guide,  an informative, easy-to-use resource that helped me  figure out how to improve our landscaping. You can  find everything in that magazine plus so much more at  505 Outside | Your resource for beautiful desert  friendly landscapes. (or https://www.505outside.com)   One more thing, if your pruning shears are looking  impatient—A good rule of thumb for pruning flower- ing plants: if it blooms in spring, it blooms on old wood,  so prune once blooms have finished. If it blooms in  summer, it blooms on new wood, so prune in the fall  or very early spring.  Please, if you have favorite, tried-and-true landscap- ing resources, share them with The GRIT readership  through our email at thegritshha@gmail.com.

These activities  are possible in large part because of the light regula- tions of both Bernalillo County and our Sandia Heights  Unit Covenants.  Per the North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia  Heights Light Pollution Ordinance of the Bernalillo  County Code, all exterior light fixtures shall be aimable,  shielded fixtures so that excessive light does not cross  into adjacent properties or point up into the sky, be  equipped with motion sensors or automatic timing de- vices, and remain off between 11:00 PM and sunrise ex- cept for illuminating walkways or driveways. More de- tailed information can be found at:   https://library.municode.com/nm/berna- lillo_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?no- deId=BECOCO_CH30EN_ARTVILIPO_DIV2OULIFI- NOALACSAHEAR  The various Unit Covenants may have different word- ing, but all are trying to accomplish the same purpose:  minimizing the effects of outdoor lighting on one’s  neighbors. Covenant documents for each Unit may be  found at:  http://sandiahomeowners.com/unit-covenants.  When planning new or assessing your current out- door lighting, in addition to consulting the above regu- lations, think about what impact your lighting will have  on your neighbors. Will it shine into their windows or  onto their patio? A little consideration can avoid a com- plaint to the Covenant Support Committee and/or to  Bernalillo County. We have a wonderful, unique neigh- borhood—let’s keep it that way!

SH Tips & Hacks    This month’s hack helps remove those pesky calcium  deposits in your toilets and sinks. It is citric acid. In addi- tion to being in citrus fruit and a commercial food addi- tive, it makes a great cleaner: effective, natural, and en- vironmentally friendly. Your septic bugs will thank you,  too.  Use the powdered form and mix with water or, for  even more zing, with water and bicarbonate of soda. It  is effective on soap scum, calcium deposits, lime, rust  stains, and rust itself. It kills bacteria, mold and mildew,  but not viruses. You can use it as an alternative to  bleach, oven cleaners, dishwasher cleaners, bathroom  cleaners, carpet cleaners, dish soap, laundry detergent,  window cleaners and stain removers. And for replacing  all those harsh cleaners that would normally go into  your septic tank, the bacterial colony living there will  thank you. (Did I mention that already?) If used accord- ing to the manufacturer’s specifications, by the time the  citric acid reaches the septic tank, it’s harmless.  Avoid using citric acid on natural stone or marble  (corrosive), wood floors and furniture (can leave coat- ings looking cloudy), or electronic screens (breaks  down the coating meant to reduce smudges and ex- poses layers meant to be protected). And try to keep it  out of your eyes.    If you have a suggestion for a tip or hack for your  neighbors, send it to TheGRITSHHA@gmail.com. We  will credit you for the suggestion.    8   The GRIT – April 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 4  ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  11 Juniper Hill Loop – Replace HVAC Units  38 Rock Ridge Drive – Re-stucco  54 Rock Point Place – Outdoor Pool Remodel  190 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Swamp with AC  198 Big Horn Ridge – Additions to House  359 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation  518 Black Bear Loop – Relocation of Some Roof Mounted  Photovoltaic Panels  567 Black Bear Road – Woodshop/Studio Addition   754 Tramway Lane – Paint Garage Door   795-C Tramway Lane – Reroof   795-P Tramway Lane – Reroof  808 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  908 Tramway Lane – Resurface Asphalt Driveway   993 Lynx Loop – Stucco Repair and Elastomeric Stucco- Coating  1019 Tramway Lane – RM PV Panels Installation  1155 Laurel Loop – Garage Addition with Sun-Shaded  Deck Structure  1166 Laurel Loop – Replace Stuccoed Maibox   1240 Rockrose Road – Reroof, Re-stucco, Replace Win- dows/Doors and Miscellaneous  1865 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Windows  1949 Quail Run Loop – Replace Outdoor Light Fixtures  2017 Quail Run Drive – Weather Monitoring Device Instal- lation  2305 Calle de Rafael – Reroof   2440 Tramway Terrace Court – Raise Height of Wall  2513 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace Fence with Stuc- coed Block Wall and Miscellaneous  2581 Spring Creek Place – New Construction  2723 Tramway Circle – Reroof and Re-stucco   2725 Tramway Lane – Reroof   2750 Cliffrose Drive – Construction of Block Wall  7732 Cedar Canyon Road – Replace Concrete Courtyard  Slab and Entry Sidewalk  8245 Raintree Drive – Extend Current Block Wall   9100 Lynx Loop – New Stuccoed Block Wall and Court- yard  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.

Sopapilla is a modified form of “sopaipa,” a Spanish  word that came from the Mozarabic language “xopaipa” which means bread soaked in oil.       12   The GRIT – April 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 4    Pets & Covid    We’ve certainly been through a world-wide wringer  the past couple of years. Now here’s something else  to pay attention to with respect to Covid: your pets.  The Covid-19 virus can spread from people to ani- mals during close contact. Pets can become seri- ously ill from a Covid infection. The following symp- toms may be exhibited by pets sick with Covid:  • Fever  • Coughing  • Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  • Lethargy  • Sneezing  • Runny nose  • Eye discharge   • Vomiting  • Diarrhea  How to protect your pet from Covid:  • Limit contact between your pet and people  outside the household as much as possible  • Keep pets indoors, if possible  • Walk dogs on a leash and maintain at least 6  feet from other people and animals  • Avoid crowded dog parks or public places  • Regularly wash food and water dishes, toys,  and bedding  • Cats are particularly susceptible to infection  with Covid—people and pets should avoid  contact with strays  • Create an emergency plan for your pet in case  you get sick with Covid  • Have at least a two-week supply of pet food,  treats, and cat litter  • Have a 30-day supply of pet medication  • Ensure pet medical records are up-to-date, in- cluding microchip and vaccine information  What NOT to do:  • Don’t mask your pets  • Don’t wipe or bathe pets with chemical disin- fectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, hand  sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other in- dustrial or surface cleaners.  If you are sick with Covid:  • Avoid the following forms of contact with  pets: petting, snuggling, kissing, sharing food,  sleeping with  • Wash your hands before and after interacting  with pets and their food, waste, and supplies  • Wear a face mask around your pets  • Avoid sharing food, eating utensils, cups, bed- ding and other items with pets  If your pet becomes sick with Covid:  • Isolate your pet at home, except for medical  care  • Call ahead before taking your pet to the vet- erinary clinic  • Call your veterinarian and ask for a telemedi- cine consultation  • Follow all care instructions provided by your  veterinarian  • Monitor your pet’s symptoms  All information in this article is from Pet News Daily’s  Covid-19 and Pet Health Safety website (https://pet- newsdaily.com/covid-19-and-pet-health-safety/)  which, in turn, uses the following sources: Federal  Emergency Management Agency, World Health Or- ganization, Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion, Food and Drug Administration, and the World  Wildlife Fund.

Obviously after 30 years, the numbers in the  original Editor’s Note have changed, but the mes- sage is still quite relevant for today’s residents.]  Editor’s Note: Septic systems are the primary  method of waste disposal in Sandia Heights. Of the  some 1,600 residences in the community, approxi- mately 1,000 households have a septic tank and drain- field somewhere on their property. If you are in doubt  as to whether you have sewer services or a septic sys- tem, please call Sandia Heights Services…for infor- mation.  “Haven’t pumped my septic tank in the 10 years  I’ve lived in Sandia Heights, and it’s never given me  a bit of trouble. So, I leave well enough alone.”  Many Sandia Heights residents have either heard  or spoken these same, or similar, words many times.  The fact is that septic tanks that aren’t pumped out  regularly may force effluent out of the underground  septic tank and into the drainfield before the tank’s  bacteria had sufficient time to do their work. This in- creases the chance of dispersing insufficiently  treated effluent into the drainfield and raises the  possibility that harmful contaminants may be re- leased into the soil and eventually reach the ground- water.  Another common misconception is that regular  pumping may harm the balance of bacteria in the  tank and create the need for more frequent pump- ing or even cause system failure. Actually, not pump- ing out the tank frequently enough can be a primary  cause of system failure and thousands of dollars in  repairs. The worst part is the absence of any warn- ing signs before the system fails. So don’t make the  mistake of presuming that a properly functioning  system means that the tank doesn’t need to be  pumped out.  Basic Septic Tank Chemistry  All the wastewater from your house is received  by the septic tank. When liquid and solid wastes en- ter the tank, the bacteria that live in the tank use the  organic materials as food. They, in turn produce  their own wastes which are mostly inorganic mate- rials that can be used as food by plant and animal  organisms normally present in the soil.  The bacteria doesn’t [sic] eat everything that  comes into the tank, so there’s a slow accumulation  of solid material—or sludge—at the bottom of the  tank. This is the septage that must be pumped out  regularly to keep your septic system operating  properly.  Drainfield Operation  When new wastewater is received by the septic  tank, it forces the effluent that’s been in the tank for  the longest period of time into an outlet pipe which  leads to the drainfield. How long the effluent stays  in the tank before going into the drainfield depends  on the size of tank, the amount of wastewater the  tank receives, and the amount of sludge accumula- tion at the bottom of the tank.  The drainfield receives the water (effluent) that  overflows into the outlet pipe of the septic tank.  Long perforated pipes drain this water into beds of  gravel which are buried in long trenches. The efflu- ent seeps through the gravel and into the soil where  it is treated by being filtered through the soil parti- cles and where the organisms normally present in  the soil devour a portion of the bacteria.  Sludge/Scum Inspection  Septic tanks should be inspected once a year to  monitor the accumulation of scum and sludge.  When half of the capacity of the tank is taken up by  solids, it’s time to pump the tank. For a fee, septic  tank pumping services will perform an inspection  for you. Following are instructions for conducting  your own scum and sludge inspection. [Ed: this sec- tion has not been field tested. Use at your own risk.  Better yet, call in a septic pumping company.]  To measure the scum accumulation, nail a three  inch square block to a pole and poke the block  through the scum layer. Carefully move the pole up  and down to feel the resistance as you move the  block up against the bottom surface of the scum  layer. Mark that place on the pole which is level with  the ground. Then feel around for the bottom of the  outlet pipe and mark that level on the pole. If the  two marks are three inches or less apart, your tank  needs to be pumped out.  Next wrap an old towel around the bottom of the  pole and fasten it with string or tape. Push the towel  down into the bottom of the tank and twirl it around  several times. Mark the pole at ground level. After a  minute or so, pull the pole out and measure the dis- tance between the top  of the  sludge  layer  (the top  15   The GRIT – April 2022 – Volume 38 – No. 4  Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.

If this distance is twelve inches or less,  your tank needs to be pumped out.  Don’t Abuse Your Septic System!  Poisoning. Many household items if used excessively can poison your septic system including drain clean- ers, toilet bowl cleaners, and other chemicals marked “Poison” or “Caustic”. Even bleach can cause prob- lems, although small quantities used in washing machines shouldn’t be harmful. Another potential poison is  the salt used in regenerating water softeners.  Choking. Another thing that should be avoided is adding solids to the tank that cannot be decomposed by  the bacteria. Newspaper, paper towels, rags, and coffee ground will accumulate and can clog the pipes or  force you to have your tank pumped more frequently.  Drowning. Excess water can lead to problems and failure of the tank or the drainfield. Be sure that plumb- ing fixtures are operating correctly. Even leaking faucets or toilets that don’t shut off properly after flushing  can cause system failure due to excess water. Surface runoff that drains into the tank and tree roots can also  cause the system to fail.  Suffocating. Be very sure where your system’s drainfield is located before expanding or adding driveways,  patios, pool decks, tennis courts, etc. Drainfields require oxygen to function properly and any nonpermeable  material on top of the field (asphalt, concrete) will suffocate the system.  Overworking. If you purchased a home that was previously occupied by fewer people or if the number of  people in your home has increased for any reason, you may need to enlarge both the tank and drainfield. Call  a company that specializes in septic tank installation and repair if you have doubts about the adequacy of  your septic system.   One final warning: Always beware of magic elixirs advertised to revitalize your septic system but which  come with no reliable guarantees!

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
