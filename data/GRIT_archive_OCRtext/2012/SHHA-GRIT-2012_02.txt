    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                             February 2012                President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry         February is one of my favorite months.  That may sound crazy, because February is  often the coldest and stormiest month, the  wintriest month of winter.  But it’s also  when we start to see signs of life in the  garden and the landscape.  The earliest bulbs  and perennial plants start to stick their noses  up out of the ground.  If you look closely,  you can see buds barely beginning to swell  on dead-looking twigs.  February also brings  Valentine’s Day, when we celebrate love  and affection.  Life returning to the land and  the spirit of Valentine’s Day always amplify  my awareness of why I love living in Sandia  Heights.  So here is a valentine to Sandia  Heights.       Ever since I can remember, I wanted to  live in Sandia Heights.  Even the name  sounded magical—it made me think of  eagles soaring over the mountaintop.  When  Sandia Heights was established, it was  pretty remote—none of the nearby  development you see today was here, and  “town” was a good way down the hill on dirt  roads.  But even as inexpensive as the lots  were by today’s standards, they cost more  than my parents could afford, so I had to  wait a long time to live here.  But now I’m  here, and every day I revel in the magic of  the place.         It’s hard to say what is my most favorite  thing about Sandia Heights, but the wildlife  is way up there.  It’s a great joy to be  sharing our habitat with such a variety of  wildlife, and it never ceases to thrill me  when I see a wild animal of any kind.  I’ve  seen bears, deer, bobcats, coyotes, foxes,   bridled weasels, raccoons, skunks, rabbits,  rock squirrels, bull snakes, rattlesnakes,  coachwhip snakes, pack rats, chipmunks,  hawks, and turkey vultures, as well as all  kinds of smaller birds right outside my  house, and I get excited every time.  Well,  maybe I get excited in a different way when  I see the squirrels eating my flowers!  The  best part is that the wild animals retain their  wildness, because Sandia Heights people  respect wildlife and their habitat, and have  learned how to coexist with them.       How cool is it to live nestled at the foot  of the beautiful Sandias, so close to them  that you can really see how they change  every time you look at them?  Only when  you’re this close do you realize how rugged  the mountains are on this side, a massive  tumble of huge boulders with piñons and  junipers somehow finding a way to grow  among them.  And to be in the middle of  such astonishing sunsets painting the sky in  the west while the mountains glow pink  behind us takes my breath away.  I never tire  of watching storms approach with their  magnificent clouds and lightning, and the  city lights sparkling below us delight me as  much as the day I moved up here.       You can’t beat being able to hike a  beautiful mountain trail a few minutes out  your door.  It’s also pretty amazing to feel  like you’re living out in the wilderness but  then hop in the car and be at the store in five  minutes.                                         Continued on page 2  The GRIT, February 2012                                                                                                    Page 2  Continued from Front Page         In fact, we do live almost in the  wilderness—the eastern boundary of Sandia  Heights marks the edge of the Sandia  Mountain Wilderness.  This means that the  mountains will always look like mountains,  unlike some communities where houses  march high up the sides.       Although driving on our streets  sometimes increases my adrenalin, I love the  narrow winding roads—it’s one reason  Sandia Heights looks like it belongs in the  landscape, along with the architectural styles  that are diverse yet harmonious with the  terrain and the stucco colors that blend with  the colors of our surroundings.  The native  vegetation and the lack of sidewalks  contribute to the feeling of living “away  from it all”, and keep Sandia Heights  looking uncluttered but not manicured.         Add to all this the friendly people in our  neighborhoods--and the fact that we have  the absolute best water in the County--and  it’s indisputable that we enjoy “the peak of  living”. We owe a debt of gratitude to the  people who had the vision and foresight to  create such a unique and beautiful  community, and to the countless volunteers  over the years who have worked so hard to  preserve to look and feel of Sandia Heights.                             SHHA Filing  Cabinets         The office has scanned  and digitized all the  Architectural Control and  Covenant Support Committee  Files.

This is very  unusual—although mountain lions do live in  the Sandia Mountains, they are very shy and  elusive—and most likely means that the  lions are suffering from the effects of the  drought along with other wildlife.       Lion attacks on people are very rare, with  fewer than a dozen fatalities in all of North  America in more than 100 years.  However,  we do share habitat with our Sandia lions, so  it’s a good idea to take some simple  precautions.  Lions are most active from  dusk to dawn, so make lots of noise if you  come and go during this time.  Closely  supervise children when they play outdoors.   Watch pets closely when they’re outside,  and never leave them outside alone,  especially at night.  Hike in groups, keep  your dog on a leash, and make lots of noise.       We can live peacefully with these  incredibly efficient predators if we respect  mountain lions and their habitat.  Please  follow these precautions, and urge your  neighbors to do the same.  If you have a  direct encounter with a lion or an attack  occurs, call NM Game and Fish at 222- 4700. More information about living in lion  country, including what to do if you meet a  lion, is posted on the SHHA website.

That’s the question we hear from other  homeowners’ associations in Albuquerque  when they find out the amount of dues paid  by SHHA members. We pay a great deal  less than other neighborhoods but we enjoy  an amazing variety of benefits for such a  small sum. However, expenses such as  office rent, utilities, labor costs, and  insurance costs have risen steadily over the  past several years, and the cost of popular  member benefits like Tram passes have also  increased significantly. For many years we  have continued to provide free Tram passes,  free Coffee House concerts, and Meet &  Greet social events, as well as a fully staffed  office with free copy and fax services, free  notary services, and the ever-cheerful  assistance of Betsy and Sheraz, without  raising the membership dues.        In an effort to continue providing these  valuable services that SHHA members have  come to depend on, we find it necessary to  increase our monthly dues. Effective March  1, 2012, SHHA membership dues will  increase from $8.00 to $10.00 per month.  The last time dues were raised was  approximately ten years ago, and we know  you will understand and support the need to  raise the dues at this time.                   TRAM  PASSES:   There are 6  corporate tram  passes per day!

Please refer to  that article if you are planning to install one  of these systems and for factors to consider  regarding the architectural and aesthetic  features that the ACC will be looking for  when reviewing your application.   Remember that the ACC has a guideline for  your use that provides information on these  types of installations. The guideline is  available in the SHHA office and online at  the SHHA website (sandiahomeowners.org).       After a “dry spell” of about a year, we  have seen an increase in applications for  residential PV systems.  Solar panels have  gotten cheaper and are available in sizes that  produce more electrical power than those  that were available a year or so ago—good  news for consumers.  In addition, the  industry now favors the use of micro  inverters to convert the direct current (DC)  produced by each individual panel into  usable alternating current (AC).  These  small inverters can be mounted directly to  the back of each individual panel and they  replace the much larger and more visible  macro inverters that were used in earlier  installations.  If a macro inverter fails, you  would lose all the power from the entire PV  system.  Since the micro inverters are unique  to each panel, failure of one of them would  only affect that panel and not the whole  system—a nice improvement.       In addition to the information contained  in the ACC guideline, here are a few  additional points to consider when planning  the installation of a PV system:  1.  A good “rule of thumb” is that here in  sunny New Mexico, a one kilowatt PV  system generates about 1800 kilowatt  hours of electrical power per year.   Knowing your annual energy  consumption (use your PNM records to  obtain this information) along with this  “rule of thumb”, you can size a PV  system to meet your needs.  2. For roof-mounted systems, make sure  your roof is in good working condition.   Many contractor will not install a PV  system on a “marginal” roof.  Also, if  your roof develops problems (leaks,  etc.), the presence of a lot of PV panels  makes it difficult for a roofer to gain  access to those portions of the roof under  the panels.  3. Once installed, don’t let large trees next  to your home shade the panels.  Any  amount of shading, including clouds,  reduces the electrical output of the  affected panels.  4. Orientation of PV panels relative to the  sun affects their efficiency.  The highest  efficiency is achieved if panels are  oriented to the south (at an azimuth of  180 degrees, to be precise).  An  orientation of plus or minus 20% from  that 180 degree value will result in a  relatively small (about 2%) decrease in  system efficiency.  For Albuquerque’s  latitude of 35 degrees, the ideal pitch  angle for the panels (the angle that the  panels are oriented above the horizontal)  is about 25-30 degrees.  However, pitch  angles as low as 15 degrees will result in  a decrease of only about 6% in overall  efficiency.  Larger deviations from the  southern azimuth orientation and from  the ideal pitch angles, of course, will  have a greater impact on overall system  efficiency.                                          Continued on page 8    The GRIT, February 2012                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7    5. Solar panels can be mounted on pitched or  flat roofs.  For pitched roofs, the panels can  be flush mounted or mounted at angles to  take advantage of azimuth and pitch angle  orientations.  For flat roofs, panels can be  installed using ballasted mounts or attached  to roof-penetrating support mounts.   Ballasted mounting usually requires that the  pitch angles be less than about 15 degrees  or so to limit the impact of system damage  due to high wind loads.  The advantage of  these types of systems is that they are easier  and cheaper to install than those systems  where roof penetrators are used.  The use of  roof penetrators permits the panels to be  installed at high efficiency pitch angles  without the worry of damage from strong  winds.  The ACC has seen applications for  all these types of installations.  6.  State and County statutes prohibit  homeowner association covenants from  preventing the installation of solar  collectors, so don’t worry about the ACC  “shooting down” your application for  installing PV panels.  The ACC’s goal is to  try to limit the negative visual   impacts of  these installations on neighboring  properties while at the same time not  causing undue efficiency reductions of your  PV system.  The ACC will work with you  to try to achieve the best possible system to  meet your needs while at the same time  addressing the concerns of the ACC relative  to the impact of your system on your  neighbors.  7.  Once your PV installation project has been  completed, please take the time to provide  feedback (both positive and negative) to the  SHHA office on your overall experience  with your contractor.  We don’t have much  data on these types of installations and any  feedback would be appreciated.    z  zz  zz  zz  z      z  zz  zz  zz  z  ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   29 Sandia Heights Drive – Solar Panels  61 Pinon Hill Place – Cover Wooden Fascia  and Trim  725-11 Tramway Vista Drive – Addition  1121 Marigold Drive – Solar Panels  1218 Rockrose Road – Window Replacement  1509 Eagle Ridge Road – Solar Light  installation  2103 Navajo Willow Drive – Reroof, Trim &  Paint Gate  2712 Tramway Circle – Reroof  2726 Tramway Circle – Wall  8241 Raintree Drive – Swamp Cooler  Replacement  Disapproved Projects:  364 Juniper Hill Road – Garage Addition  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z  Mail Theft         Mail theft is still a problem! Residents are  advised not leave mail in mailboxes, either  incoming or outgoing. If you cannot retrieve  your mail promptly ask a trusted neighbor to  get it for you. If you are leaving town suspend  your mail delivery, have it held at the Post  Office. Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle  checking mailboxes. A license number on a  vehicle along with a vehicle description would  go a long way to putting an end to this activity.  If you experience mail theft, notify the BCSO  (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876- 2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856-6347  and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in  progress notify BCSO and Security.   Advertisements do not represent an endorsement by SHHA.  | Moving. First time or fifth,  it just doesn't seem to get any  easier.
