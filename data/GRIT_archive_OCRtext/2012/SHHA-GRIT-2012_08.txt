The GRIT is mailed to  each residence in Sandia Heights. SHHA  membership dues are $10 per month. Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association is often  mistaken for Sandia Heights Services, which is a  separate company that provides  water, trash,  recycling and security services.     President’s Message   - Ann Zimmerman    Happy Trails…. Zoom, Zoom, Whiz, Whiz,  Whiz, Zoom “on your left” – whiz, whiz, zoom,  zoom, ring, ring. And so it goes on the multi use  path for bicycles and pedestrians. I am both a  bicyclist and a pedestrian on the Tramway Blvd.  multi use path. On most early mornings, this is a  very special place to be. The air is cool and the  morning light is reflecting off the trees and  native brush, enhancing the joy of a new day.  Lizards are busy searching for their morning  snack and the new baby bunnies are unsure of  their new surroundings their mothers have left  them in. The quail parents are directing and  herding their covey, which now number in the  range of 6 to 10 fleeting feet. What a wonderful  place to live!!    All of us, bicyclists (young and old, helmet and  no helmet), dogs (on a leash and off leash),  walkers, (of all ages), baby strollers, marathon  runners and even wheelchairs use and enjoy this  paved pathway. This is the essence of a ‘shared  path.’ It is important to remind each of its users  of our responsibilities in keeping this path safe  for all users.    The rules of a shared road are simple-  • Walkers, walk to the right, with the flow  of bicycle traffic  • Walkers, walk only two abreast leaving  room for walkers, runners, and bicycles  to pass on the left.  • Bicyclists, give an audible warning, “on  your left” when approaching walkers and  runners. A bell signals passing on the  left.  • Bicyclists, go with the flow, never ride  against traffic.  • Bicyclists, when you pass on the left  always have 3 feet of clear space on the  right.  Zoom, zoom, whiz, whiz, “On Your Left”,  whiz, whiz, whiz, ring, ring, ring – Thank  You!    Update on the amendment to the  Bernalillo County Wastewater  Ordinance.    Ordinance Amendment: The Bernalillo County  Commission has deferred action on a proposed  amendment to the Bernalillo County Wastewater  Ordinance until the September 11, 2012  Commission meeting. This meeting will take  place after the New Mexico liquid waste  regulations are updated in August.  At the  meeting, the Commission may 1) table the  amendment, 2) defer action in order to allow  time to consider the updated New Mexico liquid  waste regulations and revise the amendment to  incorporate some or all of the changes, or 3)  pass the amendment as written.      The proposed amendment to the ordinance  requires inspection of septic systems that are 30  years or older and on lots ¾ acre or smaller. If a  system passes, no action is required and the  system will be inspected again in five years. If a  system fails, it must be replaced with an  advanced wastewater treatment system.

All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true! Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience  some of the great “perks” of living in Sandia  Heights!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Sandia Heights Coffeehouse  Concert Series presents …    Steve Gillette &  Cindy  Mangsen   in concert    Church of the Good  Shepherd, 7834  Tennyson NE.

We will be delivering the new bins in late August, look for updates in your  Sandia Heights Services bill and on our website at www.sandiaheightsservivces.com.  Due to the  large number of customers who ordered recycle bins, we thought we would review how our  recycling program works to make it a great success.  What can I recycle?   #1 through #5 plastic bottles and jugs, rinsed and caps removed   Phone books, brown paper bags, cereal boxes (chipboard), newspapers,  magazines, catalogs, junk mail, home office paper, paperback and hardback books   Aluminum cans and tin/steel (soup & vegetable) cans rinsed and lids removed   Corrugated cardboard (broken down to fit in the recycle bin without over filling)  Beginning in September, all of the above recyclables should be placed loose in your recycle bin  (green lid).  We do not accept glass or Styrofoam because the facility we take the recyclables to does  not accept those items.  The recyclables are sorted by hand by their employees, so the glass would  pose an obvious hazard to their employees.  Also, in order for glass to be recycled, it needs to be  sorted by color of glass (green, blue, brown and clear).  Once it is comingled it cannot be recycled as  glass, but may be used for other purposes.  You may continue to take your glass containers to the  City’s drop off bins at Smith’s Grocery stores, etc.  We will continue to offer the recycling program every other week, please see the calendar on our  website at www.sandiaheightsservices.com for the correct recycling dates.  If you don’t have  internet access, please contact our office at 856-6419 and we will be happy to mail you a copy of the  calendar.    Thank you for your outstanding participation in our solid waste and recycling programs, your efforts  to continue to reduce, reuse and recycle are enabling our community to contribute to the  sustainability of our planet’s precious natural resources!   | Moving.

We would like as many Sandia Heights  residents as possible to attend the September 11  meeting to demonstrate our concern regarding  this matter.  We will post the time and location  on the SHHA website.    Replacing Septic Systems: SHHA has heard  from several homeowners who are upset about  having their septic tank pumped and then being  told that the septic tank or the leach field is  defective and must be replaced with an  advanced wastewater treatment system (also  known as secondary or tertiary systems).  The  County Wastewater Ordinance has very specific  criteria for requiring such advanced systems  (you can find a copy on the SHHA website).   You should ask the septic system company to  explain exactly what conditions, as listed in the  ordinance, lead them to believe the system  should be replaced with an advanced system.  If  you are not satisfied, you may call the Bernalillo  County Environmental Health Department at  505-314-0310 and ask them to verify the septic  system company’s findings.    Possible Sewer Line: The SHHA Wastewater  and Septic System Committee met with Sandia  Heights Services to explore the possibility of  constructing a central sewer line for Sandia  Heights. While this would solve septic system  issues in Sandia Heights, please be aware that  we are in the very preliminary stage of  investigating this possibility, and even if it is  feasible it will be decades before it becomes a  reality. We will continue to keep you informed  of new developments as they occur.    INCREASE YOUR NQ    NQ?  What’s that?  Neighborliness Quotient, of  course!

E. states “Animal Nuisances on  Sidewalks, Public Parks, Alleys, and Other  Places Open to the Public. It is unlawful for the  owner of any animal to permit, either willfully  or through failure to exercise due care of  control, any such animal to commit any  nuisance upon the sidewalk or public park; or  upon the floor or wall of any common hall in  any multiple dwelling; or upon any entrance  way, stairway or wall immediately abutting on a  public sidewalk, or upon the floor or wall of any  theater, shop, store, office building or other  building used in common by the public; or upon  any private property other than the owners of  the animal.”  Leaving your dog’s mess is not  only unsightly but also inconsiderate. Please be  considerate of your neighbors and pick up your  dogs waste material.  8   The GRIT – August 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 8                                                                                                     z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:   1 Sandia Heights Drive – Gate and Concrete Slab  152 Juniper Hill Road – Door Replacement  191 Big Horn Ridge Circle – Restucco  208 Spring Creek Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  213 Spring Creek Place – Reroof, Restucco &  Refinish Trim  314 Big Horn Ridge Road – Addition  371 Bighorn Ridge Road – Evaporative Cooler  Replacement  510 Roadrunner Lane – Reroof  536 Black Bear Road – Roof & Stucco Repair  546 Black Bear Loop – Reroof  559 Black Bear Place – Resurface Driveway  561 Black Bear Road – Reroof, Restucco & Window  Replacement  574 Black Bear Road - Restucco  576 Black Bear Road – Gutter Replacement  720 1-29 Tramway Lane – Paint Wood & Trim  726-34 Tramway Vista Drive – Roof Repair  727-8 Cedar Hill Lane - Restucco  804 Tramway Lane – Driveway Replacement  806 Tramway Lane – After the fact Landscaping  867-B Tramway Lane Court – Gutter Repair and  Resurface Driveway  875 Tramway Lane Court – Heating Equipment  903 Tramway Lane – Garage Door Replacement  924 Tramway Lane – HVAC Replacement  930 Tramway Lane – Resurface Driveway  945 Deer Drive – Reroof  1025 Tramway Lane – Garage Addition  1103 Marigold Drive – PV Panels & Patio Cover  1155 Laurel Loop – Patio, Wall & Landscaping  1168 Laurel Loop – Reroof  1185 Laurel Loop – Resurface Driveway  1187 Laurel Loop – Addition  1191 Laurel Loop – Paint Wood Trim & Lintels,  Driveway Resurfacing  1243 Rockrose Road – Swamp Cooler Screen  1465 Bluebell Drive – Addition  1560 Eagle Ridge Road – Front Door Replacement  1803 Tramway Terrace Loop – Porch Roof Repair  1862 Tramway Terrace Loop – Retaining Wall  Replacement  1866 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence  1946 Quail Run Loop – Garage Door Replacement  2038 Tramway Lane – Resurface Driveway  2173 Black Willow Drive – Paint Garage Door,  Reroof & Stucco Repair  2182 Cattail Willow Ave – Landscaping  2306 Calle de Rafael – Window Replacement  2325 Calle de Gabriel – Window/Door Replacement  2447 Tramway Terrace Court – Roof Repair  2705 Tramway Circle – Repair Fence & Paint Trim  2729 Tramway Circle – Paint Trim  2801 Tramway Circle - Patio Roof Repair  2815 Tramway Circle – Parapet Repair & Restucco  Disapproved  355 Live Oak Road – Reroof White Membrane  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to read  about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Useful Project Planning Tips—The  ACC Design Guidelines  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    Over the past years, the ACC has developed six  Design Guidelines for use by all property  owners in Sandia Heights.

They are not  meant to supersede any of the Unit covenants.   These Guidelines are available at the SHHA  office and on the SHHA website.  A brief  summary of these Guidelines is provided  below.  1.  Detached Buildings:  This Guideline  ensures that detached structures comply with  all covenants, are in harmony with the primary  residence, adjacent buildings, and the natural  landscape, and do not adversely affect the  value of neighboring properties.  The  Guideline provides a detailed definition of  what is included in the definition of detached  buildings.  2.  Landscaping:  This Guideline was  prepared to ensure that the installation of  landscaping is in compliance with the  covenants, blends with its surroundings, and  uses plant and tree types that are courteous to  the neighborhood by considering potential  view obstruction, water conversation, pollen  emission, etc.  The Guideline specifies  limitations on location, height, and size of  landscaped areas and plant selection in order  to minimally impact open spaces and natural  vegetation.  3.  Roofing:  This Guideline ensures that  roofing materials are in compliance with the  covenants, blend with their surroundings, and  do not reflect nuisance levels of reflected light  onto nearby properties.  The Guideline also  establishes standards for the selection of roof  colors and finishes.  4.  Setbacks:  This Guideline ensures that  residences, outbuildings, walls, and other  structures are placed on lots in accordance  with the covenants to retain the open and  natural character of Sandia Heights.  Setbacks  are defined for street frontage, side, and rear  boundary distances.  The Guideline also  establishes a process for reducing setback  distances for lots that have insufficient  buildable areas and that qualify for the  granting of a variance, such as oddly-shaped  lots, lots with physical impediments, and lots  with unusually high amounts of street  frontage.  5.  Solar Collectors:  This Guideline  addresses the installation of all types of solar  collectors to ensure that the devices are in  compliance with the covenants, blend with  their surroundings, do not unduly obstruct  views, and do not produce objectionable light  reflections onto neighboring properties.  The  Guideline establishes limitations on the  location, height, color, and finishes of the  collectors and their associated mounting  hardware.  6.  Walls and Fences:  This Guideline ensures  that walls and fences are in compliance with  the covenants, blend with their natural  surroundings, and are constructed of durable,  high quality materials.  The Guideline  specifies limitations on the location, height,  and size of areas to be enclosed within the  finished wall or fence.
