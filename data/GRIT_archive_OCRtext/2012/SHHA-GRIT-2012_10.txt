Of all the holidays,  including Christmas, Halloween was my very,  very favorite time. Tricker Treating was the  night I lived for. Well, that was about to change,  and not for the better.  The Raton School Superintendent, and mighty  School Board had decided that Tricker Treating  was too dangerous. Can you imagine that! All  three elementary schools would have a school  carnival. This was terrible news, NO CANDY!  This decision was a major disaster and I was not  alone. The only bright light shinning was there  would be a costume contest, and three prizes  would be awarded. Now this was of interest to  me. I decided that I, Ann Zimmerman, would  win first prize in this contest. All my waking  hours along with some dreams were spent on  what great costume could I make. You certainly  remember in 1951 there were NO store bought  costumes.  After much thought, I decided that my costume  would be Black Beard the Pirate. No one would  think of that, and besides no one could make this  costume better than my Dad, and me! When Dad  came home, after working the swing shift on the  Santa Fe Railroad, I was waiting for him with  the news that I had made a decision on “what I  would be.” I ran out the door, down the  driveway to meet him, and gave him the news  about Black Beard the Pirate. Dad was tired,  after working twelve hours, but he found some  energy in my excitement, and said, “What have  you decided.” Of course, I replied with great  enthusiasm, “Black Beard the Pirate and you  have to keep it a secret from Mom and Norma.”  Norma, my Mother’s other daughter was going  to be Snow White, how boring.  Dad and I had a week to work on this costumer.  He made me a wooden sword, a felt pirate’s hat,  a black eye patch, and a red bandana. I had a  white shirt and a tattered pair of jeans that we  dyed black. Dad made me a large square belt  buckle out of some left over tin. The two of us  looked and looked for a pirate coat, and finally  found a long black coat at the thrift store. It  smelled, but Dad said that the smell would make  it believable. We hung it outside for several  days, and it was wearable.  Everything was coming together until I found a  picture of Black Beard. Black Beard had a peg  leg. Dad and I discussed this discovery for at  least a day, and we just could not come up with  how we could devise a peg leg, that I could walk  on. Dad thought that the peg leg was not that big  of a deal, but he could not convince me. I  needed a peg leg to win!  The night of Halloween was upon us, and I did  not have a peg leg. Dad looked over at our  kitchen table, and said “Oh Ann, I have it! A peg  let!” Dad cut the middle leg off our kitchen  table, our only table, and made me a peg leg. He  attached the table leg to a platform that my leg  could be attached to, when bent at the knee. The  smelly old coat covered the bent portion of my  leg, and yippy, I had a peg leg. The time had  come, and off we went to the Halloween  Carnival.

Continued from front page    There were witches, ghosts, scarecrows, and Snow White, but  mine was the BEST! 8:00 PM arrived, and it was time for the  winners to be announced. Third place Tommy Armstrong,  cowboy. Second place Ann Zimmerman, Blackbeard the Pirate,  and first place Norma Zimmerman, Snow White. I was sure  they had us mixed up, second place and first place, but when I  questioned them, they said, “No Ann, you are the second place  winner.” CONGRATULATIONS! My prize was a ticket to the  movies. Norma’s prize was a witches’ hat full of CANDY, of  which I got none.    This was my first lesson in recognizing the art and necessity of  humility as a quality of good character. Dad’s words to me, as I  stomped into the house, were “Ann, winning is not all it is  cracked up to be. You need to not only be a good winner, but a  good 2nd place loser.”     zz  zz  zz  z  zz  zz  zz     Announcements & Notices:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.    Office Closed: Monday, October 8 – Columbus Day   Board Meeting – Wednesday, October 10, at the SHHA  office, 7pm   Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes, email alerts and  contractor evaluation binder free to members.    Committee meetings are posted on our website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.   Classified ads can be found on the website on  the top bar menu under Classifieds.    Safety Vests for sale in the SHHA office. $2  per vest for members.     zz  zz  zz  z  zz  zz  zz     School is back in session:    Please be reminded that schools are  back in session now so please watch  your speed throughout the  subdivision.

Until now, SHHA policy has been to mail the  GRIT to all residents, both members and non- members. Due to the rising costs associated  with printing the GRIT, and as a result of  evaluating the benefits of membership, after  October we will no longer be mailing the  GRIT to non-members. If you would like to  continue receiving the GRIT in the mail, now is  the time to sign up for SHHA membership. At  only $10 a month, it’s a great bargain. Even if  you take advantage of our most popular  benefit—free Tram passes, a value of $20 per  ticket—membership pays for itself very quickly.  Add the other benefits of free notary services,  free copy and fax services, free Coffeehouse  Concerts, the Speaker Series, Easter Egg Hunt,  Visit Santa Claus, and discounts at many local  businesses, and your $10 monthly dues is a very  worthwhile investment.    Another benefit that will now be available only  to members is our E-mail Alert service. You can  sign up for this service by emailing  sandiaheights@comcast.net.   Please put your  address in the subject line and a short message  requesting to be added to our email alert system.  When you sign up for this service, SHHA will  notify you by e-mail of burglaries in your  neighborhood and other security alerts, fire  alerts, wildlife alerts, and other important  information that you need to know quickly.  Much of this information comes directly from  Bernalillo County sources, and it’s a great way  to receive information in a timely manner.  If  you are a non-member and want to continue  receiving e-mail alerts, sign up for SHHA  membership today!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Tram Passes    There are 6 corporate tram  passes per day! Please note that  the Tram will be closed for Fall  Maintenance starting Monday,  November 5 through Friday, November 16.  Please call the SHHA office at 797-7793 for  details.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Renters and Membership Benefits    Did you know that people renting houses in  Sandia Heights can participate in many of the  benefits of SHHA membership? All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true! Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience  some of the great “perks” of living in Sandia  Heights!  z  zz  zz  zz  z  4   The GRIT – October 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 10                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:  Please be reminded  that Sandia Heights Services Tel: 856-6419 (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

We delivered over 4,000 new trash and  recycle bins to our customers during the week of August 27, and in our first week of service we have  seen a significant increase in recycling.  Thank you for your patience and support during this huge  undertaking, it is greatly appreciated.  If you need to change or add to your bin order, please do so  via email at customerservice@sandiapeak.com.      As a reminder, the trash bin has the dark brown lid, and the recycle bin has the green lid.  All trash  must be bagged within the trash bin with the lid closed.  This will prevent spills and help to keep  the bin clean. Lawn clippings and branches need to be bagged or bundled in the trash bin to prevent  such items from being blown around and/or scattered.  The most important point to remember is to  be sure the bin can be emptied, with nothing impeding the contents of the bin (for example large  branches).  Recyclables must be placed loose in the recycle bin, not bagged, with the exception  of shredded paper.  For those instances when you have additional uncontained trash or  appliances, furniture, etc., we will continue to offer the special pickup service on Mondays for  a minimum charge of $20.  Additional charges may apply depending on what you have for  collection. Simply contact our office at 856-6419 to schedule the special pickup when you need the  service. Also, please do not spray paint or mark the outside of your bin with your address or name.   You may mark the inside of the bin or lid with your address to identify your bin, but please do not  mark up the outside of the bin.    Again, thank you for your cooperation and support during the implementation of this new  service!  If you have any questions please contact our office at 856-6419, via email at  customerservice@sandiapeak.com, or visit our website at www.sandiaheightsservices.com.   23 YEAR RESIDENT  MAX SANCHEZ  LIVES, KNOWS & LOVES SANDIA HEIGHTS  In ALL Market Conditions, Max Consistently Sells More Homes in Sandia Heights than ANY other Realtor  33 Years of Experience  #1 Individual Coldwell Banker Agent in New Mexico  Interior and Exterior Painting Providing Great Work, by Great People for 25 years!

At the Bernalillo County Commission  meeting on September 11, 2012, the  Commissioners were informed by  Commissioner Stebbins that she is withdrawing  her motion to amend the Bernalillo County  Waste Water Ordinance. She stated that upon  accumulation of further data and information  she may introduce the motion again sometime in  the future.         This means that there will be no routine 5  year septic system inspections as originally  proposed. However, the County ordinance still  contains the implication that advanced systems,  containing pumps, air circulation devices, etc.,  may be required.  These advanced systems come  with a high price tag and a yearly maintenance  contract, and are being promoted by the septic  tank - leach field installers.        Homeowners should be advised that only in  extreme hydrogeological conditions are such  advanced systems required. For example such  conditions may exist if there is insufficient  acreage to install a leach field, or if a lot has less  than a suitable depth of gravel/sand to receive a  septic tank or a leach field (i.e. if the property  sits on a slab of granite or bedrock).        As a good starting point to question the  requirement for an advanced system is the  County ordinance, a copy is available for view  in the SHHA office or on the SHHA website at  sandiahomeowners.org. For example, a primary  system (consisting of a septic tank and a leach  field) is adequate on a 0.75 acre lot when the  total flow into the system is 380 gallons or less  per day (GPD) (see Chart I, Maximum Total  Flow Rate, Sec. 42-508). The GPD can be  obtained from your Sandia Heights Services  water bill. It should be obvious that the flow  into the septic tank cannot be more than the  GPD of water used on a property.       If there are any disagreements about the  requirement for an advanced system between a  homeowner and the pumper/inspector/installer  of septic systems call the County Health  Department (505-314-0310). One of their  employees is required to come out to your  property and determine if an advanced system is  indeed required.        It should be emphasized, as stated in the  County ordinance, that it is the property owner’s  responsibility to maintain a functional  wastewater system that is not polluting the  groundwater. Pumping a septic tank about every  4 years will help maintaining a functional  system.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Keep our Sandia Bears Safe!    Bears are still visiting our neighborhoods  looking for food, and now, in early autumn, they  have become eating machines. Bears are  biologically programmed to eat as much as they  can in preparation for their long winter’s nap.   Unlike last year, we have a pretty good acorn  crop this year.  But because bears need to gain  so much weight before they den, they might  venture down into our neighborhood looking for  their natural food sources, including acorns,  piñon nuts, and prickly pear fruit.  If they find  food humans leave out, like garbage or bird  seed, that spells trouble for the bears.  Bird seed  especially is very calorie-dense, and if bears  find it they will keep coming back looking for  more.  Please stay alert and don’t do anything to  attract bears to your home.  Keep trash indoors  until the morning of pickup, bring bird feeders  and hummingbird feeders indoors at night, and  keep kitchen doors and windows closed after  dark.  Please understand that a trapped bear  does not transplant well. A high percentage of  bears die after being relocated.  Simply seeing  a bear is not a reason to call Game and Fish.  If  there is no “junk food” to be found, the bear will  probably munch a few acorns and go back into  the mountains.    8   The GRIT – October 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 10                                                                                                     z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:     5 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  16 Juniper Hill Loop – Landscaping  91 Juniper Hill Road – Landscaping  361 Big Horn Ridge – Fence Replacement  419 Live Oak Court - Mailbox  440 Live Oak Loop – Rooftop Ductwork  547 Black Bear Loop – Landscaping  626 Blackhawk Drive – Reroof & Restucco  720-3 Tramway Lane – Reroof  726-6 Tramway Vista Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  884 Tramway Lane Court – Fence Replacement   938 Bobcat Blvd. – Garage Addition  1105 San Rafael Ave. – Restucco  1126 Marigold Drive – Paint Wall  1158 Laurel Loop – Wall  1167 Laurel Loop - Driveway  1199 Bobcat Blvd. – Reroof & Trim  1416 San Rafael – Garage Addition  1837 Tramway Terrace Loop – Restucco  1843 Tramway Terrace Loop – Window  Replacement  1903 Quail Run Road – Parapet Repair  2305 Calle De Rafael – Driveway Replacement  2325 Calle de Gabriel – Repaint House  2535 Tramway Terrace Court – Enclose Patio  2867 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  8218 Raintree Drive – Driveway Replacement  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to read  about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z                z  zz  zz  zz  z    RESIDENTIAL  BURGLARY  PREVENTION TIPS  Most residential burglars  do not put very much  thought into their crime. They usually target a  residence based on information known to them  at that particular moment. Understanding how  burglars choose a target will help mitigate the  risks and deter them from targeting you.  Most burglars look for the following:  -  Items worth stealing and easily fenced  -  Ease of access  -  Low visibility  -  Homes that are unoccupied    o Use motion lights  o Use automatic timers to turn indoor lights on  and off to make it appear you are at home  o Park your vehicles in the garage  o Keep your yard clean and free of vegetative  overgrowth.  Areas around windows and  entries should be cleared  o Keep doors locked when you are at home  alone  o ALWAYS lock all doors and windows when  leaving the house  o Do not hide spare keys outside your home  o Take discarded boxes which contained items  you just purchased, such as televisions,  DVD players and other electronics to the  city dump yourself. Burglars will take note  of boxes indicating recent purchases of high  end electronics which are placed in your  trash bin on garbage collection days.   o Make sure your parking place, driveway and  yard is adequately illuminated at night  o Ask a neighbor to watch over your home  and pick up deliveries while you are away  z  zz  zz  zz  z    Moving.
