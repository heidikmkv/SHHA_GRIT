Continued from Front Page    The decision is reprinted here in anticipation of the  commencement of these concerts in May 2012. SHHA has  determined that the summer concerts sponsored by the County  Line Restaurant, in and of themselves, do not constitute an  annoyance or nuisance as specified in the Unit 7 covenants.       Because the term “annoyance or nuisance” is not defined in the  covenants with respect to any objective standards, the term  may be interpreted subjectively by SHHA and individual  property owners within Sandia Heights.  In the absence of  objective standards set forth in the covenants, courts will  interpret the covenants narrowly in order to preserve the  property owner’s free enjoyment of his or her property (in this  case, the County Line Restaurant) within the scope of the  covenants.       The Unit 7 covenants permit the use of the County Line  properties for “light commercial uses as permitted by the  zoning ordinances of Bernalillo County, New Mexico then in  effect, under the zoning designation C”.  Concerns related to  excessive noise, traffic control, adherence to State laws related  to the distribution of alcoholic beverages, and unruly behavior  of concert attendees fall under the jurisdiction of the County  and State, as appropriate.  SHHA cannot and will not interfere  with the enforcement of these matters.                SHHA SECRETARY ~ Sarah Pirkl         The proposed amendment to the bylaws is available on  the website. We will vote on that at the annual meeting  scheduled for Saturday, June 9, 2012. If you have any  questions regarding the proposed amendment please contact  the office.               ANNOUNCEMENT:          It is with sorrow that we announce the  death of Sandia Heights resident and  former Wildflower Club President Daniel  Caudillo on February 29. Daniel operated  a successful landscaping business, Sandia Environmental  Design, and had many Sandia Heights clients. His work  received national recognition, including being featured on an  episode of Home & Garden Television in 2001. He will be  greatly missed. Our deepest sympathy to his wife Jacqueline.

All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true!   Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Tram passes are among the most  popular member benefits, so be sure you  maintain your membership so your tenants can  experience some of the great “perks” of living  in Sandia Heights!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    SHHA Miscellaneous Items for  Sale at the SHHA office to SHHA members  only and on a first come, first serve basis.

Photo: University of Texas at El Paso    This creepy-looking critter is not a scorpion,  even though it tries to look like one.  This  masquerade is what gets them squashed by  people who don’t know what they are.  This is a  VINEGAROON (Mastigoproctus giganteus),  sometimes called a whiptail scorpion.   It can  grow to three inches long or more, not including  the tail.    Wait, didn’t I just say it wasn’t a scorpion?   Why is it called a whiptail scorpion?  The  answer is obvious if you look at the long, thin  whiplike tail.  Vinegaroons are related to spiders  and have eight legs, although the first pair of  legs is used like antennae and not for walking.   They are completely harmless to humans—the  tail does not have a stinger--although the curved  mouthparts can deliver a pinch.  The name  “vinegaroon” comes from the creature’s habit,  when threatened, of spraying a mist from the  base of its tail that is primarily acetic acid, or  vinegar.  Legend has it that if a vinegaroon bites  you, everything will taste like vinegar for  weeks.  Of course this is not true, but if you get  a spray of vinegar in your face you probably  won’t like it!  Vinegaroons are nocturnal, and  they prey on insects and other arthropods.    So if you happen to see a vinegaroon, be happy  that it’s keeping the cricket and other insect  populations in balance.  It’s another of our wild  neighbors that we can’t do without—even  though it isn’t exactly cute!    KEEP BEARS WILD     Bears started coming out of hibernation in late  March, and now, in May, they are ranging  farther afield to find food.  Remember, they  didn’t eat all winter, and they’re hungry!  Last  year, the first calls to NM Game & Fish about  bears in town were in May, so it’s not too early  to start modifying our behavior for bear season.   We want to keep our dwindling population of  bears in the Sandias wild, and the only way to  assure they stay wild is by not having anything  on our property that would attract them.  This  means keeping garbage in the garage and not  putting it out until the morning of trash pickup,  bringing bird feeders inside at night (or stop  feeding the birds during the time bears are  active, usually April through mid-November),  and storing pet food and extra bird seed inside  the house or garage.  Please do your part to keep  our bears safe!  In 2011 NM Game and Fish  removed 27 bears from the Sandias (out of an  estimated population of no more than 50), and  the majority of those were killed.  These bears’  only crime was taking advantage of food left  easily available by humans.  Let’s make this a  better year for our bears!    County Prepares New Voting  System By Dan McKay / Journal Staff  Writer on Fri, Apr 13, 2012     Bernalillo County wants voters to be ready for a  new way of casting ballots on Election Day.  Starting with the June primary, the county will  employ “My Vote Centers” in which voters can  cast ballots at any location rather than being tied  to one precinct on Election Day, County Clerk  Maggie Toulouse Oliver said Friday. The  concept is similar to early voting. “Simply put,  there will be no wrong place to vote,” Oliver  said.    There will be nearly 70 voting locations on  Election Day rather than the usual 170 or so.  The city of Albuquerque used a similar system  in last year’s municipal election. The county is  The GRIT, May 2012                                                                                                                   Insert  launching an information campaign to get  people used to the idea. The county website,  bernco.gov, now features a link at the top for  “My Vote Center.” Voters can enter their name  and birth date to pull up customized information  on which districts they’re in and whether they’re  eligible to vote in the primary, which is only for  Republicans and Democrats.    Plugging in an address will reveal which vote  centers are closest, along with driving directions  to them. Clicking on the link for a particular  voting location will also provide wait times, so  people can see which places are busiest, Oliver  said. The first early-voting location, at 620  Lomas NW, will open May 8. The primary  election is June 5. Oliver said the move to voter  centers rather than traditional precincts will save  money and make voting more convenient.    When an SHHA Board member used the BC  website and entered his personal info and his  Sandia Heights resident information, he  obtained the following information about the  nearest election day VOTING CENTER.  In this  case, it was the same voting location he used  last year.  See website response below:   According to your registered address, our  records indicate that the nearest Election  Day Voting Convenience Center is: Double  Eagle Elementary, 8901 Lowell Dr. NE    Security Alert:  Some Sandia Heights residents have  experienced several incidents of slashed tires  and vandalized mailboxes in the last 45 days.  There have also been a few vehicle break-ins in  which thieves stole registration and insurance  information. Please be on the lookout for these  types of incidents and promptly report them to  the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department at  798-7000 and to Sandia Heights Security at  856-6347 or 263-4654.

At the March 13, 2012 meeting of the  Bernalillo County Commission, the  Commissioners voted to defer action on the  amendment to the Wastewater Ordinance until  September 11, 2012.  The recent letter from the  County Environmental Health Department to  Sandia Heights homeowners with lots smaller  than three-quarters of an acre summarized the  requirement proposed in the amendment for  those septic systems to be inspected every five  years; however, until the amendment is acted  upon, the inspection requirement is not in  effect.  Nonetheless, we encourage Sandia  Heights homeowners to keep their septic  systems in good operating condition.        In the meantime, the SHHA Wastewater and  Septic System Committee will continue to work  with the County to achieve an acceptable  solution to the septic system inspection issue,  independent of lot size. The Committee will  also continue to question the current “one-size- fits-all” requirement to upgrade to expensive  secondary and tertiary systems in the event a  septic system fails.  The Committee understands  that the ultimate solution to septic system issues  is to install a centralized sewer system.  We will  encourage the County to continue to evaluate  the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of  connecting all residents in Sandia Heights to a  central sewage line.              OUR OLD NEMESIS—THOSE  PESKY WILDFIRES ~ Bob Bower,  Chairman, ACC       If you haven’t already noticed, this area has  had at least four wildfires in the last several  months which probably means that this year’s  fire season will be similar to last year’s season  with a higher-than-normal chance for localized  wildfires. Weather predictions are indicating  limited precipitation and above-normal  temperatures which are key ingredients for  those occasional wildfires that we experience  now and then. As a property owner, you have  access to several good sources of information  that recommend measures you can take to  enhance the survivability of your property in the  event of a wildfire on or near your property. The  best source we have found was published by the  New Mexico State Forestry (NMSF) entitled  Creating Wildfire-Defensible Zones and is  available at the NMSF website using the  following link:   http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/emnrd/biomass/d ocs/Defensible%20Space.pdf.  Copies of this  brochure are also available at the SHHA office.       As I indicated last year, most of our unit  covenants state that “natural vegetation is to be  left undisturbed where practical on all lots  except for access to property, clearing of  building sites, and establishment of lawns and  flower beds adjacent to buildings”.   Continued on page 8  The GRIT, May 2012                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7    The ACC has published a Design Guideline for  Landscaping which makes the following points:  1.  Sandia Heights is based on an open space  concept where natural vegetation is of  great importance.  The deed restrictions  for the area require that natural  vegetation be left undisturbed where  possible and replenished after  construction is finished.  2.  Residents are asked to keep their  properties clear of dead trees and other  vegetation since this material is easily  combustible.       The use of the terms “where practical” and  “where possible” gives you, the property owner,  latitude to make wise decisions based on your  perception of the damage to your property that  could occur as a result of a local wildfire.  Although SHHA does not endorse a “bare  earth” policy as it pertains to vegetation on your  property, the removal of combustible material  near your home or your detached structures  makes good sense. In addition, if you feel the  points made in the above-referenced NMSF  article make sense for your particular property,  the SHHA and the ACC will not stand in your  way if you feel you want to implement some or  all of the article’s recommendations.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   47 Pinon Hill Place – Window Replacement  97 Juniper Hill Road – Landscaping  209 Spring Creek Drive – Garage Reroof  209 Spring Creek Drive – Reroof  216 Spring Creek Place – Landscaping  309 Big Horn Ridge – Window & Door  Replacement  355 Live Oak Road – Garage Addition  364 Juniper Hill Road – Garage Addition  506 Black Bear Loop – Paint Garage Door  569 Black Bear Road – Restucco & Trim  574 Black Bear Road – Reroof  725-8 Tramway Lane – Fence  726-31 Tramway Vista Loop – Fence  735 Tramway Lane – Remodel  795 Tramway Lane, Unit A – Landscaping  795 Tramway Lane, Unit N – Carport &  Pathway  869 A Tramway Lane Court - Reroof  938 Bobcat Blvd – Reroof  950 Deer Drive – Restucco & Window  Replacement  981 Antelope Avenue - Repaint Trim  1059 Red Oaks Loop – Skylight Replacement  1011 Tramway Lane – Roof Repair  1235 Rockrose Road - Restucco  1548 Eagle Ridge Lane – Restucco  1570 Eagle Ridge Court – Steps, Window &  Door Replacement  1843 Tramway Terrace Loop – Window  Replacement  2012 Quail Run Drive – Re-roof  2106 Navajo Willow Drive – Evaporative  Cooler Replacement  2157 Black Willow Drive – Landscaping  2504 Tramway Terrace Court - Reroof  2722 Tramway Circle – Fence Replacement  2821 Tramway Circle - Reroof  2878 Brushwood Street – Gate & Mailbox  Replacement  8241 Raintree Drive – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  9108 Lynx Loop – Mailbox replacement and  Restucco  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z  In Association with Remax  • World’s Largest Real Estate Company Network  •  REMAX Elite  •  8300 Carmel Avenue  NE, Ste 201 Albuquerque, NM 87122   (505) 798-1000 EXT. 1024  BEST NUMBER (505) 269-6217 Judson McCollum Executive Broker 10 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-3717 JudsonABQ@aol.com Sharon McCollum Executive Broker 15 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-6217 SMMinABQ@aol.com Sharon and Judson McCollum promoteTop VALUES and SALES in  Sandia Heights!

WILD FLOWER HIKES, MAY 19 AND MAY 26, 2012  Currently the Forest Service plans to hold wild flower hikes in Elena Gallegos Park May 19  and 26 beginning at 9:00 AM. We meet at the most eastern parking area and will take the  path leading to the Pino Trail.  As a special treat, Larry Littlefield and Pearl Burns,  authorities and authors of the magnificent new book Wildflowers of the Sandia and Manzano  Mountains of Central New Mexico will be present. Following the hike, I have invited them to  assist in discussing their new book, signing copies on May 19. They charge $25.00 a copy.   You may wonder if you should go on a wild flower hike if the weather is windy and or rainy?  Of course that is up to you, but Pearl has told us that we have raincoats and yes, it may  affect how one enjoys viewing flowers on a windy day, but the flowers will not blow away.  Richard Frederiksen, Forest Service Volunteer and Sandia Heights Homeowner    Sandia Heights Neighborhood Meetup   If you are interested in participating in a variety of activities with your neighbors, consider  joining the “Meetup” group that has recently been established.
