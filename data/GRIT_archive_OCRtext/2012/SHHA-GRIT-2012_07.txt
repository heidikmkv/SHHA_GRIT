The GRIT is mailed to  each residence in Sandia Heights. The dues are  $10 per month. Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association is often mistaken for Sandia Heights  Services, the water, trash, recycling and security  Company.     Outgoing President’s Message   - Kate Fry    Many thanks to all of you who came to the  Annual Meeting on June 9th.  We had a great  turnout for the meeting and for the Town Hall  Meeting that followed, with 59 households  attending.  Your Board of Directors and  committee volunteers worked hard to put the  meeting together, and everything went off  without a hitch. I think everyone was impressed  by the hard work of the dedicated Board and  committee volunteers and by how much we have  accomplished this year. We really appreciate  your concern and support for our community  that you demonstrated by attending the meeting.   Special thanks go to our incredible office staff,  Betsy and Sheraz, who organized the Annual  Meeting and made sure everything went  smoothly.  Their professionalism and dedication  are unmatched, and we would be lost without  them. They are the “face” of SHHA, and I’m  sure you know they are happy to assist you in  any way they can and to answer your questions.      I am pleased to introduce your new officers and  Board of Directors for 2012-2013.  Ann  Zimmerman will serve as President, and Joe  Pappe will serve as your Vice President. Joe is  also the new chair of the Covenant Support  Committee (CSC). George Connor has agreed to  serve as Secretary. Ann Marie Caffrey has  agreed to continue to serve as Treasurer and  chair of the Finance Committee.    We welcomed five new Board members at the  Annual Meeting: Anderson Kressy, Patrick  Lancione, Meeko Oishi, Josephine Porter, and  Ed Stretanski. Each new member brings  outstanding experience and skills to SHHA.    As you know, I stepped down from the Board  and as President, and we are losing four other  Board members this year. Burt O’Neil served on  the Board for six years and was the chair of the  Communications and Publications Committee.   Burt also chaired the ad hoc Website Redesign  Committee that was responsible for our  outstanding new website. Andy Anderson was a  member of the Board for five years. He has ably  served as President, Vice President, chair of the  Finance Committee and chair of the CSC. Ana  Acosta joined the Board in 2010 and was chair  of the Community Service and Membership  Committee. Sarah Pirkl became a Board member  in 2010 and has served as Secretary. We will  miss all of them, and I extend my sincere thanks  for their service to SHHA and to the Sandia  Heights community.      Your Association exists to support you, the  members, and to uphold the standards that make  Sandia Heights such a unique and beautiful  community. But we need your help! Please  consider volunteering for one of our committees  or for the Board. Two committees that really  need members are Community Service and  Membership (CS&M) and Covenant Support  (CSC), but we’ll gladly accept volunteers for  any of our committees.     We welcome your calls and emails expressing  your concerns.  You may call the SHHA office  at 797-7793 or send us an e-mail at  shha@sandiahomeowners.org.  2   The GRIT – July 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 7                                                                                                        Officers  President – Ann Zimmerman  Vice President – Joe Pappe  Secretary – George Connor  Treasurer – Ann Marie  Caffrey  Board Members  Phil Abshere  Bob Bower  Sharon Evanich  Pete Heinstein  Anderson Kressy  Patrick Lancione  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Josephine Porter  Ed Stretanski  Dick Wavrik    Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator &  Publications &  Communications Editor    SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org    GRIT Editorial Policy is:     Provide information on  subjects of interest to the  community.     Reserve the right to edit  any submission.   Not to print any unsigned  letters or articles.      A Perfect Way To Start A Day       As the sun comes up over the beautiful Sandia Mountain, the  morning dawn begins to lighten.  There is a constant in my life  as I awake with morning coffee in my hand.  However this  morning my routine is broken, actually shattered.  There is no  light in the sky at 4:00 A.M., and it is two hours earlier than I  would usually greet, and welcome a new day.  Why am I up at  this hour?  A plane to catch, baggage to check, lines to stand in,  and check points to pass through.       On this morning my thoughts take me back to a large  segment of my life when this was my normal routine…planes,  baggage, masses of people, taxies, hotels, conferences, and  corporate retreats.   Hurry, hurry, rush, rush, the goal was to get  to the airport with a minimum of 30 minutes to spare.  My inner  self would say “Ann, sit down, catch your breath, find a cup of  coffee, finish your expense report, and respond to the last nights  memo on sales figures for the month.  Again, a small voice  would emerge from within, and say “When I retire, life will not  present itself with these intensities, responsibilities, and time  restraints.  Life will be simple, yes simple.  Simplicity in  everything I do will be my goal.”       As I have now discovered, retirement is NOT as I  anticipated…slow, peaceful, and without pressures or  responsibilities. Life, for me, is as full or fuller than it has ever  been.  I am now convinced that what I perceived as retirement is  really not retirement at all, but “end of life.”  Well, end of life  will have to wait.  I am very busy.  I have a new, non-paying  job as SHHA President, and I have on the horizon exciting  adventures and challenges.  I will keep my goal of simplicity in  mind, knowing that this is not a task, that is, in any way, simple.   However, as all of you know that attended the Annual Meeting,  the question Kate Fry had to answer was “Where is our new  President, Ann Zimmerman?”       When my holiday has ended, I will return to my routine of A  Perfect Way to Start A Day.                  ANNOUNCEMENTS & NOTICES:    Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.     Board Meeting – Wed, July 11 at the SHHA office, 7pm    Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes, and contractor  evaluation binder free to members.     Committee meetings are posted on our website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.    Classified ads can be found on the website on the top bar  menu under Classifieds.    Safety Vests for sale in the SHHA office. $2 per vest for members.  3   The GRIT – July 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 7                                                                                                      SHHA Special  Event   On Saturday, July 14,  2012 SHHA will present  a very special event  reserved for SHHA  members, and their  guests. This event will be held at the Church of  the Good Shepherd, 7834 Tennyson NE. The  doors will open at 6:30pm and the concert will  start at 7:30pm. This is an RSVP event and  limited to the first 125 members and their  guests. Those attending will be entertained with  the warm and liquid music of Jazz Guitarist,  Greg Ruggiero. Gregg was once a New  Mexican, and now resides in New York City.  His travels have taken him across this country,  as well as internationally. Gregg recently  returned from a tour in Japan and London where  he received rave reviews. If you are an SHHA  member, get your reservations in ASAP by  calling the office at 797-7793.     z  zz  zz  zz  z    Tram Passes  There are 6 corporate tram passes per day!

All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true!   Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Tram passes are among the most  popular member benefits, so be sure you  maintain your membership so your tenants can  experience some of the great “perks” of living  in Sandia Heights!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Next Coffeehouse Concert  Steve Gillette & Cindy Mangsen perform on  Saturday, September 8, at Church of the Good  Shepherd Lower Hall at 7:30 pm.  Steve and Cindy have been performing together  for over 20 years, bringing together their love of  traditional music and their wealth of original  songs. Accompanying themselves with guitars  and concertinas, their live performances are  known for rich harmony, compelling songs and  a good dose of humor. Steve's songs have been  covered by Ian and Sylvia, John Denver, Garth  Brooks, Linda Ronstadt, Tammy Wynette, and  many others. Read more and listen to their  music on www.compassrosemusic.com.

This is not a new issue within  our community, and at times becomes a major  irritant for other residents.  Although the  published covenants for the earliest developed  units do not specifically spell out RVs, the  Second Judicial Court in the late 1990s  determined long-term parking of RVs, camper  trailers and boats on all residential lots in Sandia  Heights is prohibited.  The court allowed  parking of such vehicles for a period of no more  than 48 hours for maintenance and provisioning.     The CSC does not police the neighborhood for  violations, however, if a complaint is received,  your homeowners association and the CSC will  act upon it with the full authority and backing of  the judicial system.  We would ask all residents  with RVs, travel trailers and boats to be good  neighbors and respect the rights of other  residents and adhere to the covenants.  Please  keep in mind that the covenants are here to  ensure we can continue to live in a pristine  community and maintain the value in our  homes.                DON’T DUMP ON YOUR  NEIGHBORS!!!  Recently the CSC has investigated complaints in  which landscaping and construction debris has  been dumped on a neighbor’s property. These  debris piles are usually wheelbarrow quantities  and therefore it is likely that they come from  someone in the neighborhood doing a home  project who dumps the debris on a convenient  “vacant lot”.  Unfortunately, this dumping  ground is someone’s property that is usually in a  state of natural vegetation. The owner of the  property becomes responsible for cleanup even  though the owner did not cause the problem. If  you hire someone to do work around your  house, please be sure that they cart the material  away (not to the end of the street). There are no  public landfills or dumps in Sandia Heights.  Disposal of debris in the arroyos is both illegal  and not in keeping with being a good neighbor.  If you see illegal dumping, please notify the  SHHA  and give as much information as  possible (identity of person, license number,  etc). It is your neighborhood!  Keep an eye out  for such things as illegal dumping.                ACC Tip:  The following article was first  published in the December 2010 GRIT and  again in August 2011. It is well worth reading.   It was written by Jessica Speck of JADE  Enterprises, Inc., a local contractor with many  years of experience in the Albuquerque area for  design and construction of home improvement  projects. I will periodically publish this article  since I continue to hear “horror stories” of  residents here in Sandia Heights being taken  advantage of by unlicensed and uninsured  contractors. Know who you are dealing with and  take advantage of the information in this  article—it may save you lots of headaches and  money!  Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC.    Hire Licensed and Insured  Contractors!   By Jessica Speck    Contracting without a license in the state New  Mexico is against the law. With setbacks in our  current economic conditions, we are all cutting  corners with our spending.  Many homeowners  are choosing to remodel their current homes as  opposed to purchasing new homes, which is  wonderful. But in order to save a little money,  they are choosing to hire inexperienced,  unlicensed, uninsured individuals often  becoming a sizeable liability to the homeowner  and the completed home project. While it seems  reasonable to spend less and find any cost deals  available, this approach has devastated the  home-remodeling industry.  Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – July 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 7                                                                                                      Continued from page 7  Recently there has been a rise of unlicensed  individuals entering the home-remodeling market  with a set of tools, a truck and minor remodeling  skills who have begun delivering bids to the  homeowner at prices too good to be true!   Remember the old adage:  “You get what you pay  for”, it still carries great validity, even in the  home-remodeling industry.  Low-quality material  and workmanship often go unnoticed for months  or even years often times resulting in the cost of  demolition of the poor workmanship and paying  again for a licensed contractor to build what the  “Scope of Work” actually called for.   Unfortunately however, no insurance is one of the  most obvious and devastating ways construction  costs are cut.  This means that if anyone should  fall off the homeowner’s roof, use faulty materials  and methods, or damage the homeowner’s home  or belongings, there is no coverage to protect the  homeowner. In these circumstances, the  unlicensed or uninsured remodeler cannot afford  to pay for the damages leaving the homeowner  with an uncompleted project and large mistakes to  pay for. This can be related to the liability  incurred when we get in a car accident with an  individual who has failed to purchase car  insurance. Who then pays for your personal  injuries, or damages to your car and their car? You  or your insurance company will then be  responsible for the damages.  If you have been a victim of unlicensed  contracting or you would like more information  on the topic, you can visit the New Mexico  Regulation and Licensing department’s  “Construction Industries Division” Web site at:   www.rld.state.nm.us/CID/unlicensed.htm  Note:  When hiring a contractor look for license #,  Liability Coverage, and Workers  Compensation. You may also request a Builders  Risk Policy be taken out on your project.      z  zz  zz  zz  z  ACC Activity Log   Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   1 Juniper Hill Road – Remodel  21 Cedar Hill Road – Deck Repair & Paint  20 Cedar Hill Road – Paint Trim & Garage Door  25 Cedar Hill Place - Landscaping  44 Rock Ridge Court – Wall  147 Whitetail – Reroof & Restucco  334 White Oaks Drive – Deck Replacement  526 Live Oak Place – Remodel  543 Black Bear Loop - Restucco  547 Black Bear Road – Sunroom & HVAC  Replacement  576 Black Bear Road – Window Replacement  584 Black Hawk Drive – Restucco & Windows  647 Cougar Loop – Reroof  656 Roadrunner Lane – Wall & Landscaping,  Reroof & Restucco  726-28 Tramway Vista Loop – Window  Replacement  760-7 Tramway Lane – Garage Door Replacement  821 B Live Oak Road – Garage Door  Replacement  990 Lynx Loop – Patio Floor Replacement  1042 Red Oaks Loop – Resurface Driveway  1104 San Rafael Ave – Fence Replacement   1105 San Rafael – Skylight Installation  1114 San Rafael Ave – Resurface Driveway  1159 Laurel Loop – Window Replacement  1206 Marigold Drive – Partial Roof Repair  1574 Eagle Ridge Court – Paint Stucco  1704 Quail Run Court - Restucco  1708 Quail Run Court – Reroof  1710 Quail Run Court - Reroof  1854 Tramway Terrace – Paint Stucco  1929 Quail Run Drive – Stucco Repair &  Windows  1945 Quail Run Loop – Restucco  2707 Tramway Lane – Partial Roof Repair  2830 Tramway Circle – Landscaping  7722 Cedar Canyon Court – Reroof & Restucco  8208 Indigo Court – Restucco  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to read  about all projects currently under ACC  management.
