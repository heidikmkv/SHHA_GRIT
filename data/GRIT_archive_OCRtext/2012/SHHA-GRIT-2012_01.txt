    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                             January 2012      Sandia Heights Coffeehouse  Concert Series presents…            Syd Masters & the Swing Riders            in Concert Saturday, January 14       Syd Masters & the Swing Riders is a trio  based in Edgewood playing western music-- WESTERN, not country-western. The  band's repertoire is one third vintage music  of old cowboy trail songs, one third western  swing from the 30s, 40s & 50s, and one  third originals. Syd's timeless melody  "Under New Mexico Skies" was given the  honorable title of "Official Cowboy Song of  the State of New Mexico" by former  Governor Bill Richardson.       The New Mexico Music Industry has  presented Syd with awards for "Country  Song of the Year," "Best Vocal  Performance," and "Most Humorous Song."   His 2007 NMMI award for "Vocalist of the  Year" made him the only person to ever win  it twice. Syd has been seen on television  commercials and billboards throughout the  west as spokesman for the Powerball Lottery  Campaign. Listen to his music on  www.sydmasters.com.     This will be an all-ages, alcohol-free  event, presented by the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association Community  Service & Membership Committee  (www.sandiahomeowners.org). General  admission will be $15/adults, $10/teens and  seniors 60+, $5/12 & under, under 5 free.  Admission for SHHA members & their  houseguests will be FREE. Lower Hall  doors will open at 6:30 for MEMBERS  ONLY. Doors will open to the general  public at 7. Admission is at the door only-- no advance tickets-come early for best  seating and enjoy the artwork in the hallway  that artists from Sandia Heights Artists will  be displaying. Complimentary refreshments  will be provided. For more information or to  volunteer to help, contact Linda Bolton,  856-7100/nlightsmgt@aol.com.              President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry    Did you know?       It’s the beginning of the new year, and I  thought it would be a good time to dispel a  few myths and answer some questions that  have come up in the past year. There’s no  theme, and these thoughts are in no  particular order—it’s just an assortment of  things I’ve jotted down over the past several  months. Please call or send an email to the  SHHA office if reading this triggers other  questions!

Security services are provided to Sandia  Heights residents on a subscription basis.  If  you aren’t a subscriber to Sandia Heights  Security, we encourage you to sign up by  calling 856-6419.  It’s an inexpensive way  to have another set of eyes looking out for  your safety and security.    If you call 911 from a cell phone in Sandia  Heights, be sure to say you are in Sandia  Heights and you need the Sheriff’s  Department 911 Dispatch, as Sandia Heights  is located in Bernalillo County but not  within the city limits of Albuquerque.  All  911 calls from cell phones are automatically  routed to Albuquerque Police Department,  so if you don’t ask for the Sheriff’s  Department, you will experience needless  delays in getting help.    The Board cannot change any of the Unit  covenants.  Individual Units retain the sole  right to change their covenants, requiring   the signatures of 75% of the homeowners of  record for the entire Unit.  This means that if  two people are on a home's title, both may  be required to sign the petition to amend the  covenants.  You should check the specific  wording of your Unit covenants if you wish  to amend them.     Every Sandia Heights resident receives the  GRIT, not just SHHA members.  Some  residents think they are members of SHHA  because they receive the GRIT in the mail,  but that isn’t the case.  The GRIT newsletter  is a service SHHA provides to all residents.   If you aren’t a member of SHHA and you’d  like to participate in all our wonderful  membership benefits, contact the SHHA  office to sign up.    If you have a septic system, you may not be  using the right bathroom tissue.  Some of  the super-cushy two- and three-ply tissues  are very slow to disintegrate, which could  cause problems with a septic system.  An  easy way to find out whether your tissue  disintegrates quickly is to put several  squares of tissue in a quart jar, fill it nearly  full of water, put the lid on and shake it for  10-15 seconds.  If the toilet tissue breaks  down into multiple small fragments, it’s a  good brand to use with a septic system.    Even if you aren’t a member of SHHA you  must get ACC approval for any changes to  the exterior appearance of your house.  This  is true even if you plan to restucco your  house in the same color, for example, or  replace windows with the same or very  similar windows.  This is for your  protection, because when someone calls the  SHHA office when they see work being  done, the office staff can explain that the  work is authorized and save you the  inconvenience of an inquiry.  If you are a  member of SHHA, the ACC application fees  will be waived—that’s one of the many  benefits of SHHA membership.    Relocating any wild animal, whether it’s a  bear, a bobcat, a squirrel, or a snake, is  usually no good for the animal.  Animals  removed from their home range and placed  in an unfamiliar environment are vulnerable  to attack by resident animals, and they also  have a hard time finding food and avoiding  predators.  As a result, the survival rate for  relocated animals is quite low. Not only that,  but relocating an animal doesn’t mean your  animal problem is solved.  If your property  has good enough wildlife habitat to support  the animal you removed (and in Sandia  Heights, everything is good wildlife habitat),  it is pretty much guaranteed that another  animal will move in to fill that niche.                                                                 Continued on page 3  The GRIT, January 2012                                                                                                    Page 3  Continued from page 2    If you don’t want raccoons or skunks or  snakes on your property, do what you can to  make the environment inhospitable.  Close  up any holes in your house where animals  may get in.  Make sure there are no animals  inside before you plug the holes.  This is  especially important in spring, when there  are likely to be babies in a nest.  Don’t leave  pet food outside, and keep trash inside the  garage until the morning of trash pickup.  Simple changes to human behavior can keep  wild animals from being perceived as  nuisances.  If you have questions about  coexisting with wildlife, feel free to send me  an email at kfry4956@yahoo.com.    “The cure for boredom is curiosity.  There  is no cure for curiosity.”  –Dorothy Parker    Have a safe and happy new year!                 SHHA POSITION  REGARDING THE COUNTY  LINE RESTAURANT  SUMMER CONCERTS       After considerable deliberation, SHHA  has determined that the summer concerts  sponsored by the County Line Restaurant, in  and of themselves, do not constitute an  annoyance or nuisance as specified in the  Unit 7 covenants.  Because the term  “annoyance or nuisance” is not defined in  the covenants with respect to any objective  standards, the term may be interpreted  subjectively by SHHA and individual  property owners within Sandia Heights. In  the absence of objective standards set forth  in the covenants, courts will interpret the  covenants narrowly in order to preserve the  property owner’s free enjoyment of his or  her property (in this case, the County Line  Restaurant) within the scope of the  covenants.         The Unit 7 covenants permit the use of  the County Line properties for “light  commercial uses as permitted by the zoning  ordinances of Bernalillo County, New  Mexico then in effect, under the zoning  designation C”. Concerns related to  excessive noise, traffic control, adherence to  State laws related to the distribution of  alcoholic beverages, and unruly behavior of  concert attendees fall under the jurisdiction  of the County and State, as appropriate.   SHHA cannot and will not interfere with the  enforcement of these matters.                 YOUR DUES ARE HOW  MUCH?       That’s the question we hear from other  homeowners’ associations in Albuquerque  when they find out the amount of dues paid  by SHHA members. We pay a great deal  less than other neighborhoods but we enjoy  an amazing variety of benefits for such a  small sum. However, expenses such as  office rent, utilities, labor costs, and  insurance costs have risen steadily over the  past several years, and the cost of popular  member benefits like Tram passes have also  increased significantly. For many years we  have continued to provide free Tram passes,  free Coffee House concerts, and Meet &  Greet social events, as well as a fully staffed  office with free copy and fax services, free  notary services, and the ever-cheerful  assistance of Betsy and Sheraz, without  raising the membership dues. In an effort to  continue providing these valuable services  that SHHA members have come to depend  on, we find it necessary to increase our  monthly dues. Effective March 1, 2012,  SHHA membership dues will increase from  $8.00 to $10.00 per month. The last time  dues were raised was approximately ten  years ago, and we know you will understand  and support the need to raise the dues at this  time.

Posting the on-line version is free. The  printed mail GRIT costs the homeowners  over $20,000 per year. The January GRIT  will be e-mailed, randomly, to 200  homeowners. The e-mail attached file will  be a PDF document and can be read by  ADOBE Reader software. If one double  clicks on the e-mail attachment the GRIT  will come up in ADOBE Reader. In the  event one does not have ADOBE Reader  installed on your computer, a free version  will be offered via an internet download.        The aim is to have the homeowners  consider receiving the GRIT electronically.  The advantages besides reducing mailing  and printing costs, are quite attractive: the  electronic version is in color and has useful  internet links to passive and dynamic  internet pages. For example, we can, in the  future, include video and power point  presentations of events of interest to SH  homeowners. Also, the on-line version is  higher resolution compared to the half tone  printed version. The e-mail attached GRIT  can be printed out on one’s printer if one  desires to read a printed copy. We are  interested in homeowner feedback and have  no near term plans to suspend the printed  Mailed GRIT.                 TRAM  PASSES:   There are 6 corporate  tram passes per day!

Not only did he have  extensive knowledge of construction, but he  also knew the impact of covenant enforcement  on both homeowners and their contractors, and  considered both equitably when deliberating on  enforcement issues.  Terry was a learned man  and a great gentleman, and we will miss him  very much.    Summary of ACC articles  published in 2011:         One of my goals as Chairman of the ACC is  to publish articles of interest to homeowners in  Sandia Heights on a variety of topics. As I did  in January of 2011, the following is a review of  articles published in the GRIT during the prior  year.  Please refer to the original articles if you  want to see the entire text of the article. I  sincerely hope that these articles are  informative and helpful. Bob Bower, ACC  Chairman.
