    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                             March 2012      President’s Message   ~ Kate Fry    Whether March comes in like a lion or a  lamb, it still means that spring is on the way.   We’ll probably have a snowstorm or two  just to remind us that this is New Mexico,  but before we know it, the spring winds will  subside and it will be June. Which leads me  to—    An appeal for volunteers for the SHHA  Board and committees. It’s hard to believe,  but the Annual Meeting on June 9 is coming  up fast. Your SHHA Board of Directors is  close to the minimum number of members  needed in order to exist, which is a worrying  position to be in. It also means that the  current Board members are spread pretty  thin doing the business of SHHA. So, if you  have an interest in helping to maintain our  “peak of living” here in Sandia Heights,  please consider volunteering for a position  on the Board. Even if you don’t have  experience volunteering with homeowners’  associations, you are welcome to join us,  and we’ll help you learn the ropes.   Qualifications include a desire to help the  community, time and willingness to work  (yes, being a member of the Board does take  time and requires work!), and ability to work  well with other people. You can pick up a  Statement of Interest at the SHHA office (or  our office staff will cheerfully e-mail a copy  to you). If you don’t have the time to serve  on the Board, we encourage you to volunteer  for one of our committees. You can find a  description of the committees on the SHHA  website in the Residents’ Guide. The  Residents’ Guide is also in the SHHA  Residents’ Directory and Guide. We’re  looking for interested people with ideas and  the time to be an active committee member.   The time commitment varies by committee,  so check them out and talk to the committee  chairs for more details.    And to clear up a misunderstanding  about SHHA committees: Every member  of every SHHA committee has a vote with  regard to committee business. In response to  our appeals for new committee volunteers,  we have heard several residents say that they  don’t see why they should do the work  required on a committee if they can’t vote.   We don’t know how this misconception  came about, but please be assured that it is  not true! Our committee members are the  lifeblood of SHHA, and every committee  member (not just Board members) is entitled  to vote on the business of his or her  committee.    Coming soon-- exciting changes to the  SHHA website! Look for a more colorful,  up-to-date look with lots of photos, easier  navigation, and online forms for ACC  projects and covenant violation complaints.   Our current website has a huge amount of  useful information, and the new site will  have even more information, including trail  maps, wildlife information, an events  calendar, landscaping and gardening  information, and safety information.

These are  just a few of the new features we are  working on to make the new website user- friendly, attractive, and useful.    Cunning coyotes: Recently we have heard  concerns from several residents about  coyotes attacking pets. We don’t know if  there has been an increase in these incidents,  although it is possible that coyotes have  been adversely affected by the drought,  along with other wildlife, and are preying on  pets due to scarcity of their usual prey of  rodents and rabbits. However, it’s more  likely that the coyotes are simply taking  advantage of pets roaming free or left  unattended in back yards. They’re just doing  what comes naturally for a predator, and  that’s hunting for prey wherever they find it.   The answer is not to try to eradicate  coyotes—coyotes are extremely adaptable,  and eradication efforts historically have not  only been unsuccessful, but have caused  populations to expand rather than decline in  response to eradication attempts. It’s our  responsibility to keep our pets safe, not only  from coyotes, but also from bobcats, owls,  and hawks, which will also take unprotected  pets. Here’s how to keep your pets safe and  keep coyotes from becoming a problem.  • Don’t let your pets roam.   • Keep an eye on your dog when it’s  outside in your yard.   • Don’t leave pet food outside.  • Keep your garbage in the garage  until the morning of pickup..  For more information, including what to do  if you meet a coyote, check out “Keeping  Pets Safe” on the SHHA website or pick up  a hard copy in the SHHA office. With a  better understanding of coyotes and their  habitat, people can coexist harmoniously  with these adaptable and cunning animals.                 Wastewater and Septic  Systems Update         As a direct result of the attendance of  more than 50 residents from Sandia Heights  at the January 10, 2012 Bernalillo County  Commission meeting, your District 4  Commissioner, Michael Wiener, was able to  get a 60-day extension to a final vote by the  Commissioners that would amend the  County wastewater ordinance to require  inspection of septic systems on a 5-year  repeating schedule and to upgrade failed  septic systems to meet present code  requirements. This inspection could be done  in conjunction with a normal pumping  operation. Upgrading a failed system could  cost as much as $30,000. The County  maintains a list of registered and certified  septic system evaluators which, in most  cases, are the same contractors that pump  and install septic systems.       The Sandia Heights Wastewater and  Septic Systems Committee met with  Commissioner Wiener (District 4), Special  Assistant to Commissioner Hart Stebbins  (District 3) Wende O’Brien, and others,  including Mr. George Schroeder, Bernalillo  County Environmental Health Manager, on  January 26, 2012. We were especially  concerned about the following actions by the  County: the  haste in seeking to pass  this  amendment without public input; whether or  not there is a need for such an amendment;  the one-size-fits-all approach to all septic  systems in Bernalillo County; the arbitrary  assumption that septic systems on less than  0.75 acre pollute ground water whereas  identical systems on more than 0.75 acre do  not.

Rev. Wiliam D. Ingraham ie Pastor and Teacher  ys  (CHURCH OF THE GooD SHEPHERDUCC  sean bi ert come vce rp  The GRIT  The GRIT, March 2012                                                                                                      Page 7  Continued from page 2          The apparent discrimination against  homeowners who have less than 0.75 acre;  the retraction of the statement in the  Albuquerque Journal that  areas supplied by  a private water utility are exempt from the  inspections; the costs for the inspection of  the septic systems; and the high cost to bring  these systems up to meet present code.         As a direct result of the meeting of  January 26, Mr. George Schroeder mailed a  letter to every homeowner in Bernalillo  County with a septic system on less than  0.75 acre outlining the proposed schedule  for the septic system inspections.  The main argument used by the County,  especially Mr. George Schroeder, is that  Sandia Heights septic systems pollute  ground water downstream, i.e. to the west of  Sandia Heights. This assumption is based on  a 2000 modeling study that predicts nitrate  concentrations of 6 mg/L in the ground  water. EPA and State standards for safe  drinking water are nitrate concentrations of  10 mg/L or less. Actual nitrate  measurements by the County in two test  wells along Tramway Blvd in 2005 and  2008 showed that this projected  accumulation of nitrate was exaggerated.  For a number of years the nitrate  concentration averaged 3 mg/L. More  important, these measured concentrations  did not increase but remained steady at 3  mg/L. Sandia Peak Utility Co., our water  provider, lists a nitrate concentration of less  than 1 mg/L (2010 tests) in our drinking  water. Therefore, there is no proof that  septic systems contaminate ground water in  Sandia Heights or ground water to the west  of us.        We also met on February 6 with  Commissioner Wayne Johnson, District 5,  who represents homeowners in the East  Mountain communities that have the highest  septic system concentration in Bernalillo  County. Apparently these homeowners have  similar concerns about this amendment as do  Sandia Heights residents.       These proposed changes to the Bernalillo  County wastewater ordinance will again be  discussed and will come up for a vote at the  regular Commission meeting on Tuesday,  March 13, 2012, at 5:00 PM  in the Vincent  E. Griego Chambers in the basement of 1  Civic Plaza NW. It is important that Sandia  Heights is again represented by as many  residents as possible.       In the meantime, it is important that we  keep our septic systems functioning  properly. The best way to do this is to have a  regular pumping schedule. Every septic tank  should be pumped every 3 to 5 years.                  Preliminary and Final Design  and Construction Plans ~ Bob  Bower, Chairman, ACC         As I mentioned in my article entitled  “Planning your Home Improvement Project”  published in the October 2011 edition of the  GRIT, the ACC encourages all property  owners of Sandia Heights to submit an  application for preliminary approval of  design and construction plans, particularly  for new construction and major addition  projects.  Preliminary plans are the ones that  are done during the initial stages of the  planning process prior to the preparation of  final (and much more expensive) plans.   Review of plans at the preliminary phase  can identify any problems with governing  Unit covenants or with any of the ACC  Design Guidelines related to the project.   This early review will make it easier to  correct any compliance problems before  incurring further costs as you proceed  towards the preparation of final plans. As a  minimum, these preliminary plans should  contain the floor plans, elevations, and the  location of the proposed structure on the lot.                                         Continued on page 8  The GRIT, March 2012                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7         It is also advisable to include exterior  materials, colors, lighting, etc., if known at the  time. The ACC will point out what can and  cannot be approved based on the completeness  of the preliminary plans.  The applicant will be  encouraged to submit additional information to  address any inadequacies with the initial  submission of the preliminary plans in order to  avoid the risk of later disapproval of the  project.  Once the ACC gives its written  approval of the preliminary plans, you can then  proceed with the preparation of final design and  construction plans.  Two copies of the final  plans should accompany the submittal of  another application for final approval of the  project, and these documents will be used by  the ACC to conduct a neighborhood review of  the project, if needed, prior to the final  approval of the project.                                   Keep in mind that the ACC only requires  final drawings that show the overall floor plan,  the elevations, the location of the proposed  project on the lot, and any other features that  affect the external appearance of the residence.  The ACC does not need drawings showing  such items as internal electrical wiring, etc.,  that are not related to what the external  appearance of the project will look like when  completed.       Once the ACC approves the final plans, you  must keep the ACC fully informed if you make  any changes to these plans, regardless of how  trivial you may think these changes are.  Such  items as changes to an exterior chimney design  or relocating an air conditioning unit from a  ground-mounted location to a location on your  roof or vice-versa need ACC approval if these  changes are not part of the originally approved  plans.  Experience has shown that neighbors  who have examined plans made available to  them during a neighborhood review are  especially sensitive to any changes during  construction that appear to differ from the plans  that they were invited to review.       Just for your reference, the ACC currently  has six Design Guidelines for use by property  owners within Sandia Heights to ensure  covenant compliance and to ensure that  property development within the community  does not unduly interfere with the natural  landscape and homeowners’ visual access to it,  and that the resulting construction is in  harmony with the natural surroundings and  residences in the immediate area.  These  Design Guidelines are available at the SHHA  office and on the SHHA website.  These  Design Guidelines are listed as follows:  •  Detached Buildings  •  Landscaping  •  Roofing  •  Setbacks and Variances  •  Solar Collectors  •  Walls and Fences    z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log: Summary of  Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:     412 Live Oak Loop – Reroof  626 Blackhawk Drive – Landscaping   638 Cougar Loop – Stucco Repairs  725-9 Tramway Lane – Garage Door  Replacement  727-21 Tramway Lane – Replace Retaining  Walls  795 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  810 F Live Oak Road – Fence Replacement  948 Deer Drive – Window Replacement  1049 Red Oaks Loop – Driveway Storm  Abatement  1243 Rockrose Road – Reroof, Restucco, &  Swamp Cooler  1466 Morning Glory – Window Replacement  1504 Eagle Ridge Road – Re-stain Trim   2320 Calle de Gabriel – Reroof  2441 Tramway Terrace Court - Reroof  7710 Cedar Canyon Place – Wall-in windows &  Paint Stucco  8248 Raintree Drive – Repaint House & Walls    z  zz  zz  zz  z  INTRODUCING  THINK YOUR Was  oe 2  RE-  rn HKOOM.

Dues increase SHHA members pay a great deal less than other neighborhoods but we enjoy an  amazing variety of benefits for such a small sum. However, expenses such as office rent, utilities,  labor costs, and insurance costs have risen steadily over the past several years, and the cost of  popular member benefits like Tram passes have also increased significantly. For many years we have  continued to provide free Tram passes, free Coffee House concerts, and Meet & Greet social events,  as well as a fully staffed office with free copy and fax services, free notary services, and the ever- cheerful assistance of Betsy and Sheraz, without raising the membership dues. In an effort to  continue providing these valuable services that SHHA members have come to depend on, we find it  necessary to increase our monthly dues. Effective March 1, 2012, SHHA membership dues will  increase from $8.00 to $10.00 per month. The last time dues were raised was approximately ten years  ago, and we know you will understand and support the need to raise the dues at this time.
