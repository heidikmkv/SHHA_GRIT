This is your chance to see “up close” what your  SHHA Board of Directors has done for you, our  members, during the year, and to share your  concerns with us in a Town Hall setting.  I look  forward to seeing you there!    Website Redesign  I mentioned a few months ago that we were in  the planning stages of revamping the SHHA  website.  I’m happy to tell you that we are now  actively working on the new and improved site.   You can look forward to even more useful and  interesting information, photos, easier  navigation, and new features like an interactive  calendar and online forms.  Join us at the Annual  Meeting to get a preview of our exciting new  website!    neigh·bor·ly     [ney-ber-lee]   adjective  having or showing qualities befitting a congenial  neighbor;  friendly.    I got to thinking about this word as I was  reflecting on my 15 months as your SHHA  President.  Over the months, talking to Sandia  Heights residents about many different topics, I  started to see a pattern having to do with  neighborliness.  As I have written before, there  are many wonderful benefits of living in Sandia  Heights, and one that people especially value is  a sense of community.  I’ve heard many stories  about people getting to know their neighbors,  finding new friends among them, and helping  each other out in different ways.  I have also,  sadly, heard stories about neighbors who don’t  get along so well, leading to tension and  unhappiness. In many cases it seems this tension  develops because neighbors don’t know each  other. It’s really not surprising that we don’t  know our neighbors—we work all day, we  spend a lot of time indoors watching TV or  interacting with our computers, and our natural  landscaping means we don’t have a lot of yard  work to do. Many of us have walled yards, so  even when we’re outside we don’t see anyone  else. In fact, the mail carrier probably knows our  neighbors better than we do!

Continued from Front Page  Now that it’s summer and the weather is so beautiful it draws us  outside, it seems like a good time to try doing some neighborly  things.  If you already get along with your neighbors, it will  only enhance your relationship and benefit your immediate  community.  If there’s tension between neighbors, it might help  create a friendlier atmosphere.  It can’t hurt!  Wave and say  hello when you see each other—we’re all busy, and it’s easy to  get preoccupied and forget to acknowledge our neighbors.   Sometimes that preoccupation can be misunderstood as  standoffishness. Take another step and introduce yourself to a  neighbor you don’t know, and maybe invite them to your house  for coffee.  If your neighbor is at work all day, retrieve their  empty trash container and put it near the garage.  Offer to pick  up their mail and newspaper if they’re going to be out of town,  and keep an eye on each other’s houses. Organize a block  party—it doesn’t have to be formal.  Get everyone together at  someone’s house or yard one afternoon and let everyone bring  snacks.  It’s little things like these that build a sense of  community and increase neighborhood security.  By putting  forth a little effort to think of neighborly things to do, we can  help keep Sandia Heights a desirable place to live.    New President  I will be stepping down as your President after the Annual  Meeting, and handing the reins to Ann Zimmerman.  Ann has  been on the SHHA Board for the past year and has brought a lot  of energy to the Board and to SHHA activities.  She has  extensive experience both as a Board member and as an officer  of other homeowners’ associations, and we welcome her  experience and insights.  She will continue to lead SHHA  toward positive goals for the benefit of the entire community.    My thanks go out to our enthusiastic and dedicated Board, to  our incredible office staff Betsy and Sheraz, and to you, the  members of SHHA, for your loyal support and for making my  tenure so interesting and gratifying.  We have dealt with some  difficult issues and we have accomplished some beneficial  changes, and I’m confident that SHHA will continue to serve  the community well.      Even though I’m leaving the Board, I will continue to work for  the betterment of Sandia Heights behind the scenes.  Look for  articles in the GRIT about various topics, and expanded  information on our website about wildlife and landscaping.   Thanks again to you all—it has been an amazing and  enlightening time!    3   The GRIT – June 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 6                                                                                                      z  zz  zz  zz  z    SHHA SECRETARY ~ Sarah Pirkl    The proposed amendment to the bylaws is  available on the website. We will vote on that at  the annual meeting scheduled for Saturday, June  9, 2012. If you have any questions regarding the  proposed amendment please contact the office.      z  zz  zz  zz  z    COUNTY LINE CONCERTS  UPDATE APRIL 2012  On April 13, 2012, Bernalillo County Metro  Court heard the case brought by Bernalillo  County against the County Line Restaurant for  noise and zoning violations.  The Court ordered  the parties to participate in mediation to begin  approximately May 1.  We will continue to  provide updates as events develop.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Tram Passes:  There are 6 corporate tram passes per day!  Please call the SHHA office at 797-7793 or visit  our website for details:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.     z  zz  zz  zz  z    SHHA membership Cards  Check out the entire SHHA Member Benefits  Program at sandiahomeowners.org and enjoy  discounts at our supporting local merchants.

All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true!   Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Tram passes are among the most  popular member benefits, so be sure you  maintain your membership so your tenants can  experience some of the great “perks” of living  in Sandia Heights!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    SHHA Special Event   On July 14, 2012 SHHA  will present a very special  event reserved for SHHA  members, and their guests.  This event will be held at  the Church of the Good  Shepherd, 7834 Tennyson NE. This is an RSVP  event and limited to the first 125 members and  their guests. Those attending will be entertained  with the warm and liquid music of Jazz  Guitarist, Greg Ruggiero. Gregg was once a  New Mexican, and now resides in New York  City. His travels have taken him across this  country, as well as internationally. Gregg  recently returned from a tour in Japan and  London where he received rave reviews. If you  are an SHHA member, get your reservations in  ASAP by calling the office at 797-7793.     z  zz  zz  zz  z    4   The GRIT – June 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 6                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:   Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services including water, trash and security is a  subscription service separate from Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

Beginning in August 2012, all Sandia Heights  Services sanitation customers will be receiving  new collection bins for the removal of all solid  waste materials at no cost to our customers.  Additionally, we will make available at no cost  to our customers new recycle bins for those  residents who wish to participate in our curbside  recycling program.   In an effort to improve our  neighborhood and increase sanitary conditions,  effective September 1, 2012, loose bags of trash  will no longer be accepted for pickup – all trash  and recyclables must be placed in the bins  provided by Sandia Heights Services. Also  effective September 1, 2012, a new rate  structure will be in effect, and depending on  what options you select for your collection bin,  you may be able to reduce your monthly rate.      Sandia Heights customers will be mailed an  informational letter in the May and June billing  statements which includes an order form with  options to choose from. The form and other  pertinent information is also available on our  website at www.sandiaheightsservices.com.

If you have lived in  Sandia Heights for any  length of time, you’re uncomfortably familiar  with our gnat population. When the gnats are at  their worst, outdoor activities become  increasingly unpleasant as the gnats swarm  around us and dive into eyes, ears and noses.  Thankfully, there appears to be a solution to the  problem that in environmentally safe and  nontoxic to humans and pets. Cedar oil, which is  extracted from the bark of cedar trees, is a safe  and natural insect repellent that is effective  against gnats. Several companies make cedar  based insect repellents for the yard, and we have  heard reports from a number of residents that  these products do a good job of keeping the  gnats at bay. Two companies we have heard  good reviews about are Cedarcide Industries,  Inc. (www.cedarcide.com) and Greenbug All  Natural Pest Control Products  (www.greenbugallnatural.com). These  companies also make repellents for use by  people and pets.                The ACC, The Covenants, and You ~   Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC             As most of you know, the ACC derives its  authority from the covenants of all SHHA units.   Residents of Sandia Heights, whether members  or non-members of SHHA, must apply to the  ACC for approval of all plans for construction  and major landscaping or for any other changes  that will affect the exterior appearance of the  residence.  This approval must be received prior  to the actual start of the project.  The project  application forms are available at the SHHA  office or online at sandiahomeowners.org and  are easy to fill out.  If needed, the SHHA office  staff will assist you with these applications.       Over the past couple of years, I’ve written  several GRIT articles explaining just how the  ACC processes your applications.  A large  percentage of the applications that are submitted  can be administratively approved within a few  days.  These applications typically involve  routine tasks such as replacing a roof,  restuccoing a residence, replacing windows,  resurfacing a driveway, etc., that don’t need the  review and oversight of the whole Committee.   As Chairman, I review each and every one of  these applications to ensure covenant  compliance.  Applications involving major  construction or landscaping efforts, on the other  hand, will involve the entire Committee in the  review process and the approval of these  applications may take several weeks depending  on their complexity.  The ACC tries its best to  render an approval for these major projects  within 30 calendar days.       The ACC, like the Covenant Support  Committee (CSC), does not have the volunteer  manpower to patrol throughout the entire area of  Sandia Heights and its approximately 2200  individual residences.  The ACC and the CSC  have both developed procedures that depend on  residents to report violations of the covenants.   Occasionally, however, the ACC does receive a  complaint from one or more of our residents  concerning an on-going effort within the  community that appears not to have undergone  any sort of ACC application and subsequent  approval process. These situations cause a great  deal of hardship, not only for the SHHA and  ACC personnel, but also for the offending  resident.  The ACC does have some tools at its  disposal to resolve these types of situations.   The easiest solution is to request the submittal  of an after-the-fact application for the on-going  work, particularly if the work involves relatively  minor changes to the property that have a  negligible impact on the applicable unit  covenants or on neighboring properties.  For  unapproved activities that are creating or have  created a major impact on neighboring  properties, the ACC can issue a stop-work order  or, if necessary, obtain a court-ordered  temporary restraining order.       Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – June 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 6                                                                                                      Continued from page 7       The ACC can and will use any of these tools  to enforce our covenants, so don’t be surprised  if you are the recipient of one of these  instruments if you elect to try to circumvent the  ACC approval process.       I must admit that since I have been involved  with the ACC both as a project manager and as  its chairman, I am most impressed with the  overall cooperation of this community in its  adherence to the requirements dictated by our  covenants relative to the ACC.  On occasion, we  do encounter some challenges now and then, but  the majority of these cases have been solved  amicably.  I ask that you continue to honor your  covenants and know that your ACC is here to  help you with any and all of your efforts to  modify and upgrade your residences while at the  same time ensuring that these activities fall  within the scope of the applicable covenants.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   1 Juniper Hill Loop – Roof Repair  51 Rock Ridge Drive – Reroof  59 Juniper Hill Court – Solar Panels  123 Juniper Hill Road – Restucco  192 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Restucco & Trim  347 Paintbrush Drive – Reroof  375 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Landscaping  379 Juniper Hill Road – Window Replacement  420 Live Oak Court - Wall  619 Cedar Hill Road – Sidewalk Replacement  & Stucco Wall  628 Cougar Loop – Replace Fence  640 Cougar Loop – Reroof & Stucco Repair  645 Cougar Loop – Fence Replacement  804 Tramway Lane – Garage Roof and Parapet  Repair  805 Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  821-A Live Oak Road – Resurface Driveway  879 Tramway Lane Court – Miscellaneous  Projects  958 Antelope Ave - Reroof  959 Antelope Ave – Mailbox Replacement  990 Lynx Loop – Driveway & Deck  Replacement  1024 Tramway Lane – Windows and Doors  Replacement  1105 San Rafael Ave – Windows and Door  Replacement  1216 Rockrose Road – Window Replacement  1415 San Rafael Avenue – Restucco  1431 Honeysuckle Drive – Garage Addition  1465 Bluebell Drive – Restucco  1553 Eagle Ridge Lane – Roof Repair  1843 Tramway Terrace Loop – Restucco  1919 Quail Run Drive – Window Replacement  2302 Calle De Rafael – Window Replacement  2307 Calle De Rafael – Restucco  2317 Calle De Rafael - Landscaping  2526 Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof  2704 Tramway Circle – Reroof   2881 Tramway Place – Parapet repair  7730 Cedar Canyon Road – Reroof  7110 Lynx Loop – Solar Panels  12614 Colony Place – Window Replacement  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Tip:  Always check with your  subcontractor (be it landscaper, window  replacement, remodeler, etc.) that they are  bonded and insured before you hire them on.

It’s Bear Season—Help Keep Them Wild!   Last summer we saw an unusually large number of bears in Sandia Heights because their natural food  supply had been wiped out by the harsh winter and a late spring freeze. This summer we’ll probably see  only a few bears, partly because of a better food supply. The other reason is sobering—it’s because NM  Game and Fish has either killed or relocated most, if not all, of our Sandia bears.  Last year they trapped  and removed 27 bears from the Sandias, and in 2010 the number was 18.  That’s 45 bears gone from the  Sandias, out of an estimated population of only about 50. So it’s up to us to protect our remaining bears  by putting trash outside only on the morning of pickup, bringing bird feeders inside and night (or not  feeding birds until mid-November), storing bird seed and pet food indoors, keeping doors and windows  closed after dark, and harvesting fruit as it ripens. You can pick up a fact sheet about coexisting with  bears in the SHHA office, or check it out on the SHHA website. If you do see a bear, leave it alone. If  there’s nothing on your property to attract them, they won’t stick around. NM Game and Fish has issued  instructions that we should call them ONLY if a bear is trying to get into our house or appears  aggressive. Bears are an important part of our ecosystem, and it would be a shame if there were no bears  in the Sandias.  Only people can prevent bear problems--please do your part to help protect our few  remaining bears!    Community Event Bulletin Board  Not all of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
