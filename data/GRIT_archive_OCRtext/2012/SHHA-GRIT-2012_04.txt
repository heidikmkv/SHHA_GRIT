    Sandia Heights Homeowners Association                                             April 2012      Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert  Series presents…    Jack Williams in concert      Church of the Good Shepherd,   7834 Tennyson NE  Saturday, April 14, 7:30 p.m.         The music of Jack Williams, rooted in  his native South Carolina, is shaped by a 51- year career of playing folk, rock, jazz, R&B,  classical, and the popular music of the 30s,  40s and 50s. From 1958 through 1988, along  with playing jazz (trumpet) and classical  guitar, Jack was best known as an electric  guitarist in a series of original rock bands  and smaller acoustic ensembles. In the late  60's, he gave in to his troubadour nature and  began performing solo--singing and playing  guitar and touring from coast to coast.       "… his artistry… is nothing short of  amazing. Dazzling picking, expressive  voice, unique and interesting songs. He is a  showman in the best sense of the word and  just wowed our audience. I think they would  have followed him anywhere."—Rich  Warren, WFMT "Midnight Special",  Chicago IL        “…the best guitar player I’ve ever  heard…”—Peter Yarrow (Peter, Paul &  Mary)       Read more about Jack and listen to his  music on www.jackwilliamsmusic.com.       This will be an all-ages, alcohol-free  event, presented by the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association Community  Service & Membership Committee  (www.sandiahomeowners.org). General  admission will be $15/adults, $10/teens and  seniors 60+, $5/12 & under, under 5 free.  Admission for SHHA members & their  houseguests will be FREE. Lower Hall  doors will open at 6:30 for MEMBERS  ONLY. Doors will open to the general  public at 7. Admission is at the door only-- no advance tickets. Complimentary  refreshments will be provided.

There are about 40 different Units  within the Sandia Heights community, and  no two sets of covenants are exactly the  same. This diversity in our covenants makes  community-wide enforcement difficult at  best. In addition, the CSC does not have the  volunteer manpower to patrol throughout  Sandia Heights looking for covenant  violations. As such, the CSC has developed  procedures that depend on members of the  SHHA to report covenant violations.    Who can report a violation? First of  all, you must be a property owner in Sandia  Heights and be a member of SHHA in order  to submit a covenant violation form. This  form (Report of Suspected Covenant  Violation) is available at the SHHA office  and from the SHHA website. Your  anonymity as the complainant will be  shielded unless future court action requires  that your identity be revealed. Historically,  court actions of this nature are very rare.   Any SHHA member may submit a covenant  violation form, however, the CSC normally  will act on submissions from residents in the  same Unit where the violation exists, in an  adjacent Unit, or in direct line of sight of the  violation regardless of the Unit you reside  in. The CSC will exercise its discretion as to  whether or not to act on violations outside of  the normal guidelines.    What information is needed on the  violation form? Information regarding you  as the complainant is on the form since the  CSC may want to contact you for additional  details related to your complaint. The  specific violation and its location need to be  identified, along with the rationale  supporting your belief that a violation has  occurred. It also helps to identify the  specific paragraph in the applicable Unit  covenants that you think is being violated.   The form asks if you have contacted the  violator, but this contact is not a requirement  in order to submit the form. The CSC is very  sensitive about not creating an adversarial  relationship between the complainant and  the violator. You may choose to talk to your  neighbor to try to resolve the violation first,  but as stated previously, the CSC does not  require this one-on-one contact. The  last  item required is your signature on the form.  You may also submit the form electronically  and the SHHA staff will consider the email  to be an electronic signature as long as the  email identifies the name of the  complainant. The CSC will not respond to  complaints submitted by phone calls, notes,  or anonymously.    How does the CSC handle the  complaint? A member of the CSC will be  assigned to investigate the complaint and to  try to resolve it. The member first assesses  the validity of the complaint by verifying the  information submitted on the violation form.  If the complaint is deemed invalid, the  complainant will be notified by mail and the  file will be closed.  If it is clear that a valid  violation exists, the member will contact the  alleged violator either in person, by phone,  or by mail and complete an investigative  report. The violator will receive written  notification from the CSC regarding the  specific violation and will be given a  reasonable deadline by which to remedy it.  The member will follow up with the violator  to ensure that the violation is corrected in  accordance with the stated timeline. If the  violation is successfully resolved at this  point, both parties will be notified by mail  and the file will be closed.

The juniper pollen has  settled down and we’re not sneezing as  much, and plants are starting to grow-- especially the weeds (sigh).  Birds are  nesting, animals are giving birth to their  young, and lizards and snakes are emerging  from their winter hibernation.  SNAKES?   Sandia Heights residents have mixed  feelings about snakes—some people like  them and some people don’t.  So I’d like to  speak in defense of snakes.   I hope to help  folks see snakes in a different light.       Humans seem to be hard-wired to be  afraid of snakes, even if they have never  seen a snake.  Living in Sandia Heights, we  share habitat with several kinds of snakes,  the most common of which are bull snakes  (also called gopher snakes) and rattlesnakes.   Only the rattlesnake is venomous, but all  snakes are vital to controlling the rodent  population.   So please try to see snakes as  friendly.  All right, I can hear the reaction  already!  If you can’t bring yourself to like  snakes, at least leave them alone and think  about how many more mice would be trying  to get into your house without them.   Understandably, you may not want a  rattlesnake taking up residence outside your  back door.  If this happens to you, Sandia  Heights Security will be happy to remove it  and bring it to my house.  Just kidding!        I’m going to talk only about rattlesnakes  and bull snakes here, because bull snakes are  most often mistaken for rattlesnakes.   Rattlesnakes and bull snakes have similar  coloring, with black and brown markings on  their backs.  This is no accident.  Bull  snakes try very hard to look and act like  rattlesnakes.  When threatened, they will  coil and raise their heads, hiss, and rustle  their tails in dry leaves to mimic a rattle.   However, they are nonvenomous  constrictors that kill their prey by squeezing,  and they pose no threat to humans or pets.   One foolproof distinction is the shape of the  pupils of the eyes (rattlesnakes have vertical,  football-shaped pupils and bull snakes have  round pupils), but most people don’t want to  get anywhere near close enough to tell the  difference that way!  The easiest way to tell  the difference is to look at the head:  a  rattlesnake has a distinctly triangular head  with pronounced eye ridges and a neck that  is narrower than the head, while a bull  snake’s head is roughly cylindrical and the  same diameter as its neck.  The other  obvious difference is the body shape.          Rattlesnakes are larger in diameter  relative to their length and are fattest in the  middle of the body, with a blunt tail ending  in several rattles in adult snakes.  Bull  snakes are more or less the same diameter  the entire length of their body.  A five-foot- long rattlesnake may be three or four inches  in diameter in the middle of its body, while a  five-foot-long bull snake is probably about  an inch and a half in diameter.  These photos  show the differences very clearly:    Bull snake (gopher snake), Pituophis catenifer   (photo by Colorado State University)                The GRIT, April 2012                                                                                                              Insert    Bull Snake and Curious Cat (photo by Kate Fry)        Western diamondback rattlesnake,  Crotalus  atrox (photo by Arizona Sonora Desert Museum)         Both bull snakes and rattlesnakes are shy  and will try to avoid people.  They usually  know you’re approaching from the ground  vibration, and given the chance they will  usually crawl away.  They won’t chase you!   If you see a snake, it’s probably stretched  out on the pavement or on a sunny trail  catching rays.  Snakes are reptiles, and the  only way they can regulate their body  temperature is by moving to a warm area  (like sun-warmed asphalt) to get warm and  to a cool area (under a tree or in the shade of  a rock) to cool off.  This affinity for getting  warm by stretching out on pavement gets  many snakes killed by cars, when drivers  don’t see them in time to stop.            Unfortunately, some people go out of  their way to run over snakes.  Please don’t  let this be you!  If you see a snake basking  on the road, try to drive around it.  If you  encounter a snake while walking on the trail  (or on the road, for that matter), you can  jump up and down or stomp your feet to  create vibrations that the snake will feel.   Then just wait until the snake moves away.   But if a rattlesnake responds by coiling and  rattling, it’s best to take a detour!       Growing up in Albuquerque in a family  that loved hiking and camping, I learned  very early (thankfully not the hard way)  “Never put your hands or feet any place you  can’t see”.   If you follow this advice, you  won’t step on a rattlesnake and you won’t  get bitten.         In the unlikely event you are bitten, don’t  panic!  Call 911 and keep the bite area lower  than your heart to slow the spread of venom.   Snakebite kits are useless and may even  make things worse.  Rattlesnake venom is a  potent toxin that kills nerves and tissue, so  the best thing you can do is to get to a  hospital as quickly as possible where you  can get antivenin.  Dogs sometimes get  bitten because they are curious and will put  their face right up to a snake to see what it  is.  If this happens, get the dog to the  veterinarian as fast as you can.  It’s another  good reason to keep dogs on leash when you  walk them on the streets or on trails.       If you see a snake near your house,  please please leave it alone.  You’ll  probably never see it again.  Rest assured it  will gobble up mice and other rodents and  keep the population under control. There’s  never a good reason to kill a snake—they  are an essential part of our wildlife habitat.   Feel free to email me at  kfry4956@yahoo.com if you have questions  about snakes or other wildlife!  The GRIT, April 2012                                                                                                      Page 7  Continued from page 2    If, however, the violation is not resolved as a  result of the first letter, a second letter will  be sent to the violator with an additional  timeline for resolution and a warning that  failure to comply may result in legal action.  If the second letter is unsuccessful in solving  the violation, the file will be turned over to  the SHHA attorney for further action. Don’t  put yourself in this latter position by  disregarding these letters—it’s expensive for  both you and the community to pursue legal  action!    Why should you care about covenant  enforcement? Resident surveys conducted  over the years have consistently indicated  that the primary goal of SHHA should be the  enforcement of our covenants. The  covenants were designed to benefit all  property owners in Sandia Heights in order  to preserve and maintain the beauty, quality  of life, and property values in this unique  community. The SHHA and the CSC  actively seek your support for the  enforcement of our covenants. This is your  community and your covenants—take them  seriously!                Letter to the Editor       This is a reminder to drivers to please  look both ways when crossing the  pedestrian/bicycle trail.  Drivers turning  right onto Tramway typically watch over  their left shoulders and often ignore joggers  and bicyclists crossing the intersection from  the north.  I ride the trail every day and I  have noticed that the side street crossings  are very hazardous. Even if pedestrians and  bicyclists cross at the "walk" signal they  must be alert for drivers making an  impulsive right-hand turn.

A neighborhood review is conducted for  the primary purpose of informing neighbors  of a proposed project in their immediate  vicinity once the ACC arrives at the point  where it has determined that the project is in  compliance with applicable covenants and  that it is now ready to approve the project.   A neighborhood review will not be  conducted for a project that the ACC has no  intention of approving.  It has been my  experience that about 10% of the nearly 300  projects that the ACC reviews each year go  through the neighborhood review process.   This 10% consists primarily of new home  construction or significant additions to  existing homes. The term “significant  additions” also includes major landscaping  efforts and changes to prominent features  such as walls and fences.  The decision to  conduct one of these reviews is made when  the ACC feels that the project may have an  impact on the views, harmony, property  values, or interests of the owners of nearby  properties.       Once the ACC decides that a  neighborhood review is appropriate for a  given project, the following steps occur:  1.   A notification letter is sent to neighbors  in the immediate vicinity of the proposed  project. The letter describes the project  and advises addressees that they have ten  working days to visit the SHHA office to  review the project plans   Continued on page 8  The GRIT, April 2012                                                                                                         Page 8  Continued from page 7        and to respond in writing with relevant  comments.  These plans normally consist of  a plot plan showing the footprint of the  project on the property, a basic floor plan,  elevation drawings, and samples of, or  specifications for, exterior materials, colors,  and finishes. The ACC does not require  plans showing interior features such as  electrical circuitry, etc., since the ACC is  only concerned with changes that affect the  external appearance of a residence.  2.   Once all comments are received, the ACC  will provide feedback to the project  applicant and work with the applicant to  address the comments that both the ACC  and the applicant feel could enhance the  project from a neighborhood point of view.  3.   If the ACC feels that the comments  expressed during the review process  indicate that there is a general feeling of  uneasiness within the neighborhood  concerning the project, the ACC may  schedule a neighborhood review meeting to  allow neighbors to meet with the ACC.  4.  Once the ACC has received all comments  from the neighborhood review and from  any subsequent neighborhood meetings, the  ACC will consider all of these comments  before making a final approval decision.   Along with general conditions stated in all  ACC approval letters, specific conditions  stemming from relevant comments obtained  from the neighborhood review will be  incorporated, as appropriate, in the approval  letter.       The neighborhood review process is the  product of many years of experience in dealing  with the community’s need to continually  build, update, and modify its residences.  The  ACC was established by the covenants at their  inception to provide overall guidance to the  property owners and to maintain reasonable  control of the various architectural standards  imposed by these covenants.  In the beginning,  there was no such “animal” as the  neighborhood review and it quickly became  obvious that this sort of review process was  important in order to consider the impact of a  construction project from the neighborhood’s  point of view.  The ACC continues to strongly  endorse the value of the neighborhood review  as a key ingredient in its evaluation process and  I encourage all recipients of a neighborhood  review notification to take a few moments to  review the material available to you for your  review and to submit comments as appropriate.   Don’t miss this opportunity and then regret that  you did not take the time to voice your  concerns once the project is underway!      z  zz  zz  zz  z  ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   11 Eagle Nest – Window installation  36 Sandia Heights Drive – Carport Enclosure  43 Rock Ridge Drive – Repaint Stucco  638 Cougar Loop – Reroof  726-4 Tramway Vista Place – Reroof  727-15 Cedar Hill Court – Install Portal  785 Tramway Lane – Signage  810 Tramway Lane - Landscaping  963 Antelope – Deck Railing Replacement  1062 Red Oaks Loop – Parapet Repair  1135 Marigold – Re-roof  1162 Laurel Loop – Roof Repair  1231 Goldenrod – Gate Replacement  1470 Morning Glory Road – Gate  1835 Tramway Terrace Loop - Reroof  1865 Tramway Terrace Loop – New Fence &  Gates  1866 Tramway Terrace Loop – Roof Repair  2103 Navajo Willow Drive – Restucco  2452 Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof  2897 Tramway Place – Fence Replacement  7710 Cedar Canyon Place - Landscaping  9104 Lynx Loop – Extend and Install Solar  Panels  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.
