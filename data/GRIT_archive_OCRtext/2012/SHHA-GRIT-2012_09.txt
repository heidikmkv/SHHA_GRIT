All kinds of garbage!  In my  youth garbage was simply garbage, synonymous  with trash.   “Ann, take the garbage out” or  “Ann take the trash out.”  In my home, the only  one exception made between trash and garbage  was peanut butter jars, and jelly jars.  They were  to be saved, and we dare not throw away either  of these items.    Garbage or trash today is now referred to as  waste, and waste has become a very  sophisticated term.  There is recycled waste,  green waste, biodegradable waste, hazardous  waste, bio-medical waste, special hazardous  waste, and glass.  Glass is in a category of its  own.  In some communities, glass is a recycled  household waste, and in others it is placed in the  regular household waste container.    The waste revolution for me began evolving 58  years ago when I could return a coke bottle to  Smith’s Grocery Store, and in return put 2 cents  in the pocket of my jeans.

Continued from Front Page    I had no idea that this was recycling.  What I did know was if I  collected 13 coke bottles, I could afford to go to the movies on  both days, Saturday and Sunday.  I had increased my allowance  by 26 cents, over a 100% increase.  It never occurred to me that  I was helping any cause but my own.  Helping the environment,  by not filling the landfill with bottles, was not on my radar.     It is now apparent that we must all consciously be aware of  how we properly dispose of our waste.  For our children, and  grandchildren, sorting waste is a natural and repetitive habit.      In our household, we are getting better with this task, and we  will become experts soon, as the demand on us becomes greater  and greater. We are anxiously awaiting our new recycle bin.        Sandia Heights Services and SHHA reminds us to:      Put your waste out, the morning of your scheduled pick up.  Please do not leave your household waste out overnight.  We  do have wild animals in our area, and our waste is very  hazardous to the bears.     Return your waste containers to their proper secluded area after  the pickup.  Thank you.                         z  zz  zz  zz  z    Announcements & Notices:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.    Board Meeting – Wed, September 12, at the SHHA office,  7pm   Coffeehouse Concert: Saturday, September 8 at Church of  the Good Shepherd 7:30pm   Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes, email alerts and  contractor evaluation binder free to members.    Committee meetings are posted on our website:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.   Classified ads can be found on the website on the top bar  menu under Classifieds.    Safety Vests for sale in the SHHA office.  $2 per vest for members.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    New on the Website!

The  SHHA Merchant Benefits Program includes the  following current participating merchants:     Asian Café - Bair Medical Spa - Best Way  Carpet - Bob's Painting - Black Diamond  Taekwondo - Chiropractor, Mark L.

All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true! Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience  some of the great “perks” of living in Sandia  Heights!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Printed GRIT and E-mail Alerts  Now Members-Only!    Until now, SHHA policy has been to mail the  GRIT to all residents, both members and non- members. Due to the rising costs associated  with printing the GRIT, and as a result of  evaluating the benefits of membership, after  October we will no longer be mailing the GRIT  to non-members. If you would like to continue  receiving the GRIT in the mail, now is the time  to sign up for SHHA membership. At only $10  a month, it’s a great bargain. If you take  advantage of our most popular benefit—free  Tram passes, a value of $20 per ticket— membership pays for itself very quickly. Add  the other benefits of free notary services, free  copy and fax services, free Coffeehouse  Concerts, the Speaker Series, Easter Egg Hunt,  Visit Santa Claus, and discounts at many local  businesses, and your $10 monthly dues is a very  worthwhile investment.    Another benefit that will now be available only  to members is our E-mail Alert service. When  you sign up for this service, SHHA will notify  you by e-mail of burglaries in your  neighborhood and other security alerts, fire  alerts, wildlife alerts, and other important  information that you need to know quickly.  Much of this information comes directly from  Bernalillo County sources, and it’s a great way  to receive information in a timely manner.  If  you want to continue receiving e-mail alerts,  sign up for SHHA membership today!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    4   The GRIT – September 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 9                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:   Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

If you did not place your order by June 22, you will be  receiving one 96 gallon trash bin. We will begin accepting change and additional trash and  recycle bin orders on September 10, 2012 via email at customerservice@sandiapeak.com.   During the month of September, the change fee of $20 will be waived for those customers who  need to change their bin size.  For those of you who want to dispose of your existing trash bins, we  will collect them during the first two weeks of September on your regular collection day. Please  make sure the old bins are empty, as we will only collect trash in the new bins provided to you.       As a reminder, the trash bin will have the dark brown lid, and the recycle bin will have the green lid.   All trash must be bagged within the trash bin, but the recyclables must be placed loose in the  bin, not bagged.  We will no longer accept loose bags of trash or recycling, they all must be  contained in the appropriate trash or recycle bin.  For those instances when you have additional  uncontained trash or appliances, furniture, etc., we will continue to offer the special pickup  service on Mondays for a minimum charge of $20.  Additional charges may apply depending on  what you have for collection. We also offer additional 96 gallon bins at $4.50 per month or 64 gallon  bins at $3.50 per month.  Simply contact our office at 856-6419 to schedule the special pickup when  you need the service.    Thank you for your cooperation and support during the implementation of this new service!   We are proud that over seventy percent of our neighborhood has voluntarily chosen to recycle.

The SHHA covenants clearly place the authority  and responsibility to approve or disapprove  project applications with the ACC and not with  owners in close proximity to the subject  property. The covenants do not require the ACC  to conduct neighborhood reviews prior to  approval of any of its projects. A neighborhood  review is conducted as a courtesy to the  community and for the primary purpose of  informing neighbors of a proposed project in  their immediate vicinity once the ACC arrives at  the point where it has determined that the  project is in compliance with applicable  covenants and that it is now ready to consider  the approval of the project.  The decision to  conduct a neighborhood review is made when  the ACC feels that the project may have an  impact on the views, harmony, property values,  or interests of the owners of nearby properties.  The ACC will strive to ensure that property  development does not unduly interfere with the  natural landscape and homeowners’ access to it,  and that the resulting construction is in harmony  with the natural surroundings and residences in  the immediate area.    Once the ACC decides that a neighborhood  review is appropriate for a given project, the  following steps occur:  1.  A notification letter is sent to neighbors in  the immediate vicinity of the proposed  project. The letter describes the project and  advises addressees that they have seven  working days to visit the SHHA office to  review the project plans and to respond in  writing with relevant comments.  These  plans normally consist of a plot plan  showing the footprint of the project on the  property, a basic floor plan, elevation  drawings, and samples of, or specifications  for, exterior materials, colors, and finishes.   Please note that if you learn of an on-going  neighborhood review of a property in your  neighborhood and feel that you should have  received a notification letter and that you  want to review the project plans, call the  SHHA office.  2.   Once all comments are received, the ACC  will provide feedback to the project  applicant and work with the applicant to  address the comments that both the ACC  and the applicant feel could enhance the  project from a neighborhood point of view.  3.   If the ACC feels that the comments  expressed during the review process indicate  that there is a general feeling of uneasiness  within the neighborhood concerning the  project, the ACC may schedule a  neighborhood review meeting to allow  neighbors to meet with the ACC.  4.   Once the ACC has received all comments  from the neighborhood review and from any  subsequent neighborhood meetings and  discussions with concerned neighbors, the  ACC will consider all of these comments  before making a final decision.  Along with  general conditions stated in all ACC  approval letters, specific conditions  stemming from relevant neighborhood  comments will be incorporated, as  appropriate, in the approval letter.    The neighborhood review process is the product  of many years of experience in dealing with the  community’s need to continually build, update,  and modify its residences.  The ACC was  established by the covenants at their inception to  provide overall guidance to the property owners  and to maintain reasonable control of the  various architectural standards imposed by these  covenants.                             Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – September 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 9                                                                                                     Continued from page 7    In the beginning, there was no such “animal” as  the neighborhood review and it quickly became  obvious that this sort of review process was  important in order to consider the impact of a  construction project from the neighborhood’s  point of view.  The ACC continues to strongly  endorse the value of the neighborhood review as  a key ingredient in its evaluation process and I  encourage all recipients of a neighborhood  review notification to take a few moments to  review the material available to you for your  review and to submit comments as appropriate.   Don’t miss this opportunity and then regret that  you did not take the time to voice your concerns  once the project is underway!      z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log Summary of Approved  Projects activity since the last GRIT:     8 Juniper Hill Road – Resurface Driveway  22 Sandia Heights – Landscaping & Patio Enclosure  52 Cedar Hill Road – Garage Addition  218 Spring Creek Lane – Photovoltaic Panels  330 Paintbrush – Landscaping  554 Black Bear Place – Landscaping  635 Cougar Loop – Reroof  938 Bobcat Blvd.– Window Replacement  969 Antelope Ave – Storage Facility  1040 Red Oaks Loop – Wall   1123 Marigold Drive – Resurface Driveway  1169 Laurel Loop – Garage Door Replacement  1183 Laurel Loop – Water Harvesting System  1837 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence Replacement  2103 Navajo Willow - Landscaping  2812 Tramway Terrace Circle – Addition  7704 Cedar Canyon Road – Portable Basketball  System  7738 Cedar Canyon Road - Gazebo  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to read  about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Letter to the Editor from a Sandia  Heights Resident and SHHA  Member :  Our Sheriff’s Office in Action!     On Tuesday, I lost my cell phone. We looked  everywhere.  We called the number many times  and listened for the ring.  No luck. The next  morning, I was reminded that I had a “Find My  iPhone” application for my iPhone/iPad  combination. Sure enough! I could see my phone,  superimposed on a satellite map, moving around  the streets of Albuquerque. By early afternoon, it  stopped moving at a house near Wyoming and I- 40.      My husband drove to that house and got the house  number and the license tag number from the  vehicle in the driveway.  My husband stayed in  the vicinity. I called the Sheriff’s office and they  responded by sending two deputies to the location.  They knocked on the door and rang the door bell  many times with no response. Finally, someone  came to the door. They denied having any cell  phones in the house. They did, however, let the  deputies enter the house and look around. At their,  request, I called my cell phone 10 more times as  the deputies roamed the house. On the 11th call,  the deputy answered.  He had found the phone in  the daughter’s room, set to the “vibrate” mode.      The 11 yr old daughter had found the phone in a  parking lot where I had been the day before. She  may not have told her parents. The officers felt  that the parents did not know that she had it. No  charges were filed, but I understand that the  daughter learned a lesson.      As the deputies left the house, I could see, on my  iPad, the phone leaving the house and moving to  the street where my husband was parked. After a  brief pause, the cell phone began moving again,  this time in my husband’s possession. Wonders  will never cease. The cell phone was recovered,  thanks to modern technology and the diligence of  our Sheriff’s Department.    ‘Advent ol present an edosament by SHA  EN os. suDcoy  Doing What's Right for You  Sharon and Judson McCallum promote Top VALUES and SA Sandia Height They ofr feendy and profesional erie ‘Sharon McCollum | They know the Sandi Height Mey aswell ax anyone and cam make | Judson McCollum ny You net mwa complete cco ‘etn Ber ‘sion alr Pee Sharon snl usan are by pour side, working Itrd vos (505) 269.6217 "male sure yous gosh are arbor and (505) 269.3717  raster your bet interests are protected a all mes rarely ote  Visic us at wewsharonandjadson.com * wwwcsandiahcightcom + wowalbaquerquchomes.net  [2005-2012 MAAKET ACTIVITY « SANDLA HEIGHTS [205-2012 MARKET ACTIVITY» SANDU HEIGHTS DETACHED HOMES ON LOTS GREATER THAN ACRES Detacteb HOMES OW 01S Liss THN 30 ACRES  aa et S  ‘9 The GRIT - September 2012 - Volume 28 No. 9 23 YEAR RESIDENT  MAX SANCHEZ  LIVES, KNOWS & LOVES SANDIA HEIGHTS  In ALL Market Conditions, Max Consistently Sells More Homes in Sandia Heights than ANY other Realtor  33 Years of Experience  #1 Individual Coldwell Banker Agent in New Mexico  Interior and Exterior Painting Providing Great Work, by Great People for 25 years!

Now  that early  autumn is here,  we can continue  to expect to see  bears in our  area.      Their natural food sources at this time of year  are acorns, prickly pear fruit, and piñon nuts,  and that’s what grows at the elevation of our  Sandia Heights neighborhood.  So bears will  naturally come down to this altitude in  August, September, and October looking for  these natural food sources before they go into  hibernation, and we should not be alarmed to  see them.  They will still always be looking  for water.  Our role as wildlife stewards and  good neighbors is to enjoy any glimpses we  get of these magnificent animals, and to leave  them alone.  The New Mexico Department of  Game and Fish guidelines are to notify them  only if there’s a life-threatening situation.   This is a change in NMG&F policy of recent  years.  They no longer require you to report  sightings of bears or bears getting into  garbage or bird feeders. Garbage and bird  feeders are our responsibility.  Keep a lookout  and hope you’re lucky enough to see a bear  being a bear, and keep the “junk food” locked  away!
