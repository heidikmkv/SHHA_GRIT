The  Holidays can be difficult for many New  Mexicans with more than 20% of the population  living in poverty. Food drives enable the food  bank to provide a wide variety of high quality,  nutritious food items throughout the year. The  Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico  distributes more than 22 million pounds of food  a year to hundreds of nonprofit agencies  throughout New Mexico. Each one of us can  make an impact.     Beginning Thursday, November 1, please help  by bringing non-perishable food items to the  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association office  located at San Rafael and Tramway. Office  hours are Monday through Friday 9am-4pm.  Look for the big red drop box inside.     Most Needed Items:  Macaroni & Cheese, Canned Fruits, Canned  Vegetables, Canned Meats, Canned Entrees,  Cereal Bars, Rice, Sugar, Pastas, Soups, Baby  Food, Boxed Meals. Plastic, boxed, bagged and  canned containers present less chance of  breakage and less loss of good food.     MANY THANKS IN  ADVANCE   FOR YOUR  GENEROSITY!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    Guy Killam’s Thanksgiving    A Thanksgiving I remember most fondly was  when Guy Killam, my papa, brought home four  special friends from the pool hall. These four  elder men, all in their late 70’s and 80’s, and  Papa—also an elder gent-frequently played a  game called snooker at the local  “Establishment” (Papa’s word.) You know the  one: “Trouble in River City, and it’s spelled P- O-O-L”. Papa’s four guests were alone,  widowed, without family or certainly none in  sight. So, we were their family for this  Thanksgiving. As they one-by-one paraded into  our home, each greeted my mother and me in  great courtly manner, one brought flowers,  another, a box of chocolates. Each was dressed  in his finest-mostly rather seedy, outdated, not  altogether clean clothes, I noted-hair slicked,  faces shaven and tidied, shoes shined, neckties  representing a span of decades. The  commingling of aftershave with the fragrance of  tobacco embedded in their clothes created a  pungent sweetness from which I almost  swooned.    As we sat at table, sharing the Thanksgiving  repast Mother had prepared, we enjoyed World  War I stories, childhood memories, and great  conversation, all around ooohing, aaahing,  smacking of lips – the sounds of savoring  abounded throughout the feast.

Continued from Front Page    Papa was so proud and in love with Mother for opening heart  and home to these dear old fellows, gentlemen all. After dinner,  we gathered around the piano and sang “Faith of Our Fathers”  twice through, per our guests’ request (all the verses) after  which pumpkin pie and coffee were served to accompanying,  appreciative expressions.    As we all sat sated and satisfied, the magic of the moment  settled over us. When Papa’s friends, now our friends, left,  there were embraces and wonderful words giving thanks. The  house felt warmer and even more loved-in than before, and we  were all truly thankful. Later that night after we each tucked in  to bed, I heard the soft utterance of Papa’s every night’s prayer,  “Dear God, bless all humankind everywhere. Amen.”    Submitted by Virginia Fultz, Sandia Heights resident and  SHHA member (Unedited)      z  zz  zz  zz  zz  z    GRIT Publication: You are receiving this GRIT because  you are a Sandia Heights Homeowners Association member.

All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true! Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience  some of the great “perks” of living in Sandia  Heights!    z  zz  zz  zz  z    On-line GRIT Newsletter    The GRIT newsletter has been posted on the  SHHA website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   for over a year.

All disturbed areas shall be restored,  landscaped, or both, as applicable, no later than  the end of the next growing season following  the completion of construction.”    Activity associated with restoration of disturbed  landscaping area is usually done at the end of  most construction projects and may even occur  after the construction is completed depending on  when the “end of the next growing season”  occurs. In the ACC Design Guideline for  Landscaping, which was revised in September,  the growing season is defined as April through  October.  Thus, a project completed in June  must have the restoration efforts completed by  October of that same year whereas a project  completed in December has until October of the  next year to complete the restoration work.  The  ACC depends on the homeowner to follow the  intent of the general conditions in the approval  letter regarding landscape restoration, but we  have noticed several recent cases in which this  condition has been pretty much ignored by a  few homeowners.  In some cases, a homeowner  will submit a landscaping plan along with the  final construction plans, which helps the ACC  understand exactly what landscaping efforts are  contemplated following completion of the  construction.  This is what we would like to see  with all construction efforts, including the  replacement of septic tanks and their associated  leach fields, and, in fact, is now what the ACC  is going to require if the disturbed areas caused  by the construction nominally exceed 400  square feet.  Of course, the ACC will welcome  any efforts by homeowners to restore the  landscaping following construction regardless of  how small the affected area is.    If a homeowner needs to replace an existing  septic system, ACC approval is not required  since the County issues the permits for these  systems.  Replacement of the tank and the  associated leach field usually results in the  disturbance of large areas of the existing  property.  The ACC, however, does require the  homeowner to submit plans for restoration of  the affected area and will work with the  homeowner to ensure that the restoration meets  ACC landscaping guidelines.  Remember that it  is important not to place deep-rooted plants on  top of a leach field since roots can clog the  perforated pipes of the leach field and reduce  the effectiveness of the leaching process.    The ACC Charter specifies that the ACC shall  act at all times to ensure that the natural  landscape, and homeowners’ visual access to it,  is minimally impacted by property development,  and that the resulting construction is in harmony  with its natural surroundings and residences in  the immediate area.  With this in mind, and with  the apparent need to “tighten up a bit” on  landscape restoration, the ACC will be  monitoring adherence to the conditions spelled  out in the construction approval letters regarding  this subject.  We all need to strive to  maintain our beautiful natural landscape  here in this lovely community, and the  ACC will do its best to ensure that our  landscaping is not unduly degraded as  a result of a failure to restore affected  areas that are impacted by  construction activities.  8   The GRIT – November 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 11                                                                                                     z  zz  zz  zz  z      MAIL THEFT    Sandia Heights Security says that mail theft is  still a problem! Residents are advised not to  leave mail in mailboxes, either incoming or  outgoing. If you cannot retrieve your mail  promptly ask a trusted neighbor to get it for you.  If you are leaving town suspend your mail  delivery, have it held at the Post Office.  If you have mail that would be considered  sensitive or contains a check, you may want to  mail it at a USPS office.   Another suggestion might be to replace your  mailbox with either a heavy duty locking type or  totally enclosing the box  with acceptable construction and a lock to  impede vandals as well as thieves.  The MO of the perpetrators has been to drive  around neighborhoods in the early mornings,  when folks are out walking. Please be alert to  anyone in a vehicle checking mailboxes. A  license number on a vehicle along with a vehicle  description would go a long way to putting an  end to this activity.      If you experience mail theft, notify the BCSO  (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876- 2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856-6347  and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in  progress notify BCSO and Security.   z  zz  zz  zz  z      Letter to the editor: Sandia Heights  Neighbor Request     Please do not remove the real estate signs placed  to direct buyers to my Sandia Heights home that  I am selling.

To the person who is  removing my signs, you are negatively affecting  the value of all of our homes and should be  reminded that this act of vandalism is a felony  and prosecution will be sought against you to  the fullest extent of the law.       z  zz  zz  zz  z    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:     15 Juniper Hill Road – Pedestrian Bench  48 Rockridge Drive – Replace Door & Ramp  83 Juniper Hill Place – Reroof  150 Whitetail Road – Landscaping  185 Big Horn Ridge Circle - Restucco  207 Live Oak Road – Landscaping  419 Live Oak Court – Paint Trim  441 Live Oak Loop – Heating/Cooling Equipment  Replacement  639 Cougar Loop - Reroof  910 Tramway Lane – After-the-fact Solar Collector  968 Antelope Ave - Restucco  1038 Tramway Lane – Resurface walkways  1114 San Rafael - Restucco  1244 Rockrose Road - Landscaping  1861 Tramway Terrace Loop – Wall Replacement   1868 Tramway Terrace Loop – Landscaping  2033 Quail Run Drive – Repaint House  2037 Quail Run Drive – Paint Stucco & Trim  2756 Cliffrose Drive – Patio, Window Replacement  and Reroof  2869 Tramway Circle – Restucco  2873 Brushwood - Restucco  2896 Tramway Place – Reroof & Restucco  7707 Cedar Canyon Place – Window Replacement  8238 Raintree – Replace Swamp Cooler  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to read  about all projects currently under ACC  management.    z  zz  zz  zz  z      5504 Menaul  Riooday~Suseay 3.0  WaterWIsE LANDSCAPES  INCORPORATED)  ‘www.waterwiselandscapesnm.com DESIGN A NSTALLATON A NANTENANCE ~-505-344-7508 «505-350-2839  Preferred Plumbing, Heating © Cooling  UC No 25067  ‘Vet our besuted showroom 5504 Menaul NE Monday-Saturday to  ome er Ung ee #1738  ‘Agvertsements donot represent an endorsement by HHA,  00M RE-DO- mioar tee Bp your old  LIMITED TIME OFFER VE 2!  5504 Menaul NE  YOUR HOME SOLD,  GUARANTEED!  ¥  CallPete For Your Fee Sales ‘nd Marketing Consultation  Your home  ‘oF we will pay you! $3000.00  9 The GRIT - November 2012 - Volume 28 -No. 11  Moving.
