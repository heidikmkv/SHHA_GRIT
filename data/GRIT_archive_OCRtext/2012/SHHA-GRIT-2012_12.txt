Claire McCarthy and the Sandia Ranger District of the U.S. Forest Service    As the fall and winter holidays approach and more New Mexicans plan vacations or hunting trips  close to home, Federal and State fire agencies are urging caution about fire danger across many parts  of the state.    Lack of moisture and warm mild conditions this fall have caused fine, grassy fuels and brush to dry,  making them susceptible to wildfire. Here are some suggestions for landowners to help prevent  wildfires:   Thin trees and brush near structures.   Remove weeds and mow dry grasses.   Clear twig and leaf litter from roofs and gutters.   Stack firewood well away from structures.   Surround structures with drought- and fire-resistant or irrigated landscape.    Have a plan for evacuation.    You may find more information about Fall Fire Danger on the SHHA website:  sandiahomeowners.org under the Notices and Information Tab/Notices and Alerts.  Moving.

The Board of County  Commissioners passed resolutions imposing fire  restrictions on open burning and fireworks  outside the city limits of Albuquerque, in the  unincorporated areas of Bernalillo County. The  following are some of the fire restrictions:  Agricultural burning, bonfires, burning of  explosives, campfires, ceremonial fires, cooking  fires, hot torch burning, ignition of rocket  motors, open burning, open flames, burning  slash piles and burning weeds.     To obtain the full list please visit  the County website:  www.bernco.gov/Open_Burn_Ba n_Information/    While the County has a restrictive ordinance on  open burning for certain materials, covenants in  Sandia Heights prohibit burning. They  generally state: “No trash shall be burned on the  premises except in approved incinerators  located indoors or within service yard. No  garbage shall be burned. Garbage shall be  placed in covered containers, said containers to  be concealed from public view by an attractive  enclosure. No barbecue or other outdoor  cooking facility shall be located thereon nearer  than ten feet from either side of lot line unless  made a part of the residence.”     To check your covenants you may look them up  online at www.sandiahomeowners.org        DON’T LET YOUR WATER PIPES  FREEZE!    By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC    It’s too early yet to tell if Albuquerque’s  upcoming winter of  2012-2013 will be  unusually cold or not but I think it’s always a  good time right now to remind you how to  protect your water pipes from the effects of very  cold weather.  Most of the “local experts” on  this subject generally agree that steps need to be  taken to protect water pipes if temperatures are  expected to drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit.   A broken water pipe inside your home can cause  a lot of extensive and expensive damage!                                               Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – December 2012 – Volume 28 – No. 12                                                                                                     Continued from page 7    Let’s start with the outside of your home.   Disconnecting water hoses and protecting   outdoor water faucets are very important.  Water  that freezes in outdoor hoses connected to  faucets causes a buildup of pressure on interior  plumbing that can result in a rupture of the  interior pipes if the pressure is too high.   Damage to these interior pipes near an outdoor  water faucet is often difficult to repair due to the  inaccessibility of these pipes.  Disconnecting  hoses from these outdoor faucets and protecting  the faucets with hard foam insulating cups are  good ways to reduce the chances of damage to  these water pipes that extend through your  exterior walls.  These inexpensive foam cups  can be purchased at most home improvement or  hardware stores and are easy to install.  I’ve also  found that it is wise to wrap the outdoor faucet  with some insulation prior to placing the foam  cup over the faucet, particularly if the faucet is  located on the north side of your home or is  located in an area that does not receive any  winter sunshine.  Also, if you have any water  pipes that are located outside your home that are  exposed to the outside temperatures, you should  consider using insulating tape or heat tape  around these exposed pipes.    Now, let’s consider the inside of your home.  If  Albuquerque experiences a spell of extremely  cold weather where temperatures, particularly at  night, drop to below the 21 degrees Fahrenheit  “benchmark”, leave the water supply line on at a  very slow drip rate somewhere inside your  home.  Water in “slow motion” is much less  likely to freeze than water that is motionless  inside of a pipe.  Normally, a faucet located far  away from where the water enters your home is  the one that you should use for this purpose.   The cost of water used is insignificant compared  to the cost of repairing damage caused by a  broken water line inside your home.  Normally,  these very cold spells don’t last too long so  leaving an indoor faucet dripping for a few days  and nights should get you through these spells  until warmer temperatures return.  If you are  away from your home during the cold season,  make sure that there is adequate heat inside your  home to prevent pipes from freezing.  Even  when trying to save energy costs, don’t turn the  heat too far down and don’t turn the heat off  altogether unless you have all of the water lines  properly drained.  Believe me, I have seen the  damage caused by pipes that have not been  properly drained and have subsequently burst  inside the home where the heat has been turned  off!      One final note for those of you who have  swamp coolers.  If you have not already done  so, be sure to drain the water reservoir and  disconnect and drain the water supply line. It  doesn’t take much of a freeze to damage these  cooler components.  Have a great winter!!     ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last  GRIT:     35 Juniper Hill Loop – Repaint Trim  206 Spring Creek – Landscaping  617 Cedar Hill Road – Restucco  639 Cougar Loop – Window Replacement  727-1 Cedar Hill Lane – Fence Height Extension  727-3 Cedar Hill Lane – Restucco  821 C Live Oak Road - Restucco  830 D Live Oak Road – Reroof  868 Tramway Lane – Fence & Window Repair  1105 San Rafael – Landscaping  1833 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence Replacement  2414 Tramway Terrace Court - Signage  2505 Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof  2739 Tramway Circle – Fence Repair  Go to the website: sandiahomeowners.org. to read  about all projects currently under ACC  management.     23 YEAR RESIDENT  MAX SANCHEZ  LIVES, KNOWS & LOVES SANDIA HEIGHTS  In ALL Market Conditions, Max Consistently Sells More Homes in Sandia Heights than ANY other Realtor  33 Years of Experience  #1 Individual Coldwell Banker Agent in New Mexico  Interior and Exterior Painting Providing Great Work, by Great People for 25 years!

I officially retired October 26th, the day after  my 51st birthday. I was planning on telling  everyone goodbye in person but I had a heart  attack which resulted in a quadruple bypass  which kept me out of work in October. I am  recovering very quickly. Over the past 18  years I have enjoyed servicing Sandia  Heights. I've been happy working at UPS and  delivering gifts and orders to you, my  customers and friends. I look forward to this  next chapter in my life!  Time to spend with  my family and start a pet-sitting business after  I recover. You may contact me at  timabq@msn.com or 9208 Thornton Ave NE  87109.  It has been my pleasure being your  driver.  Thank you for making my job at UPS  memorable.
