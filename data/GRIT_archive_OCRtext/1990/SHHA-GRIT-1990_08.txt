THE  ==  ~= - ;;  Volume90  August 1990  Number3  SHHA Addresses Forest Access Issues  -- fa  "Sandia Heights is a community of  residents who are especially tuned-in to  family exercise and fitness and also to  wildlife and natural vegetation," says  Lenora Austin, '90-'91 SHHA Vice  President and Director of Parks and  Recreation. "This is what makes our  hiking and biking trails and access to the  national forest such an nnportant part of  the day-to-day life in our community."  Lenora reports that the focus of recent  meetings with representatives of the U.S.  Forest Service, the Sandia Peak Tram  Co., and Sandia Heights residents has  been the development of a viable, cohe- sive plan that will allow maximum use and  enjoyment of the trail system and forest  while protecting the natural vegetation  and wildlife, as well as the rights of indi- vidual property owners.  "Many residents and also the general  public have become accustomed to using  ..... •  certain access points and trails into the  national forest," Lenora says. "Not only  do some of these trails cross private  property which causes problems for the  affected property owners, but due to the  large number of trails in use, both wildlife  and vegetation are being disturbed and  destroy~d."  No new trails or forest access points are  being established or designated within  the Sandia Heights community, Lenora  reports. The purpose of this concerted  effort is to clarify the official and legal  forest access points, trails, and easements  that already exist. This will allow such  concerns as parking, trespassing, and  protection of the wildlife and vegetation  to be handled more efficiently in the  future. To help avoid confusion, forest  access points, parking areas, and ease- ments are marked on the new map that  will appear in the center of the 1990-91  Presic;l_eo~ Appoints Director of New Development  ~: .. ~:·~·;:·.:~·  .  "New coninitt.clal and residential de- velopment in our area is a fact of life,"  says Bob Williams, newly elected SHHA  Board Member. "And given the large  amount of both undeveloped commer- cial and residential tracts around and  within the Sandia Heights community,  this will be part of our lives for some time  to come."  Bob has been appointed by SHHA  President Bill Stabler as Director of New  Development where he will be respon- sible for keeping abreast of develop- ments -- both residential and commercial  -- that may impact the Sandia Heights  community.  "We originally thought that staying  1 abreast of new development would be  /  part of the activities of the SHHA Gov- ernment Liaison Committee," Bill said.  "However, the Tramway Improvement  Project and all of its ramifications is  keeping this Committee very busy. Bob is  an active member of the Government  Liaison Committee, however, and will  work closely with Chair Rod Stewart and  other members to coordinate their activi- ties and responsibilities. Bob's also our  first SHHA Board member to reside on  the west side ofTramway Blvd. Since the  majority of undeveloped land is located  in this vicinity, Bob and his fellow Sandia  Heights residents on the west side of  Tramway have an even higher degree of  interest in these projects."  "The purpose of the New Develop- ment Committee is not to take an adver- sarial role or oppose all development in  the area," Bob says. "That would be both  Continued on page 2  Sandia Heights Residents Directory,  which will be mailed to all SHHA mem- bers in the next few weeks.  In addition to working with the Asso- ciation to determine existing trails and  access points, the forest service has devel- oped several alternative plans for the  upgrading of foothills trails from the  Tram parking lot to the new Embudito  parking lot.  "U.S. Forest Service representatives  are looking for input on the proposed  plans from the residents of Sandia  Heights,'' Lenora said (see Community  Bulletin Board for information on up- coming forest service meeting). "The  SHHA Board encourages you to review  the plans and take an active role in decid- ing how we can best utilize and protect  this wonderful natural resource that's  right at our community's doorstep."

Message From The President  -- Bill Stabler, '90-'91 SHHA President  Do you know what the Homeowners Association Board of Directors and its  Committees do? Do you know how your dues are spent? Should the Board and  its Committees push for legal action on covenant violations? Should Associa- tion dues be utilized to help fund litigation against covenant violations?  I ask these questions because only 1/2of1 percent of the 1000 plus members  of the Association attended the annual members' meeting and election of new  Board members in June. If the Board looks at this statistic in a positive way, then  we must presume that your interests are being well represented and your needs  are being adequately met, and the Board will continue to take actions we deem  necessary and sufficient to uphold the by-laws of the Association.  On the . other hand, if you think the Association is not meeting the  community's needs, then I urge you to take positive action.  A group of  neighbors or club members sitting around discussing the shortcomings of the  Association is not only non-productive but also counter-productive to improv- ing the effectiveness of the SHHA Board of Directors and the quality of life in  our community.  What will make a difference is your interest, positive participation, and  cooperation in the actions and activities of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association. The SHHA Board of Directors has a full agenda of concerns and  responsibilities and too few Association members who are willing to take an  active role in addressing those concerns. As the new SHHA President, I am  personally inviting you to attend the next Board of Directors meeting. If you  would like some time on the agenda to address a particular issue, just contact  me or the SHHA office prior to the meeting.  However, I would like to point out that the Homeowners Association can not  offer a cure-all for all of the problems affecting our community, and it can not  serve as a policing agent to enforce the covenants on your behalf. It is the  Association's responsibility to address issues that have .an impact on the overall  community. In addition, the Board and staff do their best to direct you to the  appropriate people and other sources for help and information. However, each  individual resident also must be willing to deal with the problems that impact  him/her personally. In other words, positive and productive action to improve  your street, subdivision, or the overall community should begin with you.  New Development Director  Continued from page 1  a waste of time and counterproductive to the growth and economic development of  the city, county, and state. Our goals are to stay informed regarding all proposed new  development in our area; evaluate the potential affects of each development on the  property values and overall quality of life in the Sandia Heights community; and act  as a focal point for information about each project."  Bob encourages all SHHA members with questions regarding the proposed  Primrose Pointe development in North Albuquerque Acres to give him a call at 292- 4949 and hopes residents will notify him if they see any posted signs about zoning  changes or requests for special use applications. Bob also is seeking Committee  members who would like to get involved in this area of the Association's activities.

From The Desk  Of Chief 5  I want to commend all of the residents  in the Sandia Heights community for your  assistance and cooperation during the  weed burning and fireworks season.  Even though its been extremely dry and  fire danger has been very high over the  past three months, the fire department  has responded to only 10 calls. During the  same period last year, we responded to  127 brush and fireworks-related fires.  This is proof positive that when the  community pulls together for a common  cause, we can be both effective and victo- rious.

Page8  Pre-Construction Planning Reduces Headaches and Delays  Don't wait until a few days prior to the  desired starting date for your construc- tion or renovation project to submit plans  to the SHHA Architectural Review  Committee for review and approval. This  kind of last minute effort not only creates  headaches for the Committee, but it also  can cause aggravating and costly delays  for you and/or your contractor.  In accordance with the Declaration of  Restrictions (covenants) for all Sandia  Heights subdivisions, the Committee has  30 days from the date of submission to  either approve or disapprove the plans.  The plan approval process involves the  following steps: Initial plan review to  verify that all required information has  been provided; assignment of a Commit- tee member to follow the project from  review through completion of construc- tion; nearby property owners are notified  and invited to see the plans; plan review  to verify compliance with the covenants;  site inspection by Committee member/ s;  Committee consensus is reached regard- ing approval or disapproval; approval  letter and other necessary paperwork are  prepared; plans and appropriate corre- spondence are returned to homeowner/  contractor.  No construction project is permitted to  commence without first receiving ap- proval from the Architectural Review  Committee. Contractors/residents who  start construction before receiving ap- proval are automatically in violation of  the covenants and subject to appropriate  legal action.  With the exception of inviting adjacent  property owners to see the plans which is  done only in the case of a variance re- quest, new home construction, or home  addition, the steps in the approval proc- ess remain the same. While the Commit- tee makes every effort to expedite this  process, residents and contractors alike  should recognize and appreciate that the  Committee is comprised of volunteer- members of the SHHA Board of Direc- tors who perform this service for the  Homeowners Association in their "free"  time and in addition to their regular full- time jobs.  WANTED  Information and forms for submitting  plans for review and approval are avail- able from the SHHA office, 275-9112.  New Home Construction  Plans recently were submitted and  approved for new home construction at  the following addresses. Construction at  these locations has already started or will  begin in the near future:  201 Spring Creek (Unit 2-North)  Richard Schalk, Architect/  Project Manager  883-1808  1053 Red Oaks Loop (Unit 10-South)  Parkwest Construction, Inc.  292-9758  Plans have been submitted and cur- rently are under review for new home  construction at the following address:  1205 Marigold (Unit 12-South)  Eric Spurlock, Architect  298-6326  Sandia Heights artists, craftsmen, stitchers, bakers, and candlestick makers  to sell their hand-crafted specialties to willing buyers.

My  Sandia Heights home had a kitchen  so  dark  we  could have  held  a  seance  there.  In  spite  of  a  skylight,  the  counter  top,  cabinets, walls and floors seemed  drab rather than cozy, and closed- in rather than spacious. At clean- up time my son complained of eye- strain. It was time to remodel.  Now although I  have no plans  for moving, I decided to take the  advice I give to friends and the  clients  I  work  with  at  Cameo  Realty.  "Remodel with an eye to  improving the value of your home,  without  losing  money  on  your  improvements  when  you  sell."  A  wonderful  side  benefit  of this  advice, is that you save money at  the same time. It's quite easy to  lose from $10,000 to $30,000 on  the striking, but poorly thought- out changes you've made in your  dream kitchen.  Here are some general rules of  thumb,  (even if yours is allergic  to hammers and you plan to have an  expert to do it) .  1. _Evaluate ·what you must keep.  I.n  my  case, · I  decided the dark  wooden ca.binets were really quite  nice, so I kept them but changed  their setting.  2. New counter tops and cabinet  knobs.added pizzazz for pennies.  3. Even more obvious is a new  coat of paint to the walls. In my  case, I used an off-white paint to  lighten the kitchen dramatically,  but added a border of wallpaper  for a touch of color.  4. To do away with the clutter  and provide convenience,  have  a  carpenter  match  your  cabinets'  wood  and  build  an  "appliance  garage." Maximize the space inside  the  garage  by  adding  a  "lazy  Susan. 11  5.  Take  a hard look at your  floors, especially in the entryway  and kitchen,  which often receive  the most traffic. Why not change  the floor covering now, so you can  enjoy it, rather than waiting and  buying new tiles or carpets for  the next owner?  Since  many  homes  in  Sandia  Heights were built between ten and  twenty  years  ago,  it  actually  makes more sense to remodel here,  because the homes have retained  their value. Before you call in a  carpenter  or  interior designer,  however, I' 11 be happy to provide  pizzazz to your home, but give you  the most return for the money.  Some  home  owners  like  my  husband,  Neil,  and I,  work for  local companies. But many others  are subject to corporate moves to  other  parts  of  the  country.  Because Cameo Realty is affiliated  with several national companies,  we're able to provide help and  information about moving anywhere  in  the  U.S.  and  many  foreign  countries.  I'm also  trained in  ways  to help people  make their  homes saleable, and then to help  them with information about their  new  community,  its  resources,  schools,  medical  facilities,  neighborhoods,  and  houses.  I'll  also share information about home  prices,  mortgages,  closing costs  Page 9  and local  laws that often vary  from state to state.  I've discovered one thing.  I  don't always follow my own advice.  I  know the kinds of landscaping  that  adds  that  special  "curb  appeal" that goes a long way to  selling  a  house.  But  I  still  planted  lots  of  flowers.  Why?  Because I love flowers - and also  because  I  learned  about  wild  flowers when I  joined the Sandia  Heights Wildflower Club.  If I can help you, call me at  home 296-1091 or at Cameo Realty  292-2021.  CAM CO ..  _  --REALTY  NO ONE WANTS TO MOVE FROM  SANDIA HEIGHTS  'B'll'T I!F 70'll Af'llS'I. ...  ..• !liE/R ...

That idea came to fruition in the form  of Southwest Sampler magazine, Mary- Jo's solution to how to sell the crafts of  local artisans.  She took her idea to  Sampler Publications Inc. of St. Charles,  Ill. who was already publishing Country  Sampler and Victorian Sampler.  "I was fortunate to be able to turn my  love for everything Southwestern into a  profitable enterprise," Mary-Jo says.  The first issue of Southwest Sampler  premiered in January, 1990, and its  immediate popularity even surprised the  publisher and Chicago staff. The maga- zine is distributed nationally through B.  Dalton, Waldenbooks, and independent  shops.  Southwest Sampler is a quarterly peri- odical that offers handmade craft items  from throughout the Southwest along  with articles on homes, decorating, cui- sine, art, and lifestyles of the Southwest.  Of the 99 advertisers in the first issue, one  third of them were New Mexicans and  seven were New Mexico craft coopera- tives.  Focus of the Spring, 1991 issue of the  magazine will be a look inside the beau- tiful homes of Albuquerque.  "We are just in the planning stages  right now," Mary-Jo says, "and that's why  I'm asking Sandia Heights' residents for  their help. We are looking for South- west-style homes,  particularly with  Southwestern furnishings and art. If your  home fits this description, then we might  be interested in photographing it for our  Spring issue."  The publisher asks that you send snap- shots of both the interior and exterior to  Kristen Browning-Blas, Editor, South- west Sampler, 707 Kautz Road, St.  Charles, IL 60174.  Even though Mary-Jo, a former music  agent, and her husband, Dan,just moved  into Sandia Heights in June, they are both  long-time residents of Albuquerque.  "Dan and I have been crazy about our  home in Sandia Heights for years. Actu- ally, we wanted to move up here ever  since our friends, Dugan and Sandy El- kins who were the former o\vners, first  invited us over. When they put the house  up for sale, we couldn't pass up the oppor- tunity to move into our dream house in  our favorite neighborhood."  Beep! Beep!  Some of our neighbors are really a  kick! Top of the list is that rackety friend,  the roadrunner who makes noises like a  rusty gate or, at other times, sounds as if  the cat has been stepped on (I understand  he thinks he's crooning a fove song when  he does that). He not only makes insult- ing noises but is absolutely without any  sensibility about anyone's (or dog's) pri- vacy and considers that all houses and  yards are part of his personal estate.  He behaves as ifhe thinks he is God's  most enchanting creature, in spite of the  fact that he moves very much like the  animated cartoon that was based on him  ... like a wheeled toy that has not been  oiled for years. He does have that bright  red spot behind his eye and a blue one in  front of it, a handsome crest that he can  raise or lower when he chooses, a few  blue-black or greenish feathers and a bit  of bright blue on his scales which he may  think is dashing but perhaps is a bit de- classe' compared to some other birds.  He is one of the few creatures that the  dog will trouble to run off the lawn, but he  only moves some comfortable distance to  calmly watch the idiot dog make a fuss.  He appears completely fearless.  His  favoiite perch is on top of the chimney  where he can denounce the activities of  the rest of the world. We are I ucky that we  still have open land around where he can  continue to chase the insects and lizards  that he feeds on and close enough so we  can observe his activities. He approves of  the water we put out but those who have  pools should watch out for him. He can't  swim and has been known to drown in  shallowwater. He can fly a bit and can sail  Page 11  THEVIEVV FROM TACKRABBIT HILL  great distances if he gains a bit of height  but prefers to rummage around the  ground most of the time.  The West is full of wonderful tales  about this odd member of the cuckoo  family; about his ability to catch and  swallow snakes, even rattlers; about his  lack of fear of men and preference for  regular habits as well as his group hunting  activities. A friend tells me about a  doctor she knew who had a roadrunner  friend that waited regularly at 4:30 when  the doctor came home (he must have  been a dermatologist!!) to be fed a chunk  of hamburger, after which he went on his  way until the same time the next after- noon when he showed up for his treat.  One morning we watched through the  glasses what appeared to be three or four  roadrunners attacking something in the  grass, perhaps a snake. They were obvi- ously acting in concert. First one would  jump up, then pounce, and then another  would repeat the performance.  This  went on for several minutes. We never  found out what they were attacking, but  they were all in on the act. There are  stories of roadrunners using cactus pads  to attack rattlers and even building fences  of colla spines around them so that the  snakes exhausted themselves as they  tried to strike out of the cactus corral.  Quite unbelievable but affirmed many  times!  Anyone who would like a more de- tailed accolint of this cuckoo (in several  senses) bird should read Virginia  Douglas' little book, Road-Runner, put  out by Naturegraph. He's a neighbor to  be watched.·  --Jea11 Heflin  [Editor's Note: Jeall Hef/ill has co- authored a book with Emia Pilz on pe11ste- nzo11s of New Mexico, a native North  America11 wildflower.

BRUSHWOOD Homes  881-6819  has met with George Radnovich, land- scape architect with Bohannon Huston,  and Judith Phillips, noted author and  expert on low water and low maintenance  (xeriscape) landscaping. It's all a theo- retical design at this point, Judith reports,  since there currently are no funds avail- able to complete the working drawings or  installation. At the very least the commit - tee hopes to get a commitment from the  State Highway Department that reseed- ing of the disturbed areas along the road- way will be done at a time when the native  grasses will germinate ... not simply upon  completion of construction.  The Landscaping Committee also is  researching possible sources of grant  monies for the project and recently met  with representatives of the U.S. Soil  Conservation District who are interested  in the project for soil conservation/ero- sion prevention reasons and also as a  demonstration project for xeriscape  landscaping.  Everyone agrees, however, that the  number one priority is acquisition of the  funds to complete the road construction.  Commissioner Cassidy has hopes to get a  $4 million County Bond Issue on the  ballot for this fall; she already has ob- tained a commitment from the Highway  Commission to match those funds.  "As this County Commission may not  be all that eager to put anything on the  bond issue for the Northeast Heights, I  would urge you to contact each of them  and express your support," says Commis- sioner Cassidy.

The  answer is Sandia Heights Park.  Unfortunately this spot of green does  not come cheaply. During the last fiscal  year which concluded in June, the Asso~  ciation spent more than $10,000 on park  maintenance, water, and lease of the park  site. The expense of leasing the park site  is shared by the Sandia Heights Home- owners Association and the Sandia Peak  Tram Co. However park maintenance  and water, which comprise the major part  of the park's expenses, are the sole re- sponsibility of the Homeowners Associa- tion.  "At one point, there was some discus- sion about turning the park over to the  County to help ease the fmancial burden  on the Association," reports Lenora  Austin, Director of SHHA Parks and  Recreation. "However, since the park  site is leased from the Sandia Pueblo, this  is not an option."  "The SHHA Board of Directors views  the park as a real benefit to the entire  community," Lenora says. "And with  Sandia Heights' commitment to natural  vegetation and the shortage of County  parks in the area, it makes this spot of  green even more important to our resi- dents."  Only Association members canreserve  the park for private parties.  Lenora  reports that the Board will be considering  allowing nonmember residents to re- serve the park by paying a usage fee to  help defray some of the park's expenses.  This would allow the Association not only  to keep the landscaping and recreational  equipment in better condition but also to  add to the park's facilities. Currently,  there is a baseball backstop and ball field,  a children's play area with swings and a  seesaw, basketball goals, iirl:cl'a number of  picnic tables. The Association also has  purchased a basketball, soccer ball,  horseshoes, and baseball/softball equip- ment that can be checked out by Associa- tion members for their use at the park.  Due to the large number of residents  who bring their dogs to the park, the  SHHA Board is considering posting  "Keep Dogs Off The Grass" signs,  Lenora says. People walking their dogs  on the dirt areas at the park is acceptable.  But when dogs are allowed out on the ball  field or in the children's play area to do  what dogs do best, it makes it very un- pleasant for other residents who want to  enjoy this facility.  "Personally, I find it incredible that  these residents don't clean up after a pet  who creates a mess on the grass or the  children's play area," Lenora said.  "That's just part of being a responsible  pet owner."  Members' input and opinions regard- ing park usage and facilities are very  important to the SHHA Board of Direc- tors, and the Association certainly could  make good use of your time and talents if  you want to get involved in the SHHA  Parks and Recreation program.
