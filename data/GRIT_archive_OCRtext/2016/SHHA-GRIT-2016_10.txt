Parking is available at the rear of the building, where the  entrance to the event is located.  Sandia Heights Services will be present at the meeting as well.  All SHHA residents are welcome to attend and hear about current  activities as well as how the department plans to continue to increase  safety resources for Sandia Heights.    Meet and Greet Procedures of Conduct:  1. Please silence all cell phones during the meeting.  2. Each speaker is limited to three minutes.    FALL BEAR ALERT  We are now in the season when the bears are trying to pack on the  pounds so they can make it through the winter in hibernation. Bears  usually go into dens in November, so please continue to be vigilant. Keep  garbage in the garage and put it outside no earlier than the morning of  trash pickup. Don’t feed your pets outside. Bring bird feeders inside at  night. Bears can demolish empty bird feeders during the summer—they  know those things usually have birdseed in them, and they will go after  feeders even if they are empty. Keep ripe fruit picked and clean up fallen  fruit.    Above all, enjoy the privilege of living in this beautiful area and sometimes  getting a glimpse of our wild neighbors!      2017 SHHA Resident Directory Deadline    Please check your listing in the 2016 Resident Directory and let the office  know if you have any changes or additions. All changes must be received  before Friday November 4, 2016 in order for them to be included in the  2017 Resident Directory.          2   The GRIT – October 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 10                                                                                                        What do skeletons say before they begin  dining?

Each of us is  responsible for maintaining our part of the right  of way. Please be reminded about the dangers  of thick vegetation along driveways and  consider cutting thick vegetation away from the  entrance/exit of your driveways so that both  you and oncoming cars and pedestrians have  better visibility.  The County works closely with SHHA to cut   along all roadsides at a 45-degree angle in  order to help improve visibility. This has  helped a great deal, but it does not solve all  problems for pedestrians or drivers. We want to  encourage each of you to call the SHHA office  if you note specific areas where either the  chamisa is too overgrown or perhaps signs are  being blocked by trees and vegetation at  intersections. (The County prefers to have one  contact with SHHA for reporting such nuisance  areas.)  If you have a Siberian elm growing in the  County right of way of your property, please  call the County directly at 848-1503. They will  remove the tree and treat it with Garlon to  prevent regrowth. (In this case, the County  requires the homeowner to make the request  directly to them, rather than by way of the  SHHA, to be sure that the homeowner wants  the tree removed.)      Bernalillo County Road Work   By Joe Pappe, SHHA President     Does your road need some clean up after a big  rain? All County work order requests should be  made directly to the Bernalillo County Contact  Center at 848-1503 or email:  contactcenter2@bernco.gov.        Halloween Trick or Treat Reminder    Please use extra caution as you drive on  Halloween and turn off your entry/exterior lights  if you prefer not to have trick-or-treaters stop by  your home.

Leaving them in your driveway or yard is not  permitted by your covenants.  Please be considerate  to your neighbors and after you have unloaded your  rolling stock remove it from Sandia Heights.   [If you  wish to construct a house or garage for your toys  please consult with the Architectural Committee first  to discuss your plans before you start.]     Now is also a good time to spruce up your yard for  Fall and Winter.  The Summer has brought out a  growth of the natural vegetation and weeds.  Look  around your lot for dead trees and bushes and please  remove them.  If the tree does not have leaves by  now you can probably consider it dead.  Although  you may think it is neat for bird nesting or part of the  natural landscaping, your covenants generally require  you to remove dead trees and bushes and some units  require you to maintain your landscape.  Again, the  CSC asks that you be considerate of your neighbors  and take care of your lot.    DON’T LET YOUR WATER PIPES  FREEZE!  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC      Well, once again it’s time for my annual  article on how to prevent your water pipes from  freezing.   It’s too early yet to tell if Albuquerque’s  upcoming winter of  2016-2017 will be unusually  cold or not but I think it’s always a good time right   now to remind you how to protect your water pipes   from the effects of very cold weather.  Most of the  “local experts” on this subject generally agree that  steps need to be taken to protect water pipes if  temperatures are expected to drop below 21 degrees  Fahrenheit.  A broken water pipe inside your home  can cause a lot of extensive and expensive damage!   For you “old-time residents” there is nothing new in  this article so it is really for the benefit of our  newcomers who have joined our community during  the past year or so.    Let’s start with the outside of your home.   Disconnecting water hoses and protecting outdoor  water faucets are very important.  Water that freezes  in outdoor hoses connected to faucets causes a  buildup of pressure on interior plumbing that can  result in a rupture of the interior pipes if the pressure  is too high.  Damage to these interior pipes near an  outdoor water faucet is often difficult to repair due to  the inaccessibility of these pipes.  Disconnecting  hoses from these outdoor faucets and protecting the  faucets with hard foam insulating cups are good ways  to reduce the chances of damage to these water pipes  that extend through your exterior walls.  These  inexpensive foam cups can be purchased at most  home improvement or hardware stores and are easy  to install.  I’ve also found that it is wise to wrap the  outdoor faucet with some insulation prior to placing  the foam cup over the faucet, particularly if the faucet  is located on the north side of your home or is located  in an area that does not receive any winter sunshine.   Also, if you have any water pipes that are located  outside your home that are exposed to the outside  temperatures, you should consider using insulating  tape or heat tape around these exposed pipes.    Now, let’s consider the inside of your home.   If Albuquerque experiences a spell of extremely cold  weather where temperatures, particularly at night,  drop to below the 21 degrees Fahrenheit  “benchmark”, leave the water supply line on at a very  slow drip rate somewhere inside your home.  Water  in “slow motion” is much less likely to freeze than  water that is motionless inside of a pipe.  Normally, a  faucet located far away from where the water enters  your home is the one that you should use for this  purpose.  The cost of water used is insignificant  compared to the cost of repairing damage caused by a  broken water line inside your home.     Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – October 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 10    Continued from page 7  Normally, these very cold spells don’t last long so  leaving an indoor faucet dripping for a few days and  nights should get you through these spells until  warmer temperatures return.  If you are away from  your home during the cold season, make sure that  there is adequate heat inside your home to prevent  internal pipes from freezing.  Even when trying to  save energy costs, don’t turn the heat too far down  (experts recommend no lower than 55 degrees F)  and don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you  have all of the water lines properly drained.  Believe  me, I have seen the damage caused by pipes that  have not been properly drained and have  subsequently burst inside the home where the heat  has been turned off!    One final note for those of you who have  swamp coolers.  If you have not already done so, be  sure to drain the water reservoir and disconnect and  drain the water supply line. It doesn’t take much of a  freeze to damage these cooler components.  Have a  great winter!!

We have evaluations from Air  Conditioning to Windows and everything in between. These binders are available for SHHA  members to peruse. We collect these forms when an Architectural Control Committee  homeowner project has been completed. The evaluations are very useful in a similar way to  Angie’s list. We are in need of some updated information for pest control, house and pet sitters,  septic tanks and appliance repair companies. You may obtain a Contractor Evaluation form from  the office or online at:  https://sandiahomeowners.org/images/forms/acc_contractor_evaluation_form.pdf  Notice: Any corrections to anything found in the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website.  Community Event Bulletin Board  Not all of these groups are sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are in our eleventh year of the Sandia  Heights “Cork & Fork” dinner group. We meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our  members. Each small group is usually three couples plus a host couple, with each couple  contributing to some part of the dinner menu.  All couples and singles are welcome.  The  emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. We’re always happy to have new  folks join us, so if this sounds like an activity that you might be interested in, please contact  Linda Mason at lindamason307@gmail.com or 505-554-2934.
