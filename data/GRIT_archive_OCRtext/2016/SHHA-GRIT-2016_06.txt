SHHA wants your thoughts on GRIT Online vs. Printed    By Cindy Mottle, Communications and Publications Chair    The SHHA office invites you to drop by until Friday June 24, and register your  preference on how you would like to receive the GRIT. We will continue to  document your preferences after Labor Day.  The GRIT newsletter is posted on the SHHA website  http://sandiahomeowners.org/grit-newsletter . Viewing the online version is free.  The printed mailed GRIT costs a lot of trees! The approximate $14,000 printing  costs are offset by approximate $14,000 advertising income.     You can sign up to receive email alerts regarding any activity in the Sandia  Heights area that might affect you, such as a wildlife alert or a security issue.   You will also receive a notification, including the link, when the online version of  the GRIT is available for viewing. The aim is to have members consider receiving  the GRIT electronically instead of the printed version.     The advantages, besides saving trees and reducing mailing and printing costs,  are quite attractive: The electronic version is in color and has useful internet links  to passive and dynamic internet pages. For example, we can, in the future,  include video and graphic presentations of events of interest to Sandia Heights  residents. Also, the on-line version is higher resolution. If you do decide to sign up  for the online GRIT you will also receive email alerts. To sign up either email our  office at sandiaheights@comcast.net, or drop by to register your preference.      Mhoon/Hawks Landing Update:  At the May 3, 2016 public hearing, the Board of County Commission  approved the request for a Special Use Permit for a Planned Development  Area on property described as Tract 5, Lands of Mhoon, SP-79-69, located  on the east side of Tramway, between Live Oak Road and San Bernardino,  zoned A-1, containing approximately  10.40 acres. The decision was based  on certain Findings and is subject to particular Conditions.

Photo: University of Texas at El Paso    This creepy-looking critter is not a scorpion,  even though it tries to look like one. This  masquerade is what gets them squashed by  people who don’t know what they are. This is a  VINEGAROON (Mastigoproctus giganteus),  sometimes called a whiptail scorpion. It can  grow to three inches long or more, not including the  tail. Why is it called a whiptail scorpion? The answer  is obvious if you look at the long, thin whiplike tail.  Vinegaroons are related to spiders and have eight  legs, although the first pair of legs is modified as  antennae, and are not used for walking.  They are completely harmless to humans—the tail  does not have a stinger--although the curved  mouthparts can deliver a pinch. The name  “vinegaroon” comes from the creature’s habit, when  threatened, of spraying a mist from the base of its  tail that is primarily acetic acid, or vinegar. Legend  has it that if a vinegaroon bites you, everything will  taste like vinegar for weeks. Of course this is not  true, but if you get a spray of vinegar in your face  you probably won’t like it! Vinegaroons are  nocturnal, and they prey on insects and other  arthropods. So if you happen to see a vinegaroon,  be happy that it’s keeping the cricket and other  insect populations in balance. It’s another of our  wild neighbors that we can’t do without—even  though it isn’t exactly cute!      VOLUNTEERS NEEDED!

A SHHA member recently wrote us with a  detailed description of how annoying  neighborhood barking dogs can be,  particularly in the early morning and  evening.   Your Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  would like to help with the following  information:  1. This is a noise complaint and, as none  of the Sandia Heights covenants  address barking dogs, noise  disturbances need to be reported to  Bernalillo County, not SHHA’s CSC.  County code states:” It is unlawful for a  person to allow an animal to  persistently or continuously bark, howl  or make noise common to their species  or otherwise disturb the peace and  quiet of inhabitants of the county.”  2. Before you take that step, we  recommend you keep a log for at least  two weeks of when (date and time) and  how long the barking continues each  time you record it.  3. To file a Complaint, follow this link:  http://epermits.bernco.gov/CitizenAcces s/, scroll down to “Code Enforcement”,  and click on, “Submit a Complaint”.    You, the SHHA, Covenant  Enforcement, and Anonymous  Complaints         The Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) is charged with the responsibility of  ensuring that all owners of property in  Sandia Heights adhere to the provisions of  the covenants applicable to the particular  Unit where the property is located.  There  are about 40 different Units within the  Sandia Heights community, and no two sets  of covenants are exactly the same. This  diversity in our covenants makes  community-wide enforcement difficult at  best. In addition, the CSC does not patrol  throughout Sandia Heights looking for  covenant violations. As such, the CSC has  developed procedures that depend on  members of the SHHA to report covenant  violations.       Who can report a violation? First, you  must be a property owner in Sandia Heights  and be a member of SHHA in order to  submit a covenant violation form. The  covenant violation form (Report of  Suspected Covenant Violation) is available  at the SHHA office and from the SHHA  website. Although the CSC does not act on  anonymous complaints, your anonymity as  the complainant will be shielded unless  future court action requires that your  identity be revealed. Historically, court  actions of this nature are very rare.  Any  SHHA member may submit a covenant  violation form, however, the CSC normally  will act on submissions from residents in  the same Unit where the violation exists, in  an adjacent Unit, or in direct line of sight of  the violation regardless of the Unit you  reside in. The CSC will exercise its  discretion as to whether or not to act on  violations outside of the normal guidelines.

The water can be reused for your house plants or out in  the garden.    Avoid using running water to thaw food, instead defrost the food in the refrigerator.    Soak pots and pans instead of letting the water run while you clean them.    Don’t leave the water running when brushing your teeth or shaving. Get in the habit of  turning the water off when it’s not being used.    Washing dark clothes in cold water saves water, energy and helps clothes retain their  color.    Put food coloring in your toilet tank. If it seeps into the bowl without flushing, there’s a  leak. Fix it and start saving gallons.  When running water for a shower, collect the cold water in a bucket and use to water  plants. If running a bath, plug the bathtub before turning the water on and adjust the  temperature as it fills.  Water your grass and trees more heavily, but less often, it saves water and builds stronger  roots.  Water lawns during the early morning hours or evening when temperatures and wind speed  are the lowest.  This reduces water losses from evaporation.

Information listing you as  the complainant is on the form since the  CSC may want to contact you for additional  details related to your complaint. The  specific violation and its location need to be  identified, along with the rationale  supporting your belief that a violation has  occurred. It also helps to identify the specific  paragraph in the applicable Unit covenants  that you think is being violated. The  covenants for the location where the alleged  violation is occurring are on the website and  the office can also help you identify possible  applicable covenants. The form asks if you  have contacted the violator, but this contact  is not a requirement in order to submit the  form. The CSC is very sensitive about not  creating an adversarial relationship between  the complainant and the potential violator.  You may choose to talk to your neighbor to  try to resolve the violation first, but as stated  previously, the CSC does not require or  recommend this one-on-one contact. The  last item required is your signature on the  form.  The SHHA staff will recognize  electronic signatures that include the  member’s e-mail address. As stated before,  the CSC will not respond to complaints  submitted by phone calls, notes, or  anonymously.  How does the CSC handle the  complaint? A member of the CSC will be  assigned to investigate the complaint and to  try to resolve it. The member first assesses  the validity of the complaint by verifying the  information submitted on the violation form.  If the complaint is deemed invalid the  complainant will be notified by mail and the  file will be closed.  If it is clear that a valid  violation exists, the member will complete  an investigative report. The violator will  receive written notification from the CSC  regarding the specific violation and will be  given a reasonable deadline by which to  remedy it. The member will follow up with  the violator to ensure that the violation is  corrected in accordance with the stated  timeline. If the violation is successfully  resolved at this point, both parties will be  notified by mail and the file will be closed.   If, however, the violation is not resolved as  a result of the first letter, a second letter will  be sent to the violator with an additional  timeline for resolution and a warning that  failure to comply may result in legal action.  If the second letter is unsuccessful in  solving the violation, the file will be turned  over to the SHHA attorney for further action.  Why should you care about covenant  enforcement? Resident surveys conducted  over the years have consistently indicated  that the primary goal of SHHA should be the  enforcement of our covenants. The  covenants were designed to benefit all  property owners in Sandia Heights in order  to preserve and maintain the beauty, quality  of life, and property values in this unique  community. The SHHA and the CSC  actively seek your support for the  enforcement of our covenants. This is your  community and your covenants and  everyone appreciates your compliance.       8   The GRIT – June 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 6                                                                                                     TIPS FOR YOUR HOME  REMODELING PROJECTS    By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman      Before you begin an exterior or interior  remodeling project for your home, consider some  of these following issues:    1.  Depending on the size of the project,  consider hiring a general contractor (GC).  For  large projects such as adding a garage, another  room, or a re-do of an existing kitchen or  bathroom, a qualified GC can save you a lot of  coordination headaches.  The job of the GC is to  manage all of the various subcontractors (subs, for  short) needed for a remodeling job.  In essence,  the GC runs the show by coordinating the activities  of the various subs.  Without the oversight of the  GC, there will most likely be a lack of  communication among the various subs since  subs often do not talk with one another.  A good  GC will work to prevent these sorts of problems.    2.  Make sure you talk with the County and  get a building permit, if required.  Some small jobs  don’t need a permit but most major remodels do  need one.  In general, your contractor is  responsible for obtaining proper building permits— the ACC does not get involved in permits but can  ask you for proof of a permit.  If you don’t “build to  code”, you could end up with fees and fines if the  County inspectors determine that you should have  had a permit before starting your remodeling job.   The cost of subsequent fees and fines could  exceed the cost of the permit.  In addition,  remodeling done without a permit may cause  potential issues when you go to sell your home.    3.  As I have said in previous articles, be  sure that the contractors you select to handle your  home remodeling projects are properly licensed  and insured. Don’t be afraid to ask for  proof of  licensing and insurance.  The Better Business  Bureau (BBB) advises homeowners to get the  name of the insurance carrier and to confirm with  the carrier that the contractor has the coverage.   The BBB further advises reading reviews about  potential contractors online and then asking  contractors for references.  Take the time to speak  with references and ask if you can see the finished  product.    I continue to hope that these monthly GRIT  articles are useful to homeowners here in Sandia  Heights and if you have any suggestions for future  articles, please let me know.
