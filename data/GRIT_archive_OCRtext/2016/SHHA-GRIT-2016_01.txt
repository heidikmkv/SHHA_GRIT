Residents are advised  not leave mail in  mailboxes, either  incoming or outgoing. If you cannot retrieve  your mail promptly ask a trusted neighbor to  get it for you. If you are leaving town suspend  your mail delivery - have it held at the Post  Office.  If you have mail that would be considered  sensitive, you may want to mail it at a USPS  office. Another suggestion might be to replace  your mailbox with either a heavy duty locking  type or totally enclosing the box  with acceptable construction and a lock to  impede vandals as well as thieves.  Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle checking  mailboxes. A license number on a vehicle  along with a vehicle description would go a  long way to putting an end to this activity.   If you experience mail theft, notify the BCSO  (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876- 2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856-6347  and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in  progress notify BCSO and Security.   What to do with that  Christmas tree?  You may take it to the Eagle  Rock Landfill Transfer  Station (857-8318) where  the City mulches it, or you can just put it out  with your regular trash, but the trees must be  cut in half if taller than 6 feet.       SNOW REMOVAL  Most of the roads  within Sandia Heights  are County  roads/streets. There are  a few private roads. . The County is  responsible for removing snow from the  public roads. If you need maintenance on  your road/street, including snow removal,  please call the County at 848-1503    SHHA wants your thoughts on  GRIT publication schedule!  SHHA GRIT schedule change will be  considered during 2016 for possible  implementation in January 2017.  We want to  improve the quality of articles in the GRIT,  reduce the number of reprinted articles, save  office staff & SHHA Directors time gathering,  proofing, and editing articles each month.  The  latter activity sometimes takes up to 10 days  elapsed time each month, severely impacting  people’s busy schedules.   We request:   1) Members think about an  SHHA GRIT being printed every other month  rather than monthly.   2) If you’d like, give us  you feedback at the Feb 6th 2016 Annual  meeting during the Town Hall discussions.    3) And/or after the Annual meeting send SHHA a letter or an email with the Subject  Line “GRIT publication feedback” any time  before June 1, 2016.     The Communications & Publications  Committee of the SHHA will consider any  and all ideas and comments to help us improve  how we communicate with member residents  and others.    The C&P Committee members are Anne  Manning, Burt O’Neil, George Connor, Cindy  Mottle, and SHHA office staff.   Insert Page The GRIT – January 2016 – Volume – 32 - No. 1  New Board Candidates Biographies:  Carnie Abajian  I have been a resident of Sandia Heights since November 2014.

Initially, only 5% of residents participated in this program, but this number has now grown to  involve over 80% of residents.  Since each person produces about 1600 pounds of waste each year,  and over 50% of this is recyclable, our efforts to “Go Green” have been impressive.  So where does this recycling go?  Sandia Heights contracts with the same company as Albuquerque  proper, and therefore our recyclables are delivered to the Friedman Company.  They are the largest  paper recycler in the Southwest, with three processing plants in Phoenix, Tucson, and El Paso.  Our  waste is happily turned into paper towels, newspapers, trash bags, laundry detergent bottles, new  cans, and even car bumpers, as examples.   Recycling also conserves energy and resources needed to  produce these items from raw material, and it also reduces the tons of waste dumped in our landfills.    Not only is recycling good for the environment, but Sandia Heights receives a “rebate” based on the tons  of material received each year.  This rebate is used to offset some of the costs of recycling, allowing this  service to be free for residents.  If you currently are not recycling, how can you get into this program?  Simply call Sandia Heights  Services at 856-6419 to request up to one free green topped recycle bin, 96 gallon or 64 gallon, be   Continued on page 7 Specializing in Sandia He ights MAX SANCHEZ  Real Estate f : ; Ban 228-828 Over 27. eare . ee  Estate YOUR NEIGHBOR AND TRUSTED ADVISORS  sandial teresacordo  Max and Teresa have worked together for the past 17 years in  |W ATERWISE LANDSCAPES  INCORPORATED)  www.waterwiselandscapesnm.com [DESIGN #26 INSTALLATION 2% MAINTENANCE.  605-344-7508 _..505-350-2839  SPECIALIINGIN SANDIA HEIGHTS AND NORTH  ‘ALBUQUERQUE ACRES FOR OVER 18 YEARS.
