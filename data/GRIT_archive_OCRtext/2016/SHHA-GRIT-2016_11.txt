All changes must be received before Friday  November 4, 2016 in order for them to be included in the 2017 Resident  Directory.    Balloon Fiesta is Gone, the Pretty Leaves are Gone and the  RV’s Should be Gone    It's that time of year to return your toys to their storage site, which is not your  backyard or driveway.  Part of the cost of ownership of big toys is off-site storage  fees.  There are many storage companies close to Sandia Heights that would love  to look at your toys all year.  Please move them and store them.    Rental Property    If you rent property please make upkeep and following Covenants part of your  rental agreement.  We have talked to several renters who say they were never told  that they couldn't park their 35 foot RV in their driveway.  Be sure your renters  have a copy of the covenants before they sign a rental agreement.  As a  homeowner please keep your property in an appealing manner - one that you  would like to live next door to.  When you neglect landscaping and painting it  affects your investment as well as that of the neighborhood.      2   The GRIT – November 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 11                                                                                                        HEAT PUMP TIPS  Some Sandia Heights homes have heat pumps for  heating and cooling instead of gas. Since they use  electricity, heat pumps can be very expensive to run,  particularly in the winter.    The good news is, that despite your PNM bill  increase, heat pumps are more efficient than direct  combustion (gas or oil) because they use renewable  energy in the form of low-temperature heat.  Heat  flows naturally from a higher to a lower  temperature. Heat pumps, however, are able to force  the heat flow in the direction needed for cooling or  warming.  Advice from local HVAC companies and PNM  added to one homeowner’s costs. Here are some tips  for the most efficient use of your heat pumps:    Set your thermostat at one temperature.  Constant adjusting can cause higher utility  costs, especially in the winter.    If using your thermostat as a setback type,  limit the setbacks to twice a day such as  when you are at work and when you are  sleeping.    Only setback the thermostat 6% of desired  temperature (approximately five degrees).    Do not use the EMHEAT (emergency heat)  mode, as it uses more electricity, unless you  are returning from traveling for a few days.    During the heating season, try not to set the  thermostat below 65 degrees. If you choose  to set the thermostat lower when traveling,  you can use the EM setting to heat your  home quickly when you return.   Make it a habit to look at the outdoor heat  pump during the winter months for signs of  excessive ice or snow build-up on or around the  heat pump, especially after bad weather.   Do not use any sharp objects to pick or knock  the ice off the coils of the heat pump. This  could cause severe damage and personal injury.   Once the unit is clear of snow and ice turn the  thermostat back to normal heating. If the unit  ices up again, call for service.   Do not let the outdoor unit sit underneath a  leaking gutter. In the winter months, water will  drip on the top of the unit and freeze solid. This  will restrict the air flow and cause the whole  unit to freeze-up.   Heat Pumps should be elevated 4 to 8 inches  above ground level to keep coils clear of snow  and ice and to allow for proper drainage.  Contact your HVAC contractor if you would  like your unit raised.   In the cooling mode, try not to set the  thermostat below 70 degrees. Besides higher  utility costs, this can cause the indoor coil to  freeze and cause condensation in the house.

Our roads are narrow and winding, and  are used by bicycles and pedestrians as well as by  cars. We don’t have sidewalks for pedestrians to use,  nor do we want them—sidewalks would change the  unique character of our community, and not for the  better. The natural vegetation growing along the  roads is also an important part of the look of Sandia  Heights. The problem arises when the vegetation  grows right up to the edge of the road or even out  over the road, obscuring sight lines at intersections  and preventing people who are walking from getting  off the road when cars go by. None of us wants an  accident to happen because of this situation!  As you are aware, property owners are responsible  for maintaining the County right-of-way, which is  the part of your property next to the edge of the road.  While the County right-of-way extends about seven  feet from the edge of the road, the area we’re  concerned with in this article is the three-foot-wide  area right next to the road. Maintaining this area  includes removing vegetation (such as chamisa) and  keeping grasses and other native plants trimmed to  preserve sight lines and allow pedestrians to walk on  that area if necessary.  If property owners do not maintain the County right- of-way, the County can and will mow these areas to  ensure clear lines of sight. The County usually mows  the first three or four feet. SHHA and the County  Public Works Department frequently get calls from  residents asking for cutting and mowing of roadside  brush. SHHA and the County also get many calls  from residents objecting to cutting and mowing that  has taken place. The reality is that when the County  mows the roadsides, they mow over chamisa,  grasses, cactus, juniper saplings, wildflowers, and  whatever else is growing there, and the results are  not attractive. In addition to the unsightly result of  ragged bare branches, mowing chamisa does not  eliminate the problem—it just stimulates the  chamisa to grow more vigorously. We individual  homeowners can do a much tidier job, and indeed  we should be doing it anyway. The County cannot  accommodate individual requests to opt out of  mowing; however, they will not mow sections of the  road that are well enough maintained not to need  mowing.   So here’s the deal: If you don’t like the way the  roadsides look when the County mows them, you  must take the initiative and groom the sides of the  roads along your property. This means removing  chamisa and other woody plants (that is, digging  them out by the roots) and either cutting short or  trimming and thinning grasses and wildflowers to  preserve sight lines and provide an “escape route”  for pedestrians. Bernalillo County has told SHHA  that if you keep the right-of-way trimmed along your  property, they will refrain from mowing that  section. It may be a lot of work initially, but the  results will be worth the effort. Neighbors could  pool their efforts to periodically clean up and trim an  entire street. It’s a great way to get to know each  other, and it’s a good feeling to know that you’re  working together to keep Sandia Heights looking the  way we want it to!        Bernalillo County Ordinance  Regarding Animals:    The Bernalillo County Ordinance No. 88-16  Section VI. E. states “Animal Nuisances on  Sidewalks, Public Parks, Alleys, and Other Places  Open to the Public. It is unlawful for the owner of  any animal to permit, either willfully or through  failure to exercise due care of control, any such  animal to commit any nuisance upon the sidewalk  or public park; or upon the floor or wall of any  common hall in any multiple dwelling; or upon  any entrance way, stairway or wall immediately  abutting on a public sidewalk, or upon the floor or  wall of any theater, shop, store, office building or  other building used in common by the public; or  upon any private property other than the owners of  the animal.” Leaving your dog’s mess is not only  unsightly but also inconsiderate. Please be  considerate of your neighbors and pick up your  dog’s waste material.  4   The GRIT – November 2014 – Volume 30 – No. 11                                                                                                        SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop    Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and recycle  collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association membership.

A TALE OF TWO COVENANTS  By Dick Wavrik, CSC Chairman    When the Tram Company developed Sandia Heights  the area was divided into Units.  Each Unit had  restrictive covenants (Architectural and Use). There are  over 30 of these Units and their related covenants.  In  1995 the Tram Co. assigned their right to enforce the  covenants to the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA).  Now it gets complicated in that  developers, in the higher density Units, developed  enclaves or entire Units with their own covenants and  homeowner associations.  This was necessitated by the  common areas that would require long term  maintenance.  Landowners that bought in these areas  were left with two sets of covenants - the enclave and  the Tram Company.   Which ones are you required to follow? Maybe both.    SHHA will only enforce the version (Tram Company  or North Tramway Estates) that we are the legal  assignees.  If you have another set you should work  with that homeowners association first; however,  SHHA will continue to do enforcement in accordance  with the overall Unit covenants (found on the SHHA  website).  If you have questions the ACC and CSC will  try to help you.  Remember, SHHA did not make the  covenants, we cannot change them, we can only  enforce them.      IF YOU ARE A RESPONSIBLE HOME  OWNER DO NOT READ!  By Dick Wavrik, CSC Chairman    This is meant for the irresponsible homeowner that  ignores their covenants and the repeated violation  letters from the SHHA Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) and the SHHA attorney.  You agreed to abide  by the restrictive covenants of your Unit when you  purchased your property.  These included both  architectural and use restrictions.  Somehow over the  years you decided that they did not apply to you (only  your neighbors).  This results in complaints requiring  CSC investigation and letters asking for compliance -  that you ignore.  Further legal action is required (either  attorney letters or Court action) which gets very  expensive to your responsible neighbors.  Please read your covenants as they define your rights  as well as what you cannot do.  If you get a letter from  SHHA reminding you of a violation please take care of  it.  Don't waste our volunteers time and SHHA dues  money by requiring us to do further actions.    Special Use Permits and the ACC  Approval Process  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman      Since the mid-1960s, Sandia Heights has  grown into a community of about 2200 residences  located in 41 individual development units.  Each of  these units has its own set of covenants.  Following its  inception in 1972, the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA) was established as a New Mexico  non-profit corporation in 1975.  Twenty years later in  1995, the original developer, Sandia Peak Tram  Company, transferred the covenant enforcement and  architectural control functions to SHHA and that  arrangement remains in effect to this day.    Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – November 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 11                                                                                                     Continued from page 7  The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) and the  Architectural Control Committee (ACC) are the SHHA  committees that have those enforcement  responsibilities for all of our units. And we continue to  grow!  Our newest unit, Hawks Landing, just east of  the intersection of Paseo del Norte and Tramway  Boulevard, will begin its 33-home development in  mid-2017.    During the early years, the units in Sandia  Heights were approved by Bernalillo County’s zoning  and land planners to be developed as low density  residential units without the need for provisions and  restrictions contained in special use permits (SUPs).   As the community grew, many of the later units had  higher densities and, as such, were encumbered with  specific criteria identified in SUPs with the details of  those SUPs contained in the original Site Development  Plans (SDPs) for those units.  The SDPs for all of the  units within Sandia Heights show lot and street layouts  and other details including SUP restrictions.  The  County maintains records of the SDPs with the  associated SUP criteria and those documents serve as  guidelines when contractors apply for building permits  to either build new residences on vacant lots within the  units or to apply for modifications to residences  already existing in the units.  SHHA, the CSC, and the  ACC do not maintain SDPs in our archival records.  If  your residence is in a unit that has a SUP, your  contractor, when applying for building permits, needs  to be aware of  SUP criteria such as restrictions related  to setback distances, building heights, etc.  It is  ultimately the responsibility of the homeowner to  comply with applicable SUPs associated with the  relevant unit SDP.    Just as a reminder, building permits are not  needed for home repairs that are largely cosmetic such  as painting, flooring and carpeting.  A minor kitchen  remodel—new countertops and cabinets—won’t need a  permit unless fixtures are relocated or the space is  reconfigured.  Permits will be needed if an addition is  built onto the home, if electrical and mechanical tasks  are involved, and for most plumbing work.  Licensed  contractors should know when a building permit is  required and how to obtain those permits through the  County.  SHHA does not get involved in the permitting  process.  Once a project is approved by the ACC, it is  up to the homeowner and the respective contractors to  obtain the required permits and to be aware of any  specific provisions identified in SUPs for that unit  where the project will occur.  The County does have  internal administrative procedures for reviewing  requests for relief from criteria contained in SUPs and  for issues related to zoning categories.  You can  contact the County’s Planning & Development  Services Department regarding these procedures.  I  hope this article has been informative.  If you need  contacts at the County to answer questions regarding  their permitting process, contact the ACC.

We  thank our many friends and neighbors for making it such a great event.   Appreciation goes to Terry  Winfield at High Desert Frame and Gallery for the opportunity to display and sell our work at her  gallery at our Preview Night and through the month of September. Thanks also to Eric Guenette of  newmexicocreative.com for his graphic design talents.  We are already looking forward to next year’s  Artists Studio Tour!  See you in September.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are in our eleventh year of the Sandia  Heights “Cork & Fork” dinner group. We meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our  members. Each small group is usually three couples plus a host couple, with each couple  contributing to some part of the dinner menu.  All couples and singles are welcome.  The emphasis is  on food and fun rather than formal elegance.
