FIRE WEATHER WARNING    For the last month or so, the National Weather Service has been posting daily  warnings about increasing fire danger in New Mexico. The El Nino effects that  produced ample precipitation in the winter have waned considerably, causing  below average readings for February and March.  While most of our Covenants prohibit open burning and other careless fire  endangerment activities, we all need to be aware of fire danger due to our  proximity to Cibola National Forest, as well as the emphasis on allowing natural  growth to occur in arroyos and our properties.   The following information is provided courtesy of the Cibola National Forest  website:  To Report a Fire: CALL 911 or Albuquerque Zone Dispatch 505-346-2660.   Here are a few helpful tips if you should need to report a fire:   Stay calm and don't panic. Help will arrive as soon as possible.       Write down as much information about the fire as you can before you call to  report it.    Tell the dispatcher where you are calling from. If you are calling from a remote  area and are using a cell phone, give the dispatcher your location.   If you are calling from a remote area and do not have a map or cannot  pinpoint you location, give the operator a description of a nearby landmark or the  nearest highway or county road.   Give the dispatcher a description of what you are seeing. Is the smoke black  or white? Are flames visible? Are there people, or homes, nearby?   If the fire is close to your location and you are in danger, tell the dispatcher  and leave the area, as soon as possible.   Give your name and phone number.  If you are calling from your home,  give your address, too. This will help officials in locating you and locating the  fire.   If you live in or near a forested area, consider purchasing a National Forest or  County map. Learn how to read the map and become familiar with landmarks  and access roads. A map may help you in reporting a wildfire to authorities.   2   The GRIT – May 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 5                                                                                                      Keep Bears Wild    By Dave Mottle, Parks and Safety Chair    Bears started coming out of hibernation in  late March, and now, in May, they are  ranging further afield to find food.  Remember, they didn’t eat all winter, and  they’re hungry!   We want to keep our dwindling population of  bears in the Sandias wild, and the only way  to assure that they stay wild is by not having   anything on our property that would attract  them.   This means keeping garbage indoors and  not putting it out until the morning of trash  pickup, bringing bird feeders inside at  night (or stop feeding the birds during the  time bears are active, usually April through  mid-November), feeding pets indoors as  well as storing pet food and extra bird seed  inside the house or garage, and keeping  doors and windows closed and locked  after sunset. Please do your part to keep  our bears safe!    When NM Game and Fish removes bears  from the Sandias, the majority of those are  usually killed. These bears’ only crime was  taking advantage of food left easily available  by humans. Let’s make this a better year for  our bears!       Photo by Norma Leeper                  Pedestrian Safety Reminders    By Parks & Safety Committee    Safety is so very important, especially in  Sandia Heights, where there are no  sidewalks. With hilly and curvy roads, it is  difficult for drivers to see walkers and  joggers.     Pedestrian Safety Tips:  1. Walk on the Left side of the Road  Facing Traffic [This is a NM State  Law!]; make eye contact with drivers  approaching you.  2. Wear a reflective vest or brightly  colored clothing, particularly in the  evening. SHHA members can  purchase a vest in the office for only  $2!  3. If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.  4. Whenever vehicles approach, a  group of pedestrians should walk in  single file.  5. If you expect to be out before sunrise  or after sunset, please carry a light.  6. Observe the safety of our children  on or near our neighborhood  roads. Please be aware of children  walking and/or playing on or near our  narrow roads before and after school  and at school bus stops.            3   The GRIT – May 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 5                                                                                                        Hawks Landing Development  Update  (Note: Hawks Landing is the Mhoon  Property)  After extensive negotiations and discussion,  the parties (the Connors, the developers,  SHHA, and the Alliance of Sandia Heights  Neighborhoods) reached a final accord last  week on the Hawks Landing site plan and  the Conditions that will be a part of the site  plan.    Panorama agrees to withdraw the stand  alone R-2 zoning request and will use the  modified Special Use (SU) zoning instead,  when the County has approved the SU  application. The District Court case  involving the County and the Connors will  be dismissed upon approval of the Special  Use Permit (SUP).    Under the current plan, there will be 34-35  homes, including townhouses on the west  side closest to Tramway.    There will be a walking path by the  arroyo.  People will be able to  access the walking path on the north  side of the development by walking  through the path by the arroyo and  one of the roads in the development.    Panorama will implement Covenants for the  development similar to the North Tramway  Estates covenants. Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association will have the  ultimate authority to enforce the Covenants  after development is complete.     It is anticipated that the SUP will be  approved at the County’s May meeting.

Also, Membership in SHHA does not include Sandia Heights Security membership. You can call  Security to confirm your membership with them. If you have questions regarding the preceding stats,  please call Security 856-6347, mobile 263-4654.         Solicitors in Albuquerque are forbidden by law to knock on any door where a sign is posted,  clearly stating that solicitors are not welcome. Such signs should include the words: “No  Trespassing,” or “No Peddlers,” or “No Advertisements” or “No Soliciting”. The "no  trespassing" is especially important in addition to the "no solicitation" sign. Security  Officers can then ask the solicitor to leave private property. Remember virtually all of Sandia  Heights is County roadways, and there is no County ordinance that can keep them off the  roadways. Signs should be posted where they can be seen from the roadway.                  Sharon and Judson Believe in Doing Things Right for You! Call, or Text for a Free Market Analysis Today!

This is not a new issue  within our community, and at times  becomes a major irritant for other residents.   Although the published covenants for the  earliest developed units do not specifically  spell out RVs, the Second Judicial Court in  the late 1990s determined long-term parking  of RVs, camper trailers and boats on all  residential lots in Sandia Heights is  prohibited.  The court allowed parking of  such vehicles for a period of no more than  48 hours for maintenance and provisioning.        The CSC does not police the  neighborhood for violations; however, if a  complaint is received, your homeowners  association and the CSC will act upon it with  the full authority and backing of the judicial  system.  We would ask all residents with  RVs, travel trailers and boats to be good  neighbors and respect the rights of other  residents and adhere to the covenants.   Please keep in mind that the covenants are  here to ensure we can continue to live in a  pristine community and maintain the value  in our homes.      Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) Needs Volunteers   The CSC is looking for new members.  If  you are a member of the Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association (SHHA) and a  home owner please consider volunteering  for your Covenant Support Committee and  help ensure the enforcement of SHHA  covenants. We meet at the SHHA office  once a month and we have the excellent  back up of our SHHA staff.   Covenant  enforcement contributes significantly to  maintaining our property values and to  preserving our unique community. If you  would enjoy meeting with interesting,  concerned and fun neighbors who share  your appreciation of Sandia Heights please  consider joining the CSC.  You can volunteer by calling the SHHA  office at 505-797-7793.    Choosing Your Contractor    Bob Bower, Architectural Control  Committee (ACC) Chairman    My last article in the April 2016 GRIT  focused on the ACC’s Neighborhood  Review (NR) process.  Once the NR is  completed, the ACC, with your consent,  may make some adjustments to your  construction proposal based on comments  from your neighbors.  The ACC will then  proceed with its approval of your project.   Now it’s time, if you have not already done  so, to find a contractor for your home  improvement project.  Know who you are  dealing with when hiring a contractor—the  wrong choice may cost you lots of  headaches and money.    In today’s economy, many homeowners are  choosing to remodel their current homes  rather than deciding to purchase a new one.   But in order to cut costs, some homeowners  are hiring unlicensed and uninsured  contractors.      Continued on page 8    8   The GRIT – May 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 5                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    These contractors can become a sizeable liability  to the homeowner through shoddy workmanship  or by failing to complete the remodeling task.   Keep in mind that contracting without a license is  illegal in New Mexico and hiring unlicensed and  uninsured contractors has had a negative impact  on the local home remodeling industry.    There are plenty of unlicensed individuals in  today’s home remodeling market equipped with a  set of tools, a vehicle, and inferior remodeling  skills.    They deliver bids to the homeowner at prices too  good to be true!  Unfortunately, many of these  individuals end up getting hired for the  remodeling job. Remember the old adage:  “You  get what you pay for”, and this is very true for the  home remodeling industry.  The use of low  quality materials and shoddy workmanship can  go unnoticed for months or years.  The cost of  redoing poor work and paying for a licensed  contractor to build what was originally planned for  can be avoided by using some “up-front smarts”  when choosing the contractor in the first place.    The lack of proper insurance is one of the most  obvious and devastating ways construction costs  can be cut.  If a contractor should fall off the  homeowner’s roof, use faulty materials and  methods, or damage the homeowner’s home or  belongings, there is usually no coverage to  protect the homeowner.  In these circumstances,  the uninsured contractor cannot afford to pay for  personal injuries and other damages, leaving the  homeowner with an uncompleted project and, in  some cases, significant costs to settle claims  against the homeowner’s insurance policies.    If you have been the victim of unlicensed  contracting or would like more information on the  topic, you can visit the New Mexico Regulation  and Licensing Department’s Construction  Industries Division website at:   http://www.rld.state.nm.us/construction/constru ctions-industries-overview.aspx Note:  When  hiring a contractor, look for license number,  liability coverage, and workers’ compensation.   Don’t be afraid to ask for copies of these  documents to make sure they are up to date.   Good luck with your home improvement projects.   Remember to provide comments (pro and con) to  the SHHA office for inclusion in our contractor  evaluation books so other members       can take advantage of your experiences with  your contractors.
