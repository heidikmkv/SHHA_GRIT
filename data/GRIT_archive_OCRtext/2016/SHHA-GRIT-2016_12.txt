December  2016                          Vol. 32 – No. 12 “MEET AND GREET” SUCCESS CONTINUES WITH CAPTAIN  KINGSBURY OF BERNALILLO COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE  Thursday October 13 Meet and Greet drew almost 80 residents to the Church of  the Good Shepherd. Bob Bower, SHHA Vice-President, welcomed the attendees,  and then turned the meeting over to Captain Joshua Kingsbury. President John  Chavez and Vice President Larry Buynak from Sandia Heights Services (SHS)  also attended and participated in the question and answer period.  Captain Kingsbury stated he had been recently assigned to the North Area  Command (of which Sandia Heights is a part). He welcomed questions from the  audience, noting that the attendance far exceeded the Southwest Area Command  neighborhood meetings with which he was formerly associated.   When questions were asked about increasing SHS patrols, Vice President Buynak  pointed out that there are fifty-two miles of roads in Sandia Heights, and SHS puts  in over four thousand miles per month patrolling the area.  The topics discussed were mostly focused on security issues, with discussions on  whether to install home alarms or cameras, whether residents should bear arms,  etc. One resident pointed out the advantage of getting to know your neighbors  well enough to be able to watch out for any activity that does not fit in with what  is considered ‘normal’ activity for the area.   The meeting was adjourned at 8 pm. SHHA will schedule another event in May  2017.  A LETTER FROM YOUR VICE PRESIDENT—BOB BOWER  Over the last eight months, I have attended four meetings and all of them  dealt with the issue of criminal activity in Sandia Heights and in other  neighborhoods in our vicinity.  Two meetings (12 May and 13 October) were  sponsored by SHHA with the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO).   Another on 18 October was sponsored by Citizens for Safety—Far Northeast  Heights and was organized by Jim and Denise Dobier who are residents of Sandia  Heights and are victims of a recent home invasion.  The last one was on 26  October and was organized by John Betak, President of the Alliance of Sandia  Heights Neighborhoods (ASHN) with significant participation by Sandia Heights  Services (SHS).  All four of these meetings were held in response to residents  who have expressed concerns about the rise in criminal activities based on  personal experiences and on numerous articles that have recently appeared in the  Albuquerque Journal and on local TV networks. The largest increases are related  to property crimes.  Although the Far Northeast Heights is one of the safest areas  of the County, there have been increases in overall criminal activity in this area  and those increases do not seem to be abating.  2   The GRIT –December 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 12                                                                                                      Continued from page one    Let’s concentrate on SHHA for the moment.  There  is nothing in our founding bylaws or our committee  charters specifying that SHHA has a responsibility  to provide community security services.  Sandia  Heights relies on SHS and BCSO for those services.   The security provided by SHS is hampered due to a  lack of funds that are needed to provide 24/7 patrol  coverage of the community.  Subscription by our  residents for SHS security services is not mandatory  and, as such, SHS is unable to provide 24/7  coverage due to a low subscription rate.  BCSO  provides law enforcement services.  It operates on a  priority basis and activities related to property  crimes are prioritized along with many other  criminal activities which often lead to inadequate  response times if there are higher priority crimes in  progress.  Bottom Line:  funding for both BCSO  and SHS is limited in terms of hiring and training  personnel to complement their existing assets.    When SHHA was involved in the  preparation of the covenants for the North Tramway  Estates (NTE) development, the developers were  asked to insist on mandatory membership in SHHA  and for SHS security services for those 14  residences.  The developers agreed.  We plan to get  the same wording into the 33-home Hawks Landing  covenants since the developers (they plan on starting  construction in mid-2017) are the same ones who  are building NTE.  Including those two new  developments, SHHA is composed of 41 individual  units and each of those units has its own set of  covenants.  SHHA does not “own” any of these unit  covenants—the units control their covenants.  Each  unit can change its covenants to require mandatory  membership in SHHA and/or for SHS security  services.  Most of the unit covenants require 75% of  its residents to agree to covenant changes.  One way  to get more resources for both SHHA and SHS is for  the individual units to mount a vigorous campaign  to make those changes.  Right now, about 70% of  our residents are members of SHHA, and SHS has a  similar percentage for their security services.  If the  units want to change their covenants to include  mandatory membership just for the SHS services,  that’s acceptable to SHHA, since SHHA is  adequately funded at this time to meet its  community obligations.  Although there may be a  way, right now I don’t see a path that would allow  SHHA to force all of its units to make changes to  their covenants.  I challenge the Dobiers and the  residents of their unit (South Unit 27C) to initiate an  effort to make those covenant changes and to get  them properly recorded with the County.  Success in  this endeavor may incentivize other units to also  make these covenant changes.    As a result of these meetings, SHHA’s Parks  and Safety Committee will be considering various  ideas on how to enhance our community’s security.   Some of our residents have suggested looking at  installing signage similar to our “bear” signs that  would warn individuals entering the community that  it is monitored by armed patrols.  Another  suggestion is that SHHA investigate the possibility  of using surveillance cameras with store-dump  capabilities placed at strategic locations within the  community.    From a more global perspective, I  recommend that residents contact Lonnie Talbert,  our District 4 County Commissioner, regarding  concerns related to criminal activities in our District.   I realize that many of us like quality of life efforts  that are funded by our County and the City of  Albuquerque, but are all of these efforts needed  when our police and sheriff departments are  critically short of personnel necessary to accomplish  their basic missions?  Also, remember that you are  responsible for securing your residence.  There are  lots of ways to enhance the security of your  residence (security doors, window treatments,  cameras, intrusion sensors, alarms, etc.).  Learn  about these and use them if they are appropriate for  your residence.  The meeting sponsored by the  Dobiers featured three commercial entities  specializing in various solutions to security  problems.  Contact the Dobiers for additional  details.    Security Reminder:  Whenever possible park your car in the garage  rather than just in the driveway and remember not to  leave valuables or the garage door opener in your  car (particularly gifts visible in the car at this time of  the year).    3   The GRIT –December 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 12                                                                                                         Sandia Homeowners Backyard  Ski Area  By Burt O’Neil, Communications & Publications    We see the west side of the Sandia Mountains  from our Sandia Heights (SH) homes and marvel  at the spectacular shear granite and limestone  cliffs. When looking at the walls of stone, one  thinks of rock climbing not skiing. However, the  east side of the Sandia Mountains is a beautiful  micro climate of forest and rolling hills, ideal for  downhill and cross country skiing. The Sandia  Mountains top out at 10,600 feet and the elevation  ensures an average of 120 inches of winter  snowfall.   There is a very unique way for SH residents to get  to the ski area. In 1964 a major tramway was built.  Below is a picture of the tram just after a major  snowstorm.        SH association members can go to the SHHA  office and obtain tickets at a reduced cost of  $6.00 (beginning January 2017). This Tram  takes a skier to the top of “Exhibition” ski run.  Besides the incredible views, the Tram is a very  convenient 15‐minute ride to the ski area. The  alternative is to drive one hour to the east side  of the mountains. The base of the Tram is  directly adjacent to the North part of Sandia  Heights.  The Sandia Ski area has 30 major ski runs.  Some of these runs are over two miles long.      Above is a picture of skiers and boarders at top of  “Aspen” run. The vertical rise of 1,700 feet allows  for some of the longest runs in New Mexico.  There is an excellent beginners’ ski area at the  base of the ski runs. This area is served by two  lifts. Most of the runs are for intermediate skiers  but there are a few runs for advanced skiers. Last  year I skied “Suicide” run which was in excellent  shape. This is a run for advanced skiers but rarely  has enough skiable snow. The slope difficulty is:  easiest 35%, more difficult 55% and most difficult  10%. My two favorite runs are “Double Eagle” on  the north side of the area and “La Madera” on the  south side. These are two long, picturesque runs  through a winter wonderland. From the upper  mountain runs one can see clear over to the Santa  Fe ski area, a distance of 70 miles.  For up to date information on rates, snow  conditions, and weather, go to  www.sandiapeak.com.            SNOW REMOVAL  Most of the roads within  Sandia Heights are County  roads/streets;  there are a few  private roads. If you need maintenance on your  road/street, including snow removal, please call the  county at 848-1503. The county is responsible for  removing snow from the public roads.   4   The GRIT – December 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 12          HOLIDAY SECURITY TIPS:    With the holidays fast approaching, potential burglars or thieves will prey upon targets of opportunity, and  vulnerabilities exist that many don’t think about especially during the hectic holidays. Here are some tips from the  Sandia Heights Security Patrol:  If you display your Christmas tree in a window, don’t put your presents under the tree where they can be easily seen from the road.  This is an open invitation for a thief. When you return home from holiday shopping, pull your car into the garage and close the garage door before unloading your gifts from the trunk.  If it is not possible to do this, take a look around before you unload the vehicle. Never leave gifts in the trunk or back of your vehicle outside overnight.  If someone will go to the trouble to steal your stereo or other valuables, they will certainly try to take items that are on the backseat or in the trunk as well. If you must leave vehicles parked in a driveway or on the street, remove the garage door opener. Contact the Sandia Heights Security Patrol for a special security watch if you are going to be away from your home.

Residents are advised not leave mail in mailboxes,  either incoming or outgoing. If you cannot retrieve your mail promptly ask a trusted neighbor to get it for you. If  you are leaving town suspend your mail delivery - have it held at the Post Office.  If you have mail that would be considered sensitive, you may want to mail it at a USPS office. Another suggestion  might be to replace your mailbox with either a heavy duty locking type or totally enclosing the box  with acceptable construction and a lock to impede vandals as well as thieves.  Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle checking mailboxes. A license number on a vehicle along with a vehicle  description would go a long way to putting an end to this activity.  If you experience mail theft, notify the BernCo.  Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876-2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856- 6347 and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in progress notify BCSO and Security.

If you live  near such a person please be understanding as "it  too will pass".  If you do put up lights please be  considerate of your neighbors and turn off the  lights at an early hour, unplug Frosty's blower, and  refrain from outside holiday music.    If you plan on having a holiday party please think  ahead about guest parking.  Tell your guests not to  park in your neighbors drive or on their lawn and  not block the road, as emergency vehicles may  have to get through.

We meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our members. Each small group is usually  three couples plus a host couple, with each couple contributing to some part of the dinner menu.  All couples and  singles are welcome.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. We’re always happy to have new  folks join us, so if this sounds like an activity that you might be interested in, please contact Linda Mason at  lindamason307@gmail.com or 505-554-2934.
