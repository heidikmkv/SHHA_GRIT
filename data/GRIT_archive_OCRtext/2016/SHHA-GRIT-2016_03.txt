It is on the SHHA website, and is published  below.  • SHHA has officially assumed CSC  responsibilities of North Tramway Estates  (NTE). ACC responsibilities will be  transferred to SHHA at a later time. NTE does  require mandatory membership.  • SHHA worked with the County on the drag  racing issue. The County passed a Vehicle  Seizure and Forfeiture Ordinance, which took  effect on January 8, 2016.  • SHHA worked with the Art Council on a  proposal for metal sculptures for the WL  Jackson Park.  • SHHA hired Amanda Allen as the new Office  Administrator. The office staff works very  hard and SHHA is happy to have them.  • The July 2013 Home Owners Act (HOA)  procedures were reviewed to ensure  compliance. The HOA makes certain  information available to members. SHHA  accessible information required by the HOA  can be found on the SHHA website or by  requesting the required information in writing.       Mhoon Property Update    At a hearing held December 2, 2015, the  Bernalillo County Planning Commission voted  unanimously to change the zoning designation  on the Mhoon property from A-1 to R-2 with no  development restrictions.  SHHA’s counsel  testified against the R-2 decision because there  would be no development restrictions, no  covenant requirements, and because straight R-2  zoning is inconsistent with the zoning of the  surrounding properties. The properties to the  north and south of the Mhoon property, along  the Tramway corridor, have mainly been  developed pursuant to Special Use Permits  (SUP).  The 8 acre plus undeveloped Mhoon  property is located at the easternmost end of  Paseo del Norte as it T’s into Tramway  Boulevard.       After the Planning Commission’s decision, the  SHHA Board of Directors determined the  interests of Sandia Heights residents would be  best protected through direct communication  with development representatives to work  toward a resolution of the issues.   We initiated  and coordinated discussions with all interested  parties and a settlement has been mediated that  will require: 1) implementation of an SUP  governing the development, which would be  enforceable by the County, including site  conditions requiring flat, parapeted roofs, earth  tone stucco colors, height restrictions, and no  exterior street lights; 2) a withdrawal by  Panorama Homes of the R-2 zoning request  upon the Commission’s approval of the SU  application; 3) that the arroyo be subject to  AMAFCA requirements, with a trail on the  northern boundary of the arroyo and open space  with natural vegetation, with input from  interested parties as to the specifics; and 4) that  SHHA have ultimate authority to enforce  acceptable covenants after the development is  complete. Presently, the site plan will have 34- 35 homes including  townhouses along  Tramway Boulevard. The developer’s original  proposal was for 36 homes.

The  policy can be found in the  SHHA Rules and Regulations  for the Association under the  Board tab.   Continued from the front page    The hearing on the appeals of the Planning Commission’s  December 2, 2015 zoning decision and the issue of whether the  Board of County Commissioners would approve the R-2 zoning  application was set for February 16, 2016. The County has sent  out notices to anyone who signed up to speak at the December 2  hearing.     The County and the parties, including SHHA,  appealing the  December 2 decision have requested that the matter of approval of  the R-2 application be deferred to allow for finalization of the  settlement agreement between all parties. The County  Commissioners will decide whether to approve the deferral on  February 16.      When the settlement agreement is approved, the conditions set  forth above would govern the development of the property and  result in certainty as to how the property will be developed with  enforceable covenants.     SHHA Secretary Report ~ George Connor, SHHA  Secretary    The Secretary has overseen the production of the Board meeting  minutes, certified the presence of a quorum for the conduct of  business, ensured the published notification of the annual  meeting, and ensured the preparation and filing of  the Association's annual report for non-profit corporations to the  State.

The 2016 SHHA Budget:   • After reviewing the proposed 2016 budget at its  December 9th meeting, the Board approved the  budget.   • The Finance Committee developed the budget  based on the current and projected reserves and the  revenues needed to cover the services needed by  the property owners.  • The Board maintained the dues at $8.00/month for  2016.  • This allows for a reasonable targeted Net Income.   Each year the income and expenses will be  reviewed to establish the best course of action for  the following years.   • Budgets are projections which may change as the  year progresses, so please go to the Finance tab on  the Board section of the SHHA web site for  current details. The Budget vs actual will be  posted on the website on a monthly basis.

Annual Report from the Parks & Safety  Committee ~   George Connor, 2015 Chair    During calendar year 2015 we had 4 Parks & Safety  meetings, and took care of many issues with  Bernalillo County and in and around Sandia Heights.     Issues discussed and worked on include the  following:  1. Resolved issues with Chamisa, weed, and  trees in right-of-way with the help of  Bernalillo County & New Mexico  Department of Transportation road  personnel.  2. Major Project – Helped residents get dead  trees cut and removed by obtaining  discounts with landscape companies during  August, September and October. We  measured the results of this program before  and after and realized a 50% reduction in  dead trees across Sandia Heights.     The P&S Committee members are George Connor  (Chair), Bill Wiley, Burt O’Neil, Dave Mottle,  Emily Rudin, Ross Schneider, and Susanne  Schneider.     4   The GRIT – March 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 3                                                                                                          BERNCO AND SHS REPORT INCREASE IN MAIL THEFT           Bernalillo County and Sandia Heights Services both report recent increases in mail theft, with BernCo  reporting mail sacks being stolen from USPS trucks, in addition to smash-and-grab  techniques for both  cluster and individual mail boxes. The increase is thought to be related to thieves’ interest in tax forms,  such as W-2’s, to use in identity theft attempts.  Stealing mail is a federal offense punishable by fine or five years in prison, according to the federal legal  code.  If you experience mail theft or see anyone in a vehicle checking mailboxes, notify the BernCo. Sheriff’s  Office (BCSO) (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876-2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856- 6347 and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in progress notify BCSO and Security.

It manages the architectural  control process for SHHA by approving all  changes to the external appearance of properties  within the community (e.g., new construction,  additions, remodels, landscaping). There has been  a decline over the past three years of larger  projects, particularly new construction on the few  remaining vacant lots within the community.  As  such, the ACC now concentrates most of its  efforts on remodeling projects.  Depending on the  scope of these efforts, the ACC may conduct  neighborhood reviews to obtain inputs on these  proposed projects from nearby neighbors.    The ACC meets on the first and third  Wednesdays of the month and throughout most of  2015 the Committee had seven active members.   Guidelines (these are on the SHHA website) are  published and are periodically updated to assist  residents with design projects.  The ACC also  maintains a Project Log on the website which  displays all current ACC projects.  The GRIT  also lists the projects approved for the month.   Articles are routinely published in the GRIT to  help educate the residents on the ACC process  and on a variety of other topics.  A list of titles of   GRIT articles published in a given year is always  summarized in the January edition of the next  year.    In 2015, the ACC processed a total of 324  projects which was a slight increase over the 309  projects approved in 2014.  The Committee  continued to work with the County on new  development efforts within the community;  namely, North Tramway Estates (NTE) and the  Hawks Landing developments. This latter effort  is also known as the Mhoon Property  Development.  Several of the 14 homes planned  for the NTE have been completed and some have  been sold.  The Hawks Landing project will most  likely be approved sometime in 2016.        The ACC will continue to keep the community  informed on the following efforts:    --PNM rate hike decisions.    --Additional changes to the County’s  Wastewater Ordinance and how those  changes will affect our residents who own  septic systems.    --The Hawks Landing development effort.

When looking at the  walls of stone one thinks of rock climbing not skiing. However, the east side of the  Sandia Mountains is a beautiful micro climate of forest and rolling hills, ideal for  downhill and cross country skiing. The Sandia Mountains top out at 10,600 feet and  the elevation ensures an average of 120 inches of winter snowfall. As of now  (1/28/2016) there is over 110 inches of total snowfall and 45inches on the ski  trails.       There is a very unique way for SH residents to get to the ski area. In 1964 a major  tramway was built. Below is a picture of the tram just after a major snowstorm.        SH association members can go to the SHHA office and obtain tickets at a reduced  cost of $5.00. This tram takes a skier to the top of “Exhibition” ski run. Besides the  incredible views, the tram is a very convenient 15‐minute ride to the ski area. The  alternative is to drive one hour to the east side of the mountains. The base of the  tram is directly adjacent to the North part of Sandia Heights.     The Sandia Ski area has 30 major ski runs. Some of these runs are over two miles long.  The ski area currently has over 40 inches of snow and is operating Friday,       Saturday and Sunday.  Above is a picture of skiers and boarders at top of “Aspen”  run.  The vertical rise of 1,700 feet allows for some of the longest runs in New  Mexico. There is an excellent beginners ski area at the base of the ski runs. This area  is served by two lifts. Most of the runs are for intermediate skiers but there are a  few runs for advanced skiers. Just recently I skied “Suicide” run which was in  excellent shape.  This is a run for advanced skiers and except for this year, rarely has  enough skiable snow. The slope difficulty is: easiest 35%, more difficult 55% and  most difficult 10%. There is a restaurant, “High Finance” at the top of the mountain  offering spectacular views and also a restaurant at the base. My two favorite runs  are “Double Eagle” on the north side of the area and “La Madera” on the south side.  These are two long, picturesque runs through a winter wonderland. From the upper  mountain runs one can see clear over to the Santa Fe ski area, a distance of 70 miles.
