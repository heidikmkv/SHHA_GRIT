In my article entitled  "Annual Report from the President" that was published in the March edition of  the GRIT, I stated that SHHA worked with the County on the drag racing issue  and that the County subsequently passed an ordinance related to that issue.   Although SHHA did work with Commissioner Talbert in his effort to get this  ordinance passed, the lion's share of the credit goes to John Betak, President of  the Alliance of Sandia Heights Neighborhoods (ASHN). I feel that I should give  credit where credit is due and, as such, I want to make sure that the community  understands that John Betak was the major driving force behind the efforts that  led to the eventual enactment of this very important ordinance.

Completion time is estimated at four  months.“Collaboration is what turns an idea into a reality within a community,”  says Commissioner Lonnie Talbert. “Bernalillo County thanks State  Representative Bill Rehm and State Senator Mark Moores for the legislative  funding we received to design and construct the new direct access to Paseo del  Norte Boulevard.” This item has been on the SHHA Bernalillo County Capital  Improvement Plan (CIP) request the last 4 -6 years. The GRIT thanks the  Sandia Heights resident who reported this news to the SHHA.   ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞  2   The GRIT – April 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 4                                                                                                    ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞  ABQ FILM SHOWS DANGERS OF  LOCAL CYCLING    The number of New Mexico cycling deaths is  second only to Florida. That rate is 50% higher  than the country as a whole. This is what  inspired Chris Schueler to film the  documentary, “HIKERS, BIKERS AND  AUTOMOBILES Pedestrian and Cyclist  Safety”.   The production filmed in Albuquerque and the  surrounding areas, often focusing on rural  roads, where the infrastructure isn’t available  for cyclists. It was produced by Emmy Award  winning Christopher Productions, LLC in  association with SafeTeen New Mexico;  sponsors for the program include NM Dept. of  Transportation, Bernalillo County Substance  Abuse Prevention, the City of Albuquerque,  State Farm Insurance and Bike ABQ. For  more information, visit  http://nmbikepedsafety.info/ .  According to the Mid Region Metro Planning  Organization, 1,684 cyclists were treated for  injuries in 2013. In Bernalillo County,  Alcohol-involved Pedal cycle Crashes have  almost doubled from 2010 to 2012 (7 to 13),  according to the New Mexico Dept. of  Transportation DWI report 2012.

Recently more than 1300 travel  agents and agency owners were surveyed by  Travel Leaders, one of North America’s  largest travel companies, about the top trends  they’re seeing for 2016, including the growing  area of leisure travel. Three European  destinations were among the top five luxury  vacation spots:  European river cruises are at  the very top, followed by adventures in Italy,  and Mediterranean cruises. Rounding out the  top five are Caribbean cruises and Australia.  Whether you’re talking about sailing along a  European river, through the Mediterranean or  in the Caribbean, cruises have some things in  common. The voyages are generally all- inclusive and the ships tend to be smaller, with  more spacious accommodations and a greater  level of amenities such as gourmet dining, a  high staff-to-passenger ratio and unique shore  excursions.   Many focus on longer stays,  allowing travelers to immerse themselves in  European history and culture.    For land-based destinations, such as Italy, a  vacation offers travelers more opportunities to  customize their trip. They can select top-of- the-line hotels and resorts, smaller tours and  an itinerary that appeals to their interests. For  some, that could be a specific region such as  sun-drenched Tuscany, the gorgeous Amalfi  coast or the grand cities of Venice, Florence  and Rome. Others may want to focus on a  particular topic, such as wine and food or art  and history.      Travelers in search of unique and adventurous  experiences, may want to try one of the  survey’s top up-and-coming destinations: A  trip to Cuba can be priceless for Americans  who want to be among the first to visit the  island in the wake of normalized relations.  People-to-people tours allowed under U.S. law  give visitors a level of interaction they  wouldn’t get on a typical vacation, with visits  to schools, businesses and cultural  organizations.

This month we focus on  Communications and Publications:  Anne Manning, C&P volunteer and BOD  member, has writing and editing experience,  has lived in various units since 1990, worked  the 2010 census, and also is a volunteer at the  Botanic Garden. She wants to help other  residents enjoy and protect Sandia Heights.   Burt O’Neil, C&P volunteer, enjoys the  internet/website part of C&P, and is interested  in helping members get online, as well as  encouraging more electronic communication  between SHHA and its residents. His  professional credentials include Electro- Optics, Satellite Imaging, and HTML job  script. He recommended the business that  currently manages the SHHA website.  Cindy Mottle, Chair, moved to Sandia Heights  February 1, 2015, was elected to the BOD in  April, and was elected Chair by the  Committee in December. She has a  Technology and Education background. She  published Albuquerque SCORE’s Newsletter  using Constant Contact software.   George Connor, recently served as C&P  Chair and currently is BOD Secretary and  Parks and Safety Chair. George worked at  Sandia Labs as Manager of Sandia Benefits  Health Care Systems and Manager of  Computing Operations and Labs  Telecommunication Systems before retiring to  Sandia Heights.  Amanda Allen and Betsy Rodriquez, serve in  various capacities for C&P. Amanda  organizes the GRIT for publication [You may  have noticed the increase in graphics since she  became a staff member.]. Betsy has a wealth  of experience in her eight years with SHHA  and handles a lot of the drop-in requests for  information.   Communications and Publications is looking  for new members!

Instead give your key to a  trusted neighbor.   If someone comes to your door asking to use the telephone, make the call yourself. Do not let  them in!                     Install outdoor floodlights or motion-sensor lights to eliminate any areas where someone might  hide.   If someone in a vehicle asks for directions, answer from a distance. Do not approach the vehicle!    Prune shrubbery and trees so they do not obscure windows or doors. Plant thorny bushes or cacti  under your windows.   Sliding glass doors offer easy access if not properly secured. You can secure them by installing  commercially available locks or placing a broomstick or wooden dowel in the inside track to jam  the door.   Mark your valuables with your driver’s license number. Videotape the contents of your home.

Please be reminded that this is  the season when weeds begin to grow … like  weeds. While we all have differing opinions of  what constitutes good landscaping and how  much time we want to spend on our lots,  please look around your neighborhood and try  to be consistent. Spring is a good time to  consider if your house needs repainting,  windows need replacing, or your lot needs  cleaning.  Please remember that all plans for  construction or for any other changes that will  affect the exterior appearance of your  residence must receive prior approval from the  Architectural Control Committee (ACC).             Starting now on landscaping or house  maintenance may forestall your neighbors  filing a CSC complaint for something you  know needs to be done.            For most of us our homes are our  biggest investment and our property’s value,  in part, is determined by our neighborhood.  The mild spring weather is a perfect time to  start your landscape and home clean-up.  Your  neighbors and the CSC will appreciate it.     ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF  ACTIVE CSC VIOLATIONS:  Unit No.  Type of Violation  7  Vehicle/Equipment  Parking  7, 1  Home maintenance  4, 11  Dead or Prohibited Trees,  Dead Vegetation    2 Files Closed in the Past Month      ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞  A REFRESHER ON THE ACC’S  NEIGHBORHOOD REVIEW  PROCESS  Bob Bower, Chairman, Architectural  Control Committee (ACC)      It has been several years since I’ve  written an article on the ACC’s Neighborhood  Review (NR) process.  I feel it’s necessary to  periodically revisit this subject since use of the  NR is often an integral part of how the ACC  goes about its business of evaluating projects,  particularly very large ones, within the  community.    The SHHA covenants clearly place the  authority and responsibility to approve or  disapprove project applications with the ACC.   The covenants do not require the ACC to  conduct NRs prior to approval of any of its  projects. These reviews are conducted as a  courtesy to the community and are used  primarily for informing neighbors of a  proposed project in their immediate vicinity.  After the ACC arrives at the point where it has  determined that the project is in compliance  with applicable covenants, it is now ready to  consider the approval of the project.  The  decision to conduct a NR is made when the  ACC feels that the project may have an impact  on the views, harmony, property values, or  interests of the owners of nearby properties.    Once the ACC decides that a NR is  appropriate for a project, the following steps  occur:  1.  A notification letter is sent to neighbors in  the immediate vicinity of the proposed project.  The letter describes the project and advises  addressees that they have seven working days  to visit the SHHA office to review the project  plans and to respond in writing with relevant  comments.  These plans normally consist of a  plot plan showing the footprint of the project  on the property, a basic floor plan, and  elevation drawings.  Please note that if you  learn of an on-going NR of a project in your  neighborhood and feel that you should have     Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – April 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 4                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    received a notification letter and that you want to  review the project documents, call the SHHA  office and your request will be honored.  2.  Once all comments are received, the ACC will  provide feedback to the project applicant and will  work with the applicant to address the comments  that both the ACC and the applicant feel could  enhance the project from a neighborhood point of  view.  3.  If the ACC feels that the comments expressed  during the NR process indicate that there is a  general feeling of uneasiness within the  neighborhood concerning the project, the ACC  will schedule a meeting to allow neighbors to  meet with the ACC.  4.  Once the ACC has received all comments  from the NR and from any subsequent meetings  and discussions with concerned neighbors, the  ACC will consider all of these comments before  making a final decision.  Along with general  conditions stated in all ACC approval letters,  specific conditions stemming from relevant  neighborhood comments will be incorporated, as  appropriate, in the approval letter.    The NR process is the product of many  years of experience dealing with the community’s  need to continually build, update, and modify its  residences.  The ACC was established by the  covenants at their inception to provide overall  guidance to the property owners and to maintain  reasonable control of the various architectural  standards imposed by these covenants.  In the  beginning, there was no such “animal” as the NR  and it quickly became obvious that this sort of  review process was important in order to consider  the impact of a construction project from the  neighborhood’s point of view.  The ACC  continues to strongly endorse the value of the NR  as a key ingredient in its evaluation process and I  encourage all recipients of a NR notification  letter to take a few moments to review the  material available to you for your review and to  submit comments as appropriate.  Don’t miss this  opportunity and then regret that you did not take  the time to voice your concerns once the project  has been approved and is underway!    One final note:  For those of you who  submit applications to the ACC accompanied by  plans and drawings to be used for a NR, please do  not change anything contained in those plans and  drawings without first obtaining ACC approval  for those changes once the ACC has approved  those documents.  Neighbors who take the time to  review the documents have noted on several  recent occasions that what is being built does not  match what was reviewed during the NR process.   If a compromise can’t be reached with the ACC,  you, and any neighbors who register a complaint,  the burden will fall on you to remedy the  situation.  My best advice is to keep an eye on  what your contractor is doing and make sure that  the construction matches what was viewed by  your neighbors during the NR process and what  was subsequently approved by the ACC.

We meet bimonthly  in small groups in the homes of our members. Each small group is usually three couples plus a host  couple, with each couple contributing to some part of the dinner menu.  All couples and singles are  welcome.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance.   We’re always happy to have  new folks join us, so if this sounds like an activity that you might be interested in, please contact  Linda Mason at lindamason307@gmail.com or 505-554-2934.        “Your local band ALCHEMIE will be performing at the TIWA Lounge, Isleta Casino:  Friday  and Saturday nights, April 1-2, 10PM-1AM; ages 21+.
