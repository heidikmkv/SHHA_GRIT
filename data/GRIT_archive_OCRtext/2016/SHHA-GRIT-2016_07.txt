The President, Vice  President, and Chief of Security from Sandia Heights Services attended and  participated in the brief introduction and question and answer period.  Sheriff Dunlap, with over eighteen years’ experience on the force, stated that  the Sheriff’s Department maintains three shifts, with about ten deputies per  shift. He attends neighborhood meetings as needed. During the question and  answer period, one resident mentioned the use of  https://nextdoor.com/city/albuquerque--nm/ to report crime in the area, in  addition to using the site as a means of social interaction and events.  The meeting was adjourned at 7:40 pm. SHHA board members attending  commented that it would probably be advantageous to hold this event twice a  year.  BERNCO COMMISSION ADOPTS PEAK DINING AND SANDIA  PEAK SKI COMPANY INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS This release was sent to SHHA from BernCo (Bernalillo County)  Neighborhood Coordination: The Bernalillo County Commission, at its  Tuesday (May 24th) night meeting, approved an industrial revenue bond  package of up to $7 million for a new fine dining restaurant, bistro and bar on  behalf of Peak Dining LLC and of up to $2 million for Sandia Peak Ski  Company for the installation of a mountain coaster on behalf of Sandia Peak  Ski Company.  The proposed industrial revenue bond will be used for a total renovation of  what is now the High Finance Restaurant at the top of Sandia Peak and for  the installation of a mountain coaster within the existing ski area, a low-to-the- ground amusement ride.   “Tourists and locals alike will be able to enjoy a great new dining  experience and have a fun time at Bernalillo County’s newest year- round mountain entertainment destination,” says Bernalillo County  Commission Vice Chair Wayne Johnson.  “We look forward to the positive impact the new restaurant and  mountain coaster will create for our local tourism economy,” says  Bernalillo County Commissioner Lonnie Talbert.     There will be no fiscal obligation to the county resulting from the industrial  revenue bonds.  Peak Dining LLC and Sandia Peak Ski Company will invest  up to $9 million to complete these projects. These projects will result in the  creation of up to 114 new jobs and 73 construction jobs.  2   The GRIT – July 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 7       Walking and Cycling on the Tramway  Blvd. Bike Path  By Anne Manning, Communications and  Publications Committee Member  As summer progresses and the weather gets  warmer, more and more people, both pedestrians  and cyclists, will be on the Tramway bike path in  the early morning enjoying the sunrise and the  cool air. Recently, when I was out early for my  daily walk, I actually felt the need to warn a  woman who was walking towards me, that there  were cyclists coming up behind her.  If I had not  stopped, we would all have arrived at about the  same spot on the path at the same time –  definitely a recipe for disaster!  As I walk I try to be aware of what is going on  around me, either behind me and ahead of me,  but I can still be startled by a bike whizzing by me  on my left.  Cyclists, please call out, “On your left”  as you come upon a pedestrian.  And pedestrians  – please try to be aware of what is going on around you.  If you are walking a dog or dogs,  watch out for them too.  Remember, that as a  SHHA member, you can get an orange vest at  the Homeowners Association office for just $2.00.   See you on the path!  What's Cool in July  Before our annual rainy season starts, here are  some suggestions on cooling off:  Outpost Ice Arena, 9350 Tramway Blvd—in  Sandia Heights. Even if you just drop by to  enquire, this will take you away from the heat of  our blazing sun at this time of year. Depending on  what day of the week you choose, hours will vary.  Click on  http://www.outposticearena.com/icerental.html  or  call 856-7595 for more details. Broomball,  anyone?  The Tram, 30 Tramway Rd. As SHHA members,  we pay only $5 for a round-trip ticket, instead of  the retail $25 for adults (somewhat less for  seniors, children, and some others). Don’t forget  to bring $2 for grounds admission. Open daily  from 9 am to 9 pm. The Crest can be up to 30°  cooler than Albuquerque.  Parks--We have our own parks: W. L. Jackson  Park at 8600 Tramway Blvd NE, and Little Cloud  Park at 1850 San Bernardino Ave NE. For an  unusual experience visit Casa Grande Linear  Park, one tenth of a mile east of the intersection  of Tramway and Comanche. The park goes a  short distance north, or meanders further south to  Piedra Lisa Park at Menaul, just .2 mile east of  Tramway.   Linear Park Play Area  Pools—The closest public outdoor pool is  Eisenhower, 11001 Camero NE. Call 291-6292 or  visit  https://www.cabq.gov/parksandrecreation/recreati on/swimming/outdoor-pools/eisenhower-pool for  more information. Fees range from $2.25/adult to  25 cents for children 2 and under. Monthly and  seasonal fees are available. The closest indoor  pool is Los Altos, 10100 Lomas NE. Call 291- 6290 or visit  https://www.cabq.gov/parksandrecreation/recreati on/swimming/indoor-pools/los-altos-pool for  hours. No fees unless you want to participate in  water exercise classes.

These easements are  normally about seven or so feet in width. To  handle the runoff water during our rainy  season, many residences have storm  drains installed either by the County or by  the property owner, with County approval,  located within these easements which carry  water in channels along the road and, if  necessary, under existing walkways and  driveways that traverse the easements. In  some cases, these channels continue  under the road so the runoff water empties  into an arroyo or into another drainage  system to prevent flooding of residential  properties.   The County is responsible for inspecting  and cleaning these drains but simply does  not have the manpower to perform these  tasks on a regular basis. As a property  owner, if you observe that any of the drains  located on County easements or under  roads near your property are clogged with  dirt or other debris, you can place a call to  the County Road Maintenance at 848-1503  and they will inspect and clean out these  drains. Please keep in mind that the County  will not inspect and clean any drains that  are not within the existing easements.    4   The GRIT – July 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 7                                                                                                      BE BEAR AWARE    Sandia Heights Services kindly asks that if possible,  during the next few months, to please not place trash  bins out the night before your collection day.   Discarded food and other items can be hard for our  furry friends to resist and may attract animals seeking  food into the neighborhoods.  If possible, place your  bins out by 7am on your collection day to avoid  attracting bears and other wildlife                  SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop    Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash  and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

Now is the time.   But selecting what to do and when is difficult. So allow me to share a website created recently by a Los Alamos  scientist living in Santa Fe. It contains lots of very useful information. Here is the link: www.GoSolarNowNM.info. If  you have any solar questions, please email the scientist at contact@gosolarnownm.info.  Adding solar panels to your house makes sense financially: you will recoup more than the money invested. Each  month, your electric bill will be lower. Also, statistics show that, when houses have solar panels they sell 14% higher  on average. In addition the price of solar panels is going down, making any installation much cheaper now than a few  months ago.  If you are considering solar, I suggest that you go for it as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the 10% NM  tax credit which expires Dec. 31, 2016. Below is part of an email that provides important information. It is written by  “Positive Energy Solar” (Disclaimer: I never dealt with this institution and know nothing about it.)

We meet bimonthly in small groups in the homes of our members. Each small  group is usually three couples plus a host couple, with each couple contributing to some part of the dinner  menu.  All couples and singles are welcome.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance.  We’re always happy to have new folks join us, so if this sounds like an activity that you might be interested in,  please contact Linda Mason at lindamason307@gmail.com or 505-554-2934.  Mark your calendars for the Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour: Saturday and Sunday,  September 10 and 11, 10 am to 5 pm.  Once each year, the artists in the Sandia Heights community open their studios to present their work.   The tour began twelve years ago and has grown and added new artists to the group every year since.  Many of  the artists show their work in local galleries and others only participate in this one show each year.  Don’t miss this opportunity to meet your artistic neighbors and see an astounding display of oil  painting, acrylic painting, beaded jewelry, decorative gourds and baskets, watercolors, wood turning, ceramics  and pottery, yard art, silver jewelry, photography, glass, fabric wearable’s and accessories, mixed media pieces  and more.
