The new ordinance was sponsored by our District 4  County Commissioner, Lonnie Talbert.  It declares illegal street  racing or drag racing as a public nuisance that endangers the  community at large.  For a complete reading of the County’s news  release of January 7th on this ordinance, go to www.bernco.gov.   SHHA’s involvement in the drag racing issue stems from our  attendance at a meeting last September organized by John Betak,  president of the Alliance of Sandia Heights Neighborhoods.   Members of several homeowner associations in the immediate  vicinity of Tramway Boulevard also attended the meeting.  Many  of the attendees expressed concerns going back many years  regarding drag racing, particularly along the length of Tramway  Boulevard.  The Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office presented  briefings on the danger that drag racing presents throughout the  County and on the difficulty in apprehending those drivers  involved in drag racing activities due to a lack of an ordinance  designed specifically to target the offenders.  Commissioner  Talbert then proceeded to sponsor the creation of the ordinance  and SHHA participated in supporting its passage before the Board  of County Commissioners.  Hats off to Commissioner Talbert for a  job well done!      Each merchant participating in the Member Benefits  Program offers a discount to SHHA members.

TRAMWAY AND SNOW/ICE     By Cindy Mottle, Chairman, C&P    Bernalillo County takes pretty good care of  the Sandia Heights roads when compared to  other areas of Metro Albuquerque, but what  happened to Tramway on December 27th?  Since Tramway Boulevard is part of State’s  North Urban Patrol, and is a ‘Priority 2’ out  of three, clearing I-25 and I-40 took  precedence on that December Sunday.  Since the 2015-2016 El Nino (warming of  the Pacific Ocean) is now predicted to be  one of the most severe ever, Sandia Heights  residents can expect more precipitation as  this winter continues.   Those with online access can check weather  websites that constantly update their data,  information and predictions. Weather  Underground  [http://www.wunderground.com/] continues  to be helpful in this manner, particularly  because there are volunteers maintaining  nine Sandia Heights weather stations that are  reporting (uploading) temperatures,  precipitation, wind speed, humidity, etc.   WU maintains over 180,000 stations  throughout the lower 48 states, compared to  a little over 12,000 public stations used by  other weather reporting entities.          SNOW REMOVAL  Most of the roads  within Sandia Heights  are County  roads/streets. There are  a few private roads. The County is  responsible for removing snow from the  public roads. If you need maintenance on  your road/street, including snow removal,  please call the County at 848-1503    COMMUNICATIONS AND  PUBLICATIONS—  What does it do?    By Cindy Mottle, Chairman, C&P    A small change to Communications and  Publications’ (C&P) charter has been recently  approved, which makes this a good time to  read about what the Committee is all about:    Publishing a newsletter a minimum of  6 times per year. Today we publish  monthly, but we will gradually begin to  consider publishing every other month  effective 2017. Between expenses  (currently about $8650 annually) and lack  of articles, we are looking at better ways  to communicate with SHHA residents.    Assuring that the website remains up  to date. If you spot any dead or outdated  links, contact the SHHA office.    Assisting with the office computers and  communications devices. The SHHA  website also provides a database so that  Amanda and Betsy can pull up accurate  information when residents visit, email,  or write the office.    Publishing the Annual Membership  Directory including residents' guide.  The directory is available to members on  the SHHA website. Members need to  login to the SHHA website in order to be  able to access the directory. Contact the  SHHA office if you have any trouble  logging on to your account or if you have  any questions. You should have received  your 2016 copy by now.    Obtaining advertising for all  publications. We have a very loyal group  of advertisers, but are interested in any  company that will provide a service to  SHHA residents and the surrounding  area.    Assisting with other communications  as may be needed. When residents have  communications questions or ideas, they  can contact the office by phone, email, or  a visit.      4   The GRIT – February 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 2                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash  and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

Residents are  advised not leave mail in mailboxes, either incoming or outgoing. If you cannot  retrieve your mail promptly ask a trusted neighbor to get it for you. If you are  leaving town suspend your mail delivery - have it held at the Post Office.  If you have mail that would be considered sensitive, you may want to mail it at a USPS office.  Another suggestion might be to replace your mailbox with either a heavy duty locking type or  totally enclosing the box with acceptable construction and a lock to impede vandals as well as  thieves.  Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle checking mailboxes. A license number on a vehicle along  with a vehicle description would go a long way to putting an end to this activity.   If you experience mail theft, notify the BernCo. Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) (798-7000), the USPS  inspector (1-877-876-2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856-6347 and 263-4654). If you  witness a crime in progress notify BCSO and Security.    Judson McCollum Executive Broker 10 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-3717 JudsonABQ@aol.com Sharon McCollum Executive Broker 15 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-6217 SMMinABQ@aol.com Selling Sandia Heights Homes!

The  CSC’s process includes investigating  suspected violations and ensuring  compliance if appropriate, which can  entail multiple site visits, photographs, and  letters. This process, including time for  corrective action, may take weeks or  months.  The file will remain active during  this process. Once it has been completed  you will receive a letter stating that we  have closed the file.    The following is a summary of active  CSC violations:  Unit No.  Type of Violation  7  Vehicle/Equipment  Parking  7, 1  Home maintenance  4, 11  Dead or Prohibited Trees,  Dead Vegetation  2 Files Closed in the Past Month   Responding to Home  Emergency Situations  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC  NOTE:  This article is published  frequently and is mainly for the benefit of  our newcomers since they may not  understand what needs to be done  regarding ACC involvement when a home  emergency occurs.  Hope the information  is useful!  As a homeowner, as many of you  well know emergency situations involving  your home can occur from time to time.  If  you happen to encounter a situation such  as a broken or clogged water or sewer line,  repair or replacement of your septic  system, a leaky roof, stucco damage  (particularly at the parapet locations), a  large tree or tree branch that may pose a  danger to your property if not trimmed or  removed, or any other situation where the  urgency of the issue requires quick action  on your part in order to prevent or  minimize property damage, the ACC does  not want to stand in your way.  You do not  need to submit an ACC application form  for these types of situations.  Just let the  SHHA office know that you will be  tending to an emergency situation and, if  applicable, heavy equipment may be  needed to fix the problem. The phone  number at the SHHA office is 797-7793.   This information will help the office  answer questions from your neighbors  who may be inquiring about what is going  on at your residence.   Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – February 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 2 Continued from page 7  Just as a reminder, be careful when selecting  a contractor to handle an emergency repair or  for any other repairs or modifications to your  residence. There are many individuals  looking for business and some of these folks  may not be properly licensed or insured. You  bear the risk of poor quality workmanship  and a host of other problems if you choose to  use an unlicensed or uninsured contractor.  I  have included articles in the GRIT on this  subject over the past several years so take  some time and familiarize yourself with just  how to make sure that your contractor is  properly licensed and insured before you  “sign on the dotted line”.  Don’t be a victim  of an unlicensed or uninsured contractor!  Once your emergency issue has been  solved and you wish to pursue a permanent  fix to minimize or prevent the recurrence of  that particular issue, you would then be  required to submit an application to the ACC.   Examples of this would include replacing  your entire roof, restuccoing your residence,  or replacing a large tree that was removed.   Keep in mind that trees which will exceed the  height of your roofline when they reach full  maturity are not authorized since they can  interfere with the views of neighboring  properties.  Also, The ACC does not need an  application for replacement or repair of your  septic system.  Wastewater systems are  handled by the County’s Public Works  Department and they will issue the proper  permits and perform the proper inspections to  ensure that the septic system meets County  requirements.  From all of the members of the ACC,  we wish you an “emergency-free” 2016 and  please remember that the Committee is here   to help you in any way we can through all  phases of your home improvement projects.

Saint Valentine's Day, commonly known as Valentine's Day, or the Feast of Saint  Valentine, is observed on February 14 each year. St. Valentine's Day began as a liturgical  celebration of one or more early Christian saints named Valentinus. The most popular  martyrology associated with Saint Valentine was that he was imprisoned for performing  weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry, and for ministering to Christians, who  were persecuted under the Roman Empire; during his imprisonment, he is said to have  healed the daughter of his jailer Asterius and before his execution, according to the  legendary account, he wrote, "from your Valentine" as a farewell to her. The day's  association with romantic love grew in the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the High Middle  Ages, when the tradition of courtly love flourished. By the 15th century, it had evolved into  an occasion in which lovers expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers,  offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards.  Community Event Bulletin Board  Not all of these groups are sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed  St. Chads: Ashes On The Run: Jog by on Ash Wednesday, February 10th, for Ashes On  the Run! We will be on the bike path at San Rafael and Tramway to greet the runners and  walkers, and offering prayers and the imposition of ashes to those who would like them.
