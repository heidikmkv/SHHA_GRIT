The policy can be found in  the SHHA Rules and  Regulations for the  Association under the  Board tab.  c   August 2016 Vol. 32 – No. 8 Emergency and Non-Emergency  Upgrades To Your Residence  By Bob Bower, Chairman, Architectural Control  Committee (ACC)  Let’s discuss emergency situations at your home that  may require your immediate attention.  If your roof or  some windows suddenly develop leaks, go ahead  and get these items repaired to prevent further damage to your home. The ACC  considers these types of situations to constitute a valid emergency and, as such,  they do not require an ACC application in order to commence work.  If, however,  you eventually want to replace your windows or the entire roof, you will need to  submit ACC applications for these projects and obtain ACC approval prior to the  start of these non-emergency upgrades.  In other emergency situations such as  the repair of broken or clogged water or sewer lines, repair or replacement of a  septic system or of some of its components, or other situations where the  urgency of the situation requires quick action in order to minimize property  damage and inconvenience to you as the homeowner, the ACC does not want to  stand in your way.  If a situation like this arises, just let the SHHA office know  (call 797-7793) that you will be tending to an emergency situation and, if  applicable, that heavy equipment for excavations may be required.  This  information will help the office answer questions from your neighbors who may be  inquiring about what is going on at your residence.  Just as a reminder, you are required by your Unit covenants to submit an  application to the ACC for any project that changes the external appearance of  your residence.  Recently, the SHHA office staff has received calls and emails  from residents stating that they are proceeding to replace a roof with the same  type that already exists on the home or to restucco the home with the same  colors that are currently on the home since they feel that these changes don’t  constitute a change to the external appearance of the residence. The ACC  disagrees with this and considers reroofing and restuccoing to constitute external  changes and, as such, these activities need prior ACC approval even if the  roofing material and stucco colors match what’s already on the home. Some  other examples of projects requiring ACC approval before work commences  (along with reroofing or restuccoing) are the addition of a new room or garage  bay, installation of solar panels, replacement of doors or windows, and  landscaping (walls, fences, patios, plants, etc.).  Correcting after-the-fact  changes to your property causes aggravation and can be expensive if the ACC  does not give its approval of some or all of your project.  Save yourself the hassle  of this kind of situation by applying to the ACC for approval before you undertake  a project unless, or course, you encounter an emergency situation.  The ACC  handles about 30 projects a month but even with this heavy workload, the ACC  tries to approve all projects within no more than 30 days depending on the  complexity of the project, and in many cases within just a few days.  The ACC is  here to help you so please take advantage of our expertise—we are absolutely  willing to work with you to make your projects (emergency and non-emergency)  as pleasant as possible.  2   The GRIT – August 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 8                                                                                                    Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office  Reporting Scams    SHHA has recently been receiving BCSO posts from  various sources. A call to their office confirmed that  scammers are posting on websites and calling  residents, posing as real BCSO employees. If you note  these posts, or feel that you have received calls about  outstanding warrants or requests for money, please call  798-7000 to report the scam.  SHHA wants you to  know that any article or any SHHA website posting  has been fact checked and verified.    Home Security When Traveling        It’s great to get away on vacation, but take the time to  check off these tips before leaving:    Two weeks before: Check your insurance to make sure  it is up to date and covers your current property.   Notify your credit card companies when and where  you will be traveling. Arrange for Sandia Heights  Security to check your property.  Ask a friend to stop by, pick up flyers on the doorstep,  take out and bring in your trash/recycle bins, just to  make your place look lived in. Ask a friend or  neighbor to hold a house key, travel itinerary, and  emergency phone numbers. (They can send you  updates via email if you check in from on the road.)   If you will be gone for more than a week, consider  arranging for yard care while you are away.  One week before: Stop delivery of newspapers and  mail. Set some lights and music or TV on a timer.  Day before: Check that all doors and windows are  securely locked (including any outbuildings).   Don’t close all your blinds. Try to keep an everyday  appearance. Turn your thermostats: cool to 84° or heat  to 55°, and check faucets, toilets to make sure they are  completely off. Turn down water heater to ‘vacation’  mode or 100°. Keep your house well lighted using  timers, but don’t change it significantly from when  you are at home. Empty your refrigerator of  perishables.   Store valuables (jewelry, computers, financial papers)  in a safe place. Identity Theft is on the rise, and can be  much more costly than the loss of objects. Don’t forget  that little doggie door! Physically lock the garage door  to thwart criminals with scanning door openers.   While traveling: Check your phone messages on a  regular basis. DO NOT have your phone message  recorder state that you are away.    Parks and Safety Committee  By George Connor,   (A repeat of a 2014 GRIT article with facts and contact  numbers checked)  SHHA residents might in the future encounter the  situation of a mortgage company refusing to make a  loan on a home in Sandia Heights that has previously  been mortgaged without the owner purchasing  National Flood Insurance.    Root Cause:  Most mortgage companies hire third   party companies to provide them with floodplain  determinations, and these companies can make an  occasional mistake because of the specific requirement  for having flood insurance. The specifics that require  flood insurance are if your structure is in the  floodplain, not if your lot is partially in a floodplain.  That means the third party companies have to be very  precise and they may not always be that precise. Since  1983, BC ordinances require that all structures built in  the county/ city be built outside the floodplain as part  of the National Floodplain Insurance Program.   Any  home built since 1983 is by definition not in a  floodplain.  Possible Solution: Most mortgage companies will  allow an applicant one appeal.  Bernalillo County  Floodplain administrator Don Briggs suggested that  you notify the mortgage company that you will be  appealing. Gather material together, then call and go  visit Don who will help you construct the appeals  submission.   Contact information for the BC Floodplain  administrator is: Mr. Don Briggs; Telephone   848-1511; 2400 South Broadway SE, ABQ 87102;  drbriggs@bernco.gov.      try to see snakes as friendly. If you can’t bring  yourself to like snakes, at least leave them alone and  think about how many more mice would be trying  to get into your house without them.  Understandably, you may not want a rattlesnake  taking up residence outside your back door. If this  happens to you, please call Animal Control at  314-0280.   Rattlesnakes and bull snakes will be the only two  mentioned in this article, because bull snakes are  most often mistaken for rattlesnakes. Rattlesnakes  and bull snakes have similar coloring, with black  and brown markings on their backs. This is no  accident. Bull snakes try very hard to look and act  like rattlesnakes. When threatened, they may coil  and raise their heads, hiss, and rustle their tails in  dry leaves to mimic a rattle. However, they are  nonvenomous constrictors that kill their prey by  squeezing, and they pose no threat to humans or  pets. One foolproof distinction is the shape of the  pupils of the eyes (rattlesnakes have vertical,  football-shaped pupils and bull snakes have round  pupils), but most people don’t want to get anywhere  near close enough to tell the difference that way!  The easiest way to tell the difference is to look at  the head: a rattlesnake has a distinctly triangular  head with pronounced eye ridges and a neck that is  narrower than the head, while a bull snake’s head is  roughly cylindrical and the same diameter as its  neck. The other obvious difference is the body  shape. Rattlesnakes are larger in diameter relative  to their length and are fattest in the middle of the  body, with a blunt tail ending in several rattles in    The GRIT –August 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 8        Snakes and You  By Dave Mottle, Parks and Safety, with thanks  to Kate Fry  Even in mid-summer, snakes still need to sun  themselves, and forage for food.  SNAKES?   Sandia Heights residents have mixed feelings about  snakes—some people like them and some people  don’t. So by speaking in defense of snakes, it is  hoped that folks will see snakes in a different light.  Humans seem to be hard-wired to be afraid of  snakes, even if they have never seen a snake. Living  in Sandia Heights, we share habitat with several  kinds of snakes, the most common of which are bull  snakes (also called gopher snakes) and rattlesnakes.  Only the rattlesnake is venomous, but all snakes are  vital to controlling the rodent population. So please  adult snakes. Bull snakes are more or less the same  diameter the entire length of their body. A five-foot- long rattlesnake may be three or four inches in  diameter in the middle of its body, while a five- foot-long bull snake is probably about an inch and a  half in diameter. These photos show the differences  very clearly:  Bull snake (gopher snake), Pituophis catenifer  (photo by Colorado State University)  Western diamondback rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox  (photo by Arizona Sonora Desert Museum)  Both bull snakes and rattlesnakes are shy and will  try to avoid people. They usually know you’re  approaching from the ground vibration, and given  the chance they will usually crawl away. They  won’t chase you! If you see a snake, it’s probably  stretched out on the pavement or on a sunny trail  catching rays. Snakes are reptiles, and the only way  they can regulate their body temperature is by  moving to a warm area (like sun-warmed asphalt) to  get warm and to a cool area (under a tree or in the  shade of a rock) to cool off.

Unfortunately, some people go out of their way to  run over snakes. Please don’t let this be you! If you  see a snake basking on the road, try to drive around  it. If you encounter a snake while walking on the  trail (or on the road, for that matter), you can jump  up and down or stomp your feet to create  vibrations that the snake will feel. Then just wait  until the snake moves away. But if a rattlesnake  responds by coiling and rattling, it’s best to take a  detour! In other words, “Never put your hands or  feet any place you can’t see”. If you follow this  advice, you won’t step on a rattlesnake and you  won’t get bitten.  In the unlikely event you are bitten, don’t panic!  Call 911 and keep the bite area lower than your  heart to slow the spread of venom. Snakebite kits  are useless and may even make things worse.  Rattlesnake venom is a potent toxin that kills  nerves and tissue, so the best thing you can do is to  get to a hospital as quickly as possible where you  can get antivenin. Dogs sometimes get bitten  because they are curious and will put their face  right up to a snake to see what it is. If this happens,  get the dog to the veterinarian as fast as you can.  It’s another good reason to keep dogs on a leash  when you walk them on the streets or on trails. If  you see a snake near your house, please leave it  alone. You’ll probably never see it again. Rest  assured it will gobble up mice and other rodents  and keep the population under control. There’s  never a good reason to kill a snake—they are an  essential part of our wildlife habitat.    THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF  ACTIVE CSC VIOLATIONS:  Unit No.  Type of Violation  6, 8, 15, 26  Home Maintenance  5, 6, 18  Home Maintenance. No  Prior ACC Approval  4, 5, 9  Lighting  5  RV Parking  21  Trash Bins    8 Files Closed Since the Last GRIT  LIGHT POLLUTION    Most of the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants  address light pollution. This is done to preserve the  enjoyment of the night sky from light pollution.  Regardless of the individual covenants for your  Unit, the entire North Albuquerque Acres and  Sandia Heights fall under the Bernalillo County  Code for light pollution. The code includes, but is  not restricted to security lighting, street lights,  landscape lights, building mounted area lights,  building façade lights. In general, lights shall  remain OFF between 11:00 pm and sunrise; lights  on buildings shall be mounted no higher than 16  feet; lights must be shielded so the light is directed  perpendicular to the ground.  To see the entire code  and for exceptions, go to the Bernalillo County  Website (www.bernco.gov) and look under  ordinances, Section 30-186.     The CSC get many complaints each year.  These  fall into:  1. Unshielded flood lights (typical covenant  violation).  The Code defines direction of a  floodlight pointing - generally downward.    2. Lights left on through the night.  These  sometimes come from incorrect timer or motion  detector settings.    3. Light fixtures, such as globes, clear garage and  door fixtures, bare bulbs, etc.  These may look  stylish but when left on they are visible a long way  off.  So, if you leave your lights on at the entry, garage  doors, or flood lights, after 11:00pm and they are  not shielded they may be in violation of the County  Code. While the CSC does not enforce County  ordinances we will work with folks to make them  aware of the options and try to get resolution. At  night, even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to enjoy the  night sky, the darkness of the neighborhood, or the  lights of the city below.      Please take the time to check your exterior lighting  and shutoff devices to be sure that your neighbors  won't have to file a complaint.              8   The GRIT – August 2016 – Volume 32 – No. 8  SHHA MEMBER BENEFITS:  Check out the entire SHHA Member Benefits  Program at www.sandiahomeowners.org and  enjoy discounts at our supporting local  merchants.
