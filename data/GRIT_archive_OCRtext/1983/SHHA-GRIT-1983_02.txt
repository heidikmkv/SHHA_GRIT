SANDIA RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIA':rION THANKS YOU - SANDIA HEIGHTS RESIDEN"r.S! !  ~ife all deserve a hearty "~\fell done!" for the support mustered in  opposing the granting of a liquor license on Tramway Lane to  County Line of Albuquerque.  The location for this license and establishment was denied by  l'ilr. Ti to Chavez, the County Hearing Officer, after a formal hearing  on February 4, 198J, which 130 of us, braving a driving snow storm  to get there, attended.  we knew we had the facts and figures to  support our contention that the establishment of this bar/restaurant  on Tramway Lane would be detrimental to the safety and health of  the nearby residents.  Our attorney, lVir. NicCullough, did a superb  job in organizing and presenting our case.  Some of us homeowners may not realize that we are all voting members  of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, although not voluntary  dues-paying members.  The Association represents all residents.  A strong and active neighborhood association can have a tremendous  positive impact on our environment.  Therefore, please plan to attend on this Saturday, February 26, 1983  at 10: JO A.fo., the meeting of the Sandia Heights HomeoV'mers  Association at the Firehouse; and, have something to say about  your future in Sandia Heights.  21 February 1983  Sincerely,  ~/t,J~  Randall v1/illiams, Chairman  Sandia Residential Association
