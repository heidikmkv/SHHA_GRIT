Procedures for Property Owners   to Amend Their Unit Covenants    Sandia Heights operates under 38 sets of unit covenants. Most of these  were written in the 1960s and ’70s; some restrictions have become obso- lete while new ones may be needed to deal with things unknown back  then. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) cannot modify  or change any unit covenants. Any covenant changes or modifications can  only be done by the property owners within their individual unit. SHHA rec- ognizes the right of property owners to amend the covenants of their units  in accordance with procedures set forth in the covenants of each unit.  SHHA has developed information to facilitate that process and to ensure  that a proposed amendment is in agreement with established covenants.  To avoid potential conflicts with the existing covenants, we suggest that  the proposed amendment(s) be shown to the SHHA Board of Directors for  review prior to initiating a petition signature effort within the unit.   The information and steps to initiate a covenant amendment are availa- ble on the home page of the SHHA website or the following link:  https://Procedures for Property Owners to Amend Unit Covenants.pdf.  You can also get a copy from the SHHA office.    Farewell to Jennifer    Jennifer Craft, the SHHA office administrator, is leaving Albuquerque  and her position with SHHA. She has been in the office for a year and a half  during very trying times. We sincerely thank her for her service to the com- munity and always-smiling presence in the office, and wish her well in her  new endeavors.   2   The GRIT – June 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 6  A conversation with Antonio Jaramillo,  Dept Head of Bernalillo County   Operations and Maintenance  By Joe Boyce, Parks & Safety Committee Chair    Background: On April 16, I had a good phone conversa- tion with Antonio about SHHA traffic calming and  other issues. His department is responsible for four ma- jor areas: roads, traffic engineering, drainage, and solid  waste. Antonio has a civil engineering education, with  stints at NMDOT, and about 2.5 years at Bernalillo  County (BC). His email is aejaramillo@bernco.gov, of- fice phone is 505-848-1548. Many thanks for his time.  Here are my paraphrased notes:  What are the biggest issues you face?  Depending on  the area, the “demand” can vary considerably. For in- stance, rural areas may be more concerned with trash  dumping and solid-waste disposal, along with roads.  Urban areas may have more inquiries about traffic, pot- holes, or storm drainage. Coordinating the mainte- nance and keeping a balance of service for everyone  involved is always a good challenge.  How do we get drivers to slow down?  We call it “traf- fic calming.” Again, it depends on the situation. We  have to balance factors like emergency vehicle access,  safety benefits, community input, drainage, and road- way design. It’s not just a matter of putting up speed  bumps. If a request is made for an area with speed con- cerns, we first do a speed study, which measures traffic  volume, speeds, and other factors. We then determine  the feasibility of a bump, street modifications  (curbs/gutters or narrowing), pedestrian issues, or  other ways of calming traffic. The AASHTO (American  Association of State Highway and Transportation Offi- cials) is the regulatory/guideline body that has the de- sign aspects that need to be considered. (JB Note: their  web site isn’t easy to browse or find info. It’s for the  professional society.) BC works with Albuquerque City  and NMDOT (New Mexico Department of Transporta- tion) to determine who is responsible for a particular  location (e.g., Tramway is NMDOT, Sandia Heights is  mostly BC.)  So, what is the best way to get something done?  First,  individuals should call the county contact center (505- 848-1503), which starts a work order and department  investigation. Calling the County Commissioner (Walt  Benson for our District 4) is also a method some use to  get action. Once the study is complete, if the 85th per- centile speeds are 10 mph over the posted speed limit,  then a petition needs to be signed by ~75% of the local  residents. A champion from the community is usually  asked to circulate the petition to get the 75% compli- ance. Budget and other concerns will also need to be  addressed. Stop signs require additional considera- tions such as north/south flow priority, emergency ac- cess, etc. If it is a generic or non-specific issue involving  the whole area, it’s often best to consolidate the re- quest/issue with one person like the chair of the rele- vant SHHA committee.   Who owns the side of the road? It is important to  know that while BC owns a right of way or easement  alongside the county roads and will help with mowing  and clearance when requested, it is the homeowner’s  responsibility to make sure they are obeying the “set  back” ordinance regarding sight obstructions. This in- cludes roadside drainage, sidewalk maintenance,  trees, yard foliage, and artwork. Each owner should in- spect the sightlines alongside their lot from the road  and make sure to cut back any obstructions to help im- prove pedestrian safety.  What about highlighting the speed limit signs or a ra- dar speed sign?  The county has a trailer that shows the  speed someone is traveling and flashes at speeders.  That can be used, but it’s fairly large and would require  homeowners or others to provide space so it could be  used safely. (JB note: we have an ongoing trial with  one on San Rafael Ave). It needs to be moved every so  often to be effective as well. Lights that highlight a  sign—like the ones on the stop sign at Tramway near  the County Line BBQ—surprisingly get pushback from  some who don’t like the lights and complain about  them. They do work to keep folks from “blowing”  through the sign, however.

What's it like to be a balloon- ist? How does it all work?  All I’ve ever known about hot air balloons came from  the 1956 movie Around the World in 80 Days until re- cently, when I met Sandia Heights balloonists Diana  Schroen and Tom Fisher. They not only have answered  my questions, but also have invited me along to see  their crew in action, to become part of their crew, and  to come along for the ride. Here are some of my impres- sions.  Tom says it well, “Why would a person get up at the  crack of dawn, assemble the aircraft and soar through  the air with no steering while attached to a bag of hot  air and land with no wheels...? It's the feeling of being  free as a bird.” On a recent Saturday morning I saw how  that freedom comes at the expense of a lot of training  and effort.  Each flight’s preparations start a couple days prior as  Tom checks the weather forecast. He and Diana look at  several weather apps to get a full picture of conditions.  He looks for clear weather and low wind speeds; for our  flight the forecast was for winds out of the SE at three  mph. Even so, on our drive to the launch location Diana  and Tom looked for signs of what the wind was—or  wasn’t—doing: the steam from the industrial plant was  rising straight up; the flags we passed were barely mov- ing. On arrival at the launch site, he released a “pibal”  (pilot balloon) to see where the wind would take it, and  we watched how the balloons ascending ahead of us  were moving.  The morning I flew with “Breezy Rider” was gor- geous; the vacant lot was jammed with trucks, people,  and balloons. As we waited our turn, I saw how neigh- borly good manners and patience go a long way to- wards making a fun experience for everyone. Members  of the crew were friendly and generous to welcome in  and educate a total outsider to that world, pointed out  and explained the steps to setting up and launching,  and showed me what I could do to help.  It takes several people to manhandle the basket, fan,  burner, and envelope out of the truck and into position.  Each person has to know how to handle the envelope  carefully, has to listen and be quick to follow the crew  chief’s directions, stay out of the way, or step in as  needed. They’ve got to be alert and work well together;  the safety of each person and proper care of the equip- ment are vital from the ground up, so to speak. And  then they do it all over again after the flight, in reverse.  Once in the air, I was struck by how important situa- tional awareness is for the pilot; he can’t just lean back  in the basket and enjoy the view. He's constantly alert  to altitude, the temperature inside the balloon enve- lope, wind direction, ground speed, what's below and  above and beside and before him. I had to pay atten- tion, too, to his instruction and to what I saw below us  or on my side of the basket.  That huge envelope of hot air I looked up into carried  us, light and effortless—except for the pilot’s constant  anticipating, adjusting, and responding to conditions  and surroundings. The physics of wind and temperature  truly determine where and how a balloon travels. The  pilot can raise or lower the balloon, more or less rapidly,  to catch the wind, but can't steer it to the right or left.  And unlike those free-flying birds, a balloon doesn’t re- spond instantly to its pilot’s adjustments.  The flight wasn’t as quiet as I expected; propane  burners make noise. I could even hear the burners of  other balloons a block away. The dogs below us cer- tainly didn’t like the ultrasonic frequencies of the burn- ers. Tom and Diana told me how they need to be aware  and considerate of cattle, horses, chickens, llamas, etc.  down below which can be violently disturbed by sound  frequencies we can’t hear.  Our flight was short due to the stillness and warmth  of the morning, and our landing was close enough for  the crew to arrive before we even touched down.  Thanks to Tom’s experience, knowledge of the prevail- ing wind, and a ready crew, we came in smoothly over a  barbed-wire-topped fence, and I barely felt the bump as  we landed on the dirt road. The group all had stories  about hard landings which made me glad my first one  was so gentle.  Getting up close to the whole process of a single  flight has whetted my appetite for more.

It is hopeful that it will be an in-person tour with 36 artists displaying their work at various  homes around the Heights. Once again, a variety of media will be on display from paintings to ceramics, to jewelry,  and several other media. SAVE THE DATES!!    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per directions  of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of every other  month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6– 8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee) as the year  progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of  the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance.  Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a September kick-off,  and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with 15 interested couples  from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter  at (505) 330-1518.
