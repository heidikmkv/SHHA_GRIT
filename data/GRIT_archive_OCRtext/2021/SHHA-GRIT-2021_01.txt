SHHA 2021 Annual Meeting is February 20    The Annual Meeting of the Association membership is February 20, 9:00– 10:30 AM. This will be a virtual meeting held via the Zoom app. You will need  to register early in order to receive the link to the meeting. Please register  no later than close of business, Friday, February 12. (This is a change from  the date stated last month.) If you need help with using Zoom, there will  be a practice session February 16, 10:00 AM. Let the staff know you want to  practice at the time you register. The agenda will be in next month’s GRIT.    Seeking People Interested in Helping Their HOA    Serving on the SHHA Board of Directors is a positive way to give back to  our great community. All qualified applicants will be evaluated. Simply fill  out a Statement of Interest which you can find on the website and return  it to the office. We’ll take it from there.            2   The GRIT – January 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 1  Notes on CSC Enforcement Policies  By Bob Thomas, CSC Chair    All covenant complaints must be filed with the Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) office. The  complainant must be a Sandia Heights homeowner,  must be a member of SHHA, and the suspected viola- tion must be in their Unit, an adjacent Unit, or in the  line of sight of the complainant’s Unit. The Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) does not patrol looking for  violations. Unit covenants are not selectively enforced.  All suspected violations filed with the SHHA office are  evaluated on their own merits with the goal of con- sistency in enforcement.   Once logged in with the SHHA office, the complaint  is assigned to a CSC member to assess its validity,  which is based upon the wording in the specific Unit’s  covenants. The CSC investigator visits the property of  the suspected violation, takes photos, and often con- fers with the complainant if clarification is required.  The CSC investigator does not trespass on the sus- pected violator’s property to assess validity.  Often the complaint has no validity because the sus- pected violation is not covered by the particular Unit  covenants. Unfortunately, this occurs quite often. In  some of the original Units the covenants do not cover  issues that have lately popped up with new technol- ogy, such as LED outdoor lighting, maturing elm trees  that were not a problem in the 1960s, and work trucks  and storage trailers that are parked in driveways and  front yards. Most Unit covenants have outdated arti- cles that need to be updated to modern times. Alt- hough the CSC has legal authority to enforce your Unit  covenants as they are written, it has no legal authority  to change the covenants. The homeowners in a partic- ular Unit own the covenants and only these homeown- ers can update the covenants. This is difficult, but not  impossible, to do and some Units have done so in the  past couple of years. There is detailed information on  the SHHA webpage on how to change your covenants.  If the complaint is judged to be valid, then the CSC  policy is to notify the violator and to always seek a sat- isfactory resolution between the complainant and vio- lator. Often the homeowner is unaware of a violation  and, thankfully, most residents in Sandia Height are  willing to work to solve the violation. Very rarely is  there a problem that cannot be solved amicably, and  very rarely has the CSC had to refer violations to the  SHHA attorney for legal action.  It is worth noting that in some situations the Berna- lillo County Ordinances are more restrictive that the  SHHA covenants. For complaints concerning sus- pected violations covered by County ordinances—such  as light pollution, animal control, traffic, noise enforce- ment, etc.—the complainant is advised to contact the  appropriate County agency as these are beyond the  CSC’s ability to monitor and control. The CSC has a  good working relationship with Bernalillo County Plan- ning and Zoning.  It must be noted that some of the language in many  of the Unit covenants is quite subjective and may be in- defensible in court. For these complaints and this sub- jective language, the SHHA attorneys over the years  have strongly advised against pursuing a court judge- ment. An example, which is found in most Sandia  Heights covenants, is the article which states “No trade  or offensive activity of any kind shall be carried on upon  any residential lot, nor shall anything be done on any  lot which shall constitute an annoyance or nuisance to  the neighborhood.” What is offensive, what is annoy- ance and nuisance? The CSC does not act on this com- plaint. The SHHA attorney is consulted for how to  move forward in a legal sense for all covenant lan- guage that is subjective and questionable, i.e., that falls  in a “gray area” for interpretation. This is a challenge  for the CSC members.      3   The GRIT – January 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 1    Let’s Talk About Landscape Plans  Bob Bower, ACC Chair & Emily B. Rudin, ACC Member    Landscape plans involve trees, shrubs, vines, grasses,  and groundcovers, and their associated irrigation. But  did you know that landscape designs also include walls,  gates, driveways, fences, courtyards, patios, pathways,  lighting, awnings, play equipment, grading and drain- age, hornos, hot tubs, water features, outdoor kitch- ens, trellises and pergolas, fire pits, flagpoles, sculpture,  boulders, bark mulch, and various gravel mulches?  If you’re thinking about adding any of these elements  to your property, it’s important to remember that you  must first apply for approval to the Architectural Con- trol Committee (ACC) before any installation. And this is  true whether or not your modifications are visible to any  neighbors in Sandia Heights!  Your landscape is a major part of your property and  directly affects your home’s value as well as your enjoy- ment of it. As you begin planning, you’ll want to become  acquainted with your Unit covenants. SHHA has nearly  40 Unit covenants—each Unit has their own. They  clearly state that the ACC has the responsibility for re- viewing and approving changes to the exterior appear- ance of all properties within Sandia Heights. Many of  the ACC’s applications pertain to house exteriors, but  landscaping—as defined by the list above—is of equal  importance and is within the ACC’s purview. As such,  the ACC strongly encourages homeowners to submit  landscape plans concurrently with any designs they  might be applying for with respect to exterior altera- tions to their houses. Depending on the complexity of  your landscape design, you might wish to submit a pre- liminary plan to the ACC for review and feedback.  In addition to your Unit covenants, your landscape  design is governed by two ACC documents that set  standards for landscape planning throughout the com- munity. First, after reviewing and approving a home- owner’s application, the ACC sends an approval letter to  the applicant with a list of conditions which are binding  on the property owner for the duration of the approved  project. One of the conditions specifically addresses  landscaping, and states that all landscaping changes  must be approved by the ACC prior to the implementa- tion of those changes. The condition also includes a  timeline within which these changes must be com- pleted.  The second ACC document is a comprehensive land- scaping guideline, developed and refined over many  years by ACC members with extensive experience in  landscape architecture and design. This valuable docu- ment, the ACC Design Guideline for Landscaping, is avail- able on SHHA’s website under the ACC menu. It is in- tended to be used by all Sandia Heights property own- ers for planning and installing their landscape features.  It has many recommendations from local landscaping  experts and is tailored to our community’s specific con- ditions, such as climate zone, topography, and soil type.  In its introduction, the Guideline states that it was estab- lished to ensure that the installation of landscaping is in  compliance with the covenants, blends with its sur- roundings, uses water-conserving materials and plant  and tree species, and is courteous to the neighborhood  by refraining from plantings that are prohibited by  SHHA and/or Bernalillo County because of height at ma- turity, water needs, seed or pollen dispersal, or other at- tributes. The ACC relies heavily on the Guideline in its de- cisions to approve or disapprove landscaping plans for  new construction or upgrades of existing landscaping.  The ACC hopes that this article will help alleviate any  confusion or misunderstanding on how landscape plans  play a major role in the overall appearance and value of  your property. Please read the entire letter that the ACC  sends to you once your project is approved, comply  with its binding conditions and with your Unit cove- nants, and use the Guideline to assist you with your land- scaping needs.

Here are some procedures for those who haven’t used  this application before. There will be a practice session  four days before the meeting where you can try out  these procedures with your desktop or laptop com- puter, tablet, or smart phone.  1. Click on the meeting invitation URL that the host  (SHHA, in our case) shared via email.  2. Open the Zoom app. It often opens automatically.  3. Approve the request for permission to use your com- puter’s audio and camera.  For the Annual Meeting, you may need to wait for the  host to arrive first, and you will be placed into a “wait- ing room” that the host controls.    How to join a Zoom meeting through a web browser  You don’t need to install any extra software to join a  Zoom meeting. You can do it all through a web browser  on your computer.  1. Click on the meeting invitation URL that the host  shared via email.  2. A new tab will open on your preferred web browser.  If you don’t have the Zoom desktop app installed, the  page will urge you to download the app.  3. Ignore that and skip down to the small print: “If you  cannot download or run the application, join from  your browser.”  4. Click the highlighted text in “join from your  browser.”  5. Sign in with your name to join the meeting.    Other information  When you join a Zoom meeting hosted by another  user, you are considered an attendee. The user who  scheduled the meeting will have host controls, includ- ing muting audio, using video, sharing your screen, and  more.  An attendee can join a meeting by clicking on a Zoom  link provided by the meeting host, then follow the  prompts to download and run Zoom. You can also join  the meeting via a web browser, as discussed above.   When you’re in the meeting, you may click on the  “Start Video” button to enable your camera, or click on  the audio button to mute or unmute your microphone.  The host also has the ability to mute or unmute your mi- crophone.  You can turn your camera on or off with the  Start/Stop Video button. In the “on” position, this will  allow others to see a video image of the attendee  through their desktop, laptop or phone camera. If you  prefer others to not be able to see your image, you can  toggle the video button to the off position. In this  mode, you can still participate in the call, but other par- ticipants will not be able to see you.  There is a “chat” function in Zoom that allows you to  send questions via text sidebar. We ask you to use this  feature if you want to ask a question during the Annual  Meeting.  You can leave the meeting at any time by clicking on  the Leave Meeting option at the lower right corner of  the Zoom window.      8   The GRIT – January 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 1    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  10 Juniper Hill Road – Fence and Gate Installation  53 Rock Point Place – Repaint Front Door  71 Pinon Hill Place – Canal and Stucco Repair  190 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  235 Spring Creek Court – Roof Repairs   308 Big Horn Ridge Road - Reroof  324 Paintbrush Drive – Pitched Roof Mounted Photovol- taic Panel Installation  455 Live Oak Road – Storage Unit Installation   619 Cedar Hill Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  635 Cougar Loop – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panel In- stallation   637 Cougar Loop – New Construction   697 Bluebird Lane – Gutters and Downspouts Installa- tion  725-13 Tramway Vista Loop – Roof Mounted Photovol- taic Panel Installation  1002 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   1134 Marigold Drive – Fence Replacement  1806 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Windows  1939 Quail Run Loop – Replace Wooden Fencing and  Gates  2501 Tramway Terrace Court – Refinish Stucco  2722 Tramway Circle – Replace Shared Fence and Install  Two Gates  2879 Brushwood Street – Re-roof  12614 Colony Place – Wall Modifications          Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.   Monthly Fun Fact  By Matt Pedigo, SHHA Member    According to usclimatedata.com, Albuquerque re- ceives average annual precipitation of 9.45 inches  (1981–2010), including average annual snowfall of 10  inches. Based on data recorded at the Albuquerque  International Sunport, annual rainfall has averaged  13.3 inches in the decade since 2010. Up here in San- dia Heights, a bit more of our precipitation is in the  form of snow than at the Sunport or Civic Center.    Please Take Your Signs Down    If you haven’t already, please take down your politi- cal signs, posters and placards. Also, it’s time to put  your Christmas decorations away for the year. Let’s  keep our community tidy.          9   The GRIT – January 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 1  10 The GRIT – January 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 1 11   The GRIT – January 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 1  Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups is sponsored by SHHA.

When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of every  other month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is  typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee)  as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a  September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with  15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time  of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
