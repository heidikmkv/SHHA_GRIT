So- lar panels have gotten cheaper and are available in sizes  and efficiencies that produce more electrical power  than those that were available just a few years ago— good news for consumers. The ACC has a guideline, ACC  Design Guideline for Solar Collectors, for your use that  provides information on these types of installations.  The guideline is available at the SHHA office and online  at the SHHA website, sandiahomowners.org.  In addition to the information contained in the ACC  guideline, here are a few points to consider when plan- ning the installation of a PV system:  • A good “rule of thumb” is that here in sunny New  Mexico, a one kilowatt PV system generates about  1800 kilowatt hours of electrical power per year.  Knowing your annual energy consumption (use your  PNM records to obtain this information) along with  this “rule of thumb,” you can size a PV system to  meet your needs.  • For roof-mounted systems, make sure your roof is in  good condition. Many contractors will not install a PV  system on a “marginal” roof. Also, if your roof devel- ops problems (leaks, etc.), the presence of PV panels  makes it difficult for a roofer to gain access to those  portions of the roof under the panels. Be sure to ask  your solar installer if they have a procedure in case of  roof repair, and what the cost is of that procedure.  • Once installed, don’t let large trees next to your  home shade the panels. Any amount of shading, in- cluding clouds, reduces the electrical output of the  shaded panels.  • Orientation of the panels relative to the sun affects  their efficiency. The highest efficiency is achieved if  panels are oriented directly south at an azimuth (a  compass setting) of 180 degrees. An orientation of  ±20° from that value of 180° will result in a relatively  small (about 2–3%) decrease in system efficiency. For  Albuquerque’s latitude of 35° north, the ideal pitch  angle for the panels is about 30°. However, pitch an- gles as low as 15° will result in a decrease of only  about 6% in overall efficiency.   • Here in Sandia Heights, most PV systems have been  mounted on flat roofs. For flat-roof installations,  most PV system installers prefer to use ballasted  mounts as opposed to roof-penetrating support  mounts. Ballasted mounting usually requires that the  pitch angles of the panels be less than about 15° in or- der to limit system damage due to high wind loads.  Systems using ballasted mounting are significantly  cheaper and easier to install than those that require  roof penetrations. The use of roof penetrators per- mits panels to be installed at high efficiency pitch an- gles without worry of damage from strong winds.  The ACC has received applications for both of these  types of installations.  • For pitched roofs, PV panels can be flush mounted or  mounted at canted angles to take advantage of azi- muth and pitch-angle orientation. Please be aware  that mounting panels on pitched roofs may cause  seasonal glare issues with neighboring residences as  the sun goes through the annual solar cycle. When  the ACC approves a PV system to be mounted on a  pitched roof or to be ground-mounted, the ACC ap- proval letter contains a disclaimer that the resident is  responsible for correcting any glare issue that may be  raised by nearby property owners.  State and County statutes prohibit homeowners as- sociations from preventing the installation of solar col- lectors, so don’t worry about the ACC “shooting down”  your application for installing PV panels. The ACC’s goal  is to try to limit the negative visual impacts of these in- stallations on neighboring properties while at the same  time not causing undue efficiency reductions to your PV  system. Once your PV installation has been completed,  please take the time to provide feedback (both positive  and negative) to the SHHA office on your overall expe- rience with your contractor. I hope that these pointers  help make the planning for your proposed PV system  easier.

Recently,  I spoke with Roseann Houlihan, who lives in Unit 23,  about how her Unit has fostered neighborliness.  Unit 23 is one of the smaller ones in SHHA, comprised  of 26 patio homes on two “no-outlet” streets. Most are  couples, not families with children at home.  Nearly 20 years ago as Roseann was walking her dog,  a neighbor broached the idea of a Memorial Day block  party. They agreed it was a good idea. It’s been such a  good idea that Unit 23 residents have had annual Me- morial Day block parties ever since. It’s pot luck, out- doors in someone’s driveway (even on the heels of this  year’s wild Memorial Day thunder- and hailstorm). They  set up tables and chairs, gather a couple of grills, set out  an ice chest, and up to 35 or 40 neighbors gather. It’s  been a good opportunity to “build a stronger sense of  neighborhood identity” (See Hugh Prather’s June 2017  GRIT article, pp. 1–2), and for newer residents to get to  know their neighbors. They email the announcement a  few weeks ahead, then hand deliver paper invitations a  few days ahead, to ensure everyone gets the word.  More recently, this Unit set up a Google Group just  for their neighborhood. It’s simple and private, unlike  Nextdoor. The residents can let each other know about  security concerns, about family emergencies, or send  out invitations for neighborhood events such as the Me- morial Day block party. When a new neighbor moves in,  someone is sure to go welcome them, let them know  about the Google Group, and invite them to join it.  One of the Unit’s residents initiated the installation  of a Little Free Library in their neighborhood. It’s one of  a few in Sandia Heights—maybe you’ve seen them. (Go  to Homepage - Little Free Library for more info on find- ing or starting one.)  About five years ago, one resident suggested they  set up Neighborhood Watch in their Unit. Roseann is  the Neighborhood Watch Leader, and said the process  is straightforward, but does need leadership. The best  place to start is Neighborhood Watch Program  (bernco.gov) where we find all the information and  how-to’s. (Again, see Hugh Prather’s June 2017 GRIT ar- ticle for more on this.)  The residents of Unit 23 have also banded together  to revise their Unit’s Covenants when they found them  unenforceable or outdated. While many people see  Covenants as a negative thing restricting our freedoms,  Roseann said their experience of joining together to up- date their covenants was a very positive one. The cove- nant update was a chance to work together towards a  common goal and gave each resident a voice in the de- cisions. (See last month’s GRIT front page and Proce- dure for Property Owners Covenants at sandiahomown- ers.org for more on the process.)  Not everyone wants to be buddies with their neigh- bors or be involved in each other’s lives. That’s okay! Be- ing a good neighbor means respecting each other’s pri- vacy and peace as much as it involves reaching out to  each other. Not every household in Unit 23 wants to be  involved in socials or Neighborhood Watch or the  Google group, but for those who do, the opportunity is  there.  Whether initiating neighborhood-wide social events,  keeping track of new folks, or doing Neighborhood  Watch, Roseann says it’s a good idea to have two or  three folks willing and committed to share the leader- ship, for moral support as well as for sharing the tasks.

When you bought or rented in San- dia Heights, you agreed to follow your Unit covenants  which have restrictions on parking your recreational ve- hicles on your lot. SHHA does not look for violations, but  rather investigates complaints submitted by your neigh- bors whose names are not divulged. After investigation,  if there is a violation, you will receive a letter from the  SHHA asking you to correct the problem. There are fur- ther consequences for failure to remove the RV.  In some instances, a homeowner has built a separate  garage which is large enough to park the RV. The RV is  completely enclosed and not visible from the street.  This is perfectly satisfactory. The objective of our cove- nants is to maintain the natural beauty and environment  of our community and, thereby, maintain our property  values. No one wants Sandia Heights to look like a trailer  park.  Below is a list of local facilities that will store RVs, mo- torhomes, boats, campers, and trailers:     Paseo Covered RV Storage  7950 Jacs Lane NE  505-310-8290    Blue Sky RV and Boat Storage  7800 Jacs Lane NE  505-697-2458    Malcolm Properties RV Storage  2525 Aztec Rd.

Oftentimes, there is a wait list.      48 hours before and after your trip, otherwise      Too Close for Comfort    We’ve already had a  fire near us this sea- son. This brush fire  burned  on  the  south side of Paseo  near Tramway on  June 14. It was still a  week until summer  then.

Tumbleweeds  By Vivian George, Sandia Heights resident    Hi everyone. Tumbleweeds (Kali tragus, or Russian  thistle) are invading the neighborhood. They prefer  freshly disturbed soil. They are easy to deal with now  and very difficult to deal with when they get big and  stickery. Please join other neighbors and me in pulling  any that you find. The biggest culprit I see is the new  development at Paseo and Tramway. On Tramway  Lane the roadway is lined on either side with hundreds  of them. I have also noticed that when folks get their  septic replaced, the tumbleweeds are the first plants  to pop up. Tumbleweeds are an invasive species and  will choke out the less aggressive natives, like an  apache plume I rescued recently from 6 tumbleweeds.  I have denuded the arroyo area of tumbleweeds but I  can’t do everything by myself. I need help!!!  Parts of young tumbleweeds are edible! The web- site Eat The Weeds says, “the young shoots and tips of  the growing plant are edible raw and actually quite pal- atable and pickable. Cooked like greens they’re even  better.” Maybe we can eat our way out of this mess!  Editor’s note: Ms. George and 3 of her neighbors  spent an hour on a recent Saturday pulling up most of  the green tumbleweeds next to the wall on the east  side of the new construction on Tramway Lane. What  a great, neighborly thing to do. Thank you!!        Young tumbleweed plant.       Dry tumbleweed. Hard to deal with.  9  The GRIT – July 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 7 10  The GRIT – July 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 7 11   The GRIT – July 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 7  Community Event Bulletin Board      These groups are not  sponsored by SHHA.

We are hopeful that it will be an in-person tour with 36 artists displaying their work at various homes  around the Heights. Once again, a variety of media will be on display from paintings to ceramics, to jewelry, etc. SAVE  THE DATES!!    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are still cancelled. We hope  to start meeting again soon on the second Saturday of every other month, gathering in the homes of our members.  Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone  rotating (host/attendee) as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with  attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during  the year, one a September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in  September 2005, with 15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To  inquire or join any time of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
