Applications re- ceived before December allow time for the candidate to be interviewed (cur- rently being done remotely) and, if accepted by the Nominating Committee,  to be announced two months before the Annual Meeting in February. Then  the member resident attendees at the Annual Meeting vote on the candi- date(s) for the Board. Your service on the Board would start immediately af- ter the Annual Meeting.  Being on the Board is a great way to help make our wonderful community  even better. We need all kinds of people with all kinds of skills. Look to the  left. You’ll see the various committees that do the heavy lifting for SHHA.  Board members are expected to be on at least one committee. Do you want  to be sure our property values remain solid and our community beautiful? Ar- chitectural Control or Covenant Support might be for you. They are in partic- ular need of those with a background in law (ahem, you attorneys out there)  and welcome other members, too. Are you a writer, an editor or a web wiz?  Communications & Publications is right up your alley. Would you like to work  directly with the membership and our merchant members? Then look at Com- munity Service & Membership. Do you know about environmental concerns,  wildfire mitigation, personal and community safety? Parks & Safety is your  best fit. Are you not quite sure? New Board Directors have a couple of months  to figure out where to make their contributions.  Click on this link: http://www.sandiahomeowners.org/forms and scroll to  the bottom. Now print out the statement of interest, fill it in, and drop it off  at the office or scan it and email it in to one of the email addresses to the left.  That’s all there is to applying. Couldn’t be simpler. Hope to work with you on  next year’s Board.    We’d Like Your Thoughts on the Website  Susan McCasland, Communications & Publications Committee Chair    The design and basic layout of the SHHA website, www.sandiahomeown- ers.org, is 10 years old and a bit dated and tired. It’s time to give it a makeover.  We’d love to hear what you would like to see in the website—not only what  content and information, but also your thoughts on functionality. You can  send your ideas to TheGritSHHA@gmail.com.     2   The GRIT – November 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 11  Letter to the Editor on   Thistles in Sandia Heights  from Dan Benton    Joe Boyce’s article in the October GRIT (p. 7) leaves the  unfortunate impression that purple thistles in Sandia  Heights are an invasive species. The reality is that the pur- ple thistle in Sandia Heights is our own native Cirsium ne- omexicanum. A similar species is our native Cirsuim undu- lata. I have been chasing reports of invasive thistles on the  west side of the Sandias for over 15 years as a U. S. Forest  Service volunteer and have never found one. New Mexico  is home to twelve native thistle species and two are listed  as federally and state threatened or endangered species.  All are ecologically important for pollinators and are in- nocuous in their native habitat, i.e., Sandia Heights. Be- fore anyone starts pulling out our native thistles, I hope  they would consult the guide to New Mexico thistles at  http://www.npsnm.org/education/thistle-identification- booklet/.  [ed., thank you for the information, Dan. We appreci- ate it.]    Invasive Trees in Sandia Heights  Covenant Support Committee    There is a growing awareness in Sandia Heights that  trees, as they grow, proliferate, and mature, are causing  a gradual loss of our valley and mountain views, contrib- uting to mounting water usage and septic system  maintenance costs, and decreasing our property values.  It is important that homeowners know what trees  should be considered weeds in Sandia Heights and how  they can be controlled.  According to Mr. Joran Viers, past horticulturalist for  the Bernalillo County Extension Service, Tree of Heaven  and Siberian Elm should be considered weeds in Sandia  Heights. Siberian elms are considered the greater pre- sent threat.  Siberian Elm  According to Baker H. Morrow, Best Plants for New  Mexico Gardens & Landscapes, Siberian elm is “almost  supernaturally hardy; thrives in any soil with little or no  water and is not affected by heat or cold.” It “can grow  to 80 feet in height, with a 50-foot crown” and “reseeds  itself profusely in early spring.”  The USDA has determined that Siberian elm is suffi- ciently invasive, damaging, and difficult to control to be  deemed a noxious weed. Because it is wide-spread in  New Mexico, it is classified by the NM Dept of Agriculture  as a Class C noxious weed.  Our covenants restrict houses to 2 stories or less in or- der to be in harmony with the surroundings and so as not  to create an undue obstruction of views. At present, a few  Siberian elms already tower over 2-story houses and  there are hundreds, soon to be thousands, of Siberian elm  saplings rapidly growing to join them. It would be prudent  for all of us to be aware of this condition and to consider  effective actions to control this growing threat to our  views and quality of life. Mr. Viers advises that when re- moving Siberian elm, the trunk should be cut as close to  the ground as possible and the stump treated with an  herbicide. (Untreated stumps and roots will sprout new  saplings.) He recommends the use of Garlon-4 to treat  the stump. The threat constituted by the proliferation  of Siberian elm is one of the very few instances he be- lieves where the use of an herbicide is justified. Garlon- 4 can be purchased online and applied to the freshly cut  stump at any time during the year. A less expensive al- ternative is sold under the name of the active ingredi- ent, Triclopyr4.  The Siberian Elm invasion in Sandia Heights in many  ways is comparable with the Salt Cedar invasion of the  Rio Grande Bosque, which was allowed to continue far  too long. It is now costing enormous amounts of money  and effort to rid the Bosque of this weed. If you have  Siberian Elm seedlings on your property it would be a lot  easier to remove them now rather than deal with them  later after they have become very large trees.

Historical Article from the April 1985 GRIT  Church of the Good Shepherd’s Dedication Set  for Sunday, May 5 [1985]  New Building is Designed for Congregation’s and  Community’s Use    With construction at 7833 Tramway Blvd NE [note: not  current mailing address] beginning in the late summer  of 1984, Church of the Good Shepherd (UCC) opened its  doors for services on Sunday, March 24. Dedication  Sunday is to be held on May 5…. All residents of the  Sandia Heights community are cordially invited.  The Church of the Good Shepherd is a local unit of the  United Church of Christ, a liberal mainline Protestant  denomination of two million members—a union of  Congregational-Christian  and  Evangelical-Reformed  Churches whose roots go all the way back to the  founding fathers of our land and to the heart of the  Reformation spirit.   The new building was designed to accommodate an  expanded church membership as well as to serve the  needs of a large variety of community organizations and  groups.       The CSC Protects  Homeowner Information  Bob Thomas, CSC Chair    The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) has responsi- bility for enforcing the Sandia Heights Covenants. The  Covenants are on file with the Bernalillo County Clerk,  and the CSC has legal authority to enforce the Cove- nants, through the courts if necessary.  The CSC has an established procedure for homeown- ers to file a Covenant violation complaint, and an estab- lished process for CSC members to investigate the valid- ity of the complaint. Throughout this process, the iden- tities of the complainant, the alleged violator, the ad- dress, and the nature of the complaint are considered  strictly confidential and never divulged outside of the  CSC. Furthermore, the specific actions taken by the CSC  to resolve a complaint are also considered strictly confi- dential.  The relationship between the CSC and the homeown- ers is built on trust that has been established over many  years. The CSC trusts the homeowners are familiar with  the Covenants in their unit and, when needed, bring to  the CSC valid violations. The homeowners trust the CSC  to investigate alleged violations thoroughly and enforce  the covenants. And finally, the homeowners trust the  CSC to treat the complaints with strict confidentiality  and shield their identities. I commit to you that the CSC  will not betray this trust.

However, fighting  ceased seven months earlier when an armistice, or tem- porary cessation of hostilities, between the Allied na- tions and Germany went into effect on the eleventh  hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. For  that reason, November 11, 1918, is generally regarded as  the end of “the war to end all wars.”    Soldiers of the 353rd Infantry near a church at Stenay, Meuse in France,  wait for the end of hostilities.  This photo was taken at 10:58 a.m., on No- vember 11, 1918, two minutes before the armistice ending World War I  went into effect    In November 1919, President Wilson proclaimed No- vember 11 as the first commemoration of Armistice Day  with the following words: “To us in America, the reflec- tions of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in  the heroism of those who died in the country’s service  and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the  thing from which it has freed us and because of the op- portunity it has given America to show her sympathy  with peace and justice in the councils of the nations…”  The original concept for the celebration was for a day  observed with parades and public meetings and a brief  suspension of business beginning at 11:00 AM.  The United States Congress officially recognized the  end of World War I when it passed a concurrent resolu- tion on June 4, 1926. An Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U. S. Code,  Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made the 11th of No- vember in each year a legal holiday—a day to be  dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be there- after celebrated and known as “Armistice Day.” Armi- stice Day was primarily a day set aside to honor veterans  of World War I, but in 1954, after World War II had re- quired the greatest mobilization of soldiers, sailors, Ma- rines and airmen in the Nation’s history and after Amer- ican forces had fought aggression in Korea, the 83rd  Congress, at the urging of the veterans’ service organi- zations, amended the Act of 1938 by striking out the  word “Armistice” and inserting in its place the word  “Veterans.” With the approval of this legislation (Public  Law 380) on June 1, 1954, November 11th became a day  to honor American veterans of all wars.

SH Hacks & Tips  Many of us have septic systems to dispose of our waste.  Here are a few tips on keeping your relationship with  your septic system on the right track.  • Limit garbage disposal effluent. Not only is garbage  not particularly healthy for the septic bugs, but it fills  up your holding tank a lot faster.   • Be kind to your septic bugs. They’re working for you.  Limit bleach and other harsh chemicals. Try to stag- ger laundry loads through the week rather than all  on a single day. Look for septic-safe products. Some  people like to add bacteria to their tanks periodically  to keep the colony size healthy.  • Don’t let your tank fill up and overflow into the leach  field. That could result in needing to replace the  leach field, which costs several thousand $$$. Have  the tank pumped periodically—depending on usage  and tank size, that’s probably between 3 and 6 years.        9  The GRIT – November 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 11 10  The GRIT – November 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 11 11   The GRIT November – Volume 37 – No. 11  Community Events Bulletin Board      This group is not sponsored by SHHA.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.

Email us at thegritshha@gmail.com.  Last Chance!! Send in Your Photos Now!  We are accepting your entries for our annual photo contest for the Sandia  Heights 2022 Resident Guide & Directory. Submissions are due to the SHHA  office by Friday, November 5, 2021. If you are the lucky winner, your photo  will be featured on the cover of the 2022 Resident Guide and Directory, and  you will be acknowledged as the photographer.       Submission criteria are as follows:  •  You must be a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association and you must be an amateur photographer.  • Photos must be related to the Sandia Heights area (see the 2021 and earlier Directories).  • Photos must fit reasonably on the cover without loss of the composition.  • Photos must be in color and may be submitted digitally to shha@sandiahomeowners.org or as a hardcopy  print to the office. All hardcopy entries may be picked up at the office once the Directory is published.  • The resident must submit a statement that the photograph is an original taken by the homeowner, that  they are not a professional photographer (in business as a photographer), and that they grant permission  to SHHA to use their photo(s) in the Directory or on the SHHA website.  Last chance for 2022 Directory Changes, too  Take a look at your entry in The Resident’s Guide and Directory for 2021 and see if you want any changes to it for  2022. There are two places to look: under your last name and by your street address. Ideally, they are the same  information. If not, or if you want different information, please notify the SHHA office by Friday, November 5.   If you are a new resident in 2021, you should check with the office to see if the information to be published is  what you want. You have a choice of being identified, or of just being “Resident” in the address part of the  Directory with or without a phone number and without being in the by-name section. You can also be named,  but not have your phone number provided. Check with the office if you have any questions.  Monthly Fun Fact  “Albuquerque” is the only word in the English language that repeats the letter sequence “que” twice. Of course,  our city was named for the Spanish Duke of Alburquerque, specifically the 10th such duke, Francisco Fernández  de la Cueva (1686–1733) who was also Viceroy of New Spain. (Somewhere along the way the city’s name lost an  “r”.) Hence the city’s nickname: The Duke City. And our local high school’s name: La Cueva. And the high school’s  mascot? You might think they’d be The Dukes—but no…they’re The Bears.  Semi-annual Tramway Trash Pickup  SHHA has “adopted” the stretch of Tramway between Simms and Paseo. If you’d like to help with the trash  pickup, meet at the SHHA office at 9:00 on Saturday, November 6. Trash bags and high-visibility vests will be  provided. See you there!
