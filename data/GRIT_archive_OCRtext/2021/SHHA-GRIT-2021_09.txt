By Susan McCasland, Nominating Committee chair    Have you ever considered being on you homeowners’ association Board  of Directors? It is a great way to be an integral part of and give back to your  community. And now is the time to submit a Statement of Interest so that  there’s ample time for you to be interviewed by the present Board mem- bers and presented for election to the member residents at the Annual  Meeting in February.   So, what is expected of you if you are on the SHHA Board of Directors?  First, you need to be a homeowner/landowner and a member of the SHHA.  Do you see a line on your water & sanitation bill for $8.50? If so, you’re a  member already. If not, call the office and sign up. The Board meets the  second Wednesday of every month (except February) at 6:30. At present,  we meet virtually for 2 months and in-person for the 3rd month. But that  may soon become a hybrid (in-person and on-line) meeting every month.  Bottom line is you don’t need to be concerned about impacts to your  health from being an active Board member. Board meetings typically last  1.5 hours and cover finances, architectural and covenant issues, environ- ment, safety, membership, activities, publications and myriad other issues  affecting our members and residents. Plus, you get to know some very in- teresting people who are fellow Board members.   Board members are also expected to serve on one of the standing com- mittees. Look directly to the left of this sentence to see a list of the com- mittees.  Board terms are for 3 years.  If this has piqued your interest, please fill out and return a Statement of  Interest; you can find one on the SHHA website at https://www.san- diahomeowners.org/forms near the bottom of the page or stop by the of- fice to pick up a paper copy.    2   The GRIT – September 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 9  The Artists are Back!  By Elizabeth Edgren, Community Service   & Membership Committee chair    The 18th Annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour is al- most here! Mark your calendar for Sept 25th–26th from  10 AM to 5 PM, and check the website for details: artists |  sandiaheightsartists  I’d never heard of an artists’ studio tour before I  moved here, but these are a growing—and wonder- ful—trend. As Kathleen McCaughey (who works with  silver, unique stones and  semi-precious gems) said,  “People like this kind of  thing. It’s an opportunity to  ‘peek’ into the windows of  others.” While they’re all  busy preping for the Tour,  several were kind enough  to answer my questions.  Sandia  Heights’  Tour  used to be a more casual,  “neighbors visiting neighbors,” but it’s no longer just  that. People come from all over ABQ and farther afield.  Tourists and other artists join SH residents to visit many  artists working in many mediums. As our neighborhood,   city, and the Tour have grown, so has traffic to our Tour.  One thing we enjoy in SH is the quiet and lack of traffic,  but if we’re honest many of us are also proud to show  off our beautiful neighborhood. Some of our artists be- lieve it’s good for others to get a feel for our special  area. One might argue that Sandia Heights itself is the  unnamed grand studio on the Tour.  I’d be cautious about it—but many artists are willing  to have us descend upon their homes for two days par- ticipate in the Tour. Many display in their garages and  patios so we don’t completely invade their privacy.  Kathleen said she finds the direct interaction with her  customers “more enriching.” She  can see when people get excited  about her work, what they like or  don’t like, and gets on-the-spot  feedback, which is critical for  many artists. Michele McMillan  loves “meeting new people, es- pecially people in my neighbor- hood. It is an exhilarating, fun day  spent talking to local friends and  neighbors.” Lars Strong, artist in  wood, stone, and photography,  enjoys meeting a variety of people, “discovering who  they are and how they interact and respond with art,”  and “sharing the background stories that accompany  each of my pieces.” For us who tour, it’s a unique op- portunity, as Strong says, “to see extraordinary crea- tions and to meet the characters that make them. Many  of us are not famous, but our lack of fame is not due to  a lack of talent or creativity. There are many extremely  talented artists quietly doing ‘their thing’ for them- selves because they need to create. The Tour may be  the only place you can see their work. It’s also a win-win  opportunity to purchase art directly from the makers.”  Most of the artists are indeed our neighbors, but the  Tour invites a handful of guest artists, too, who bring  diversity to the show. One of this year’s guests, back for  a second time, is Catalina Salinas, a painter in oils. Born  and raised in La Paz, Bolivia, she’s influenced by the high  mountains, indigenous cultures, the “bright colors and  geometrical patterns of ‘aguayos,’ which are Aymaran  textiles.” Catalina says the Tour is special, a time to “see  many different artists working and supporting one an- other, and welcoming people to their personal space.”  Some of our artists have been at their creative work  since their youth; others began later in life.   Laura  McIndoo,  who  makes functional pottery,  has been ‘potter-ing’ for 28  years, almost 20 of those  here in SH. Silversmith and  jewelry  maker  Michele  McMillan is a long-time SH  North resident, but a much  more recent artist; she  started making sterling sil- ver jewelry in 2011 when her boys went off to university.  Lars Strong is sort of the reverse—creating art all his life  (although formally for 15 years), but a SH resident just  the past four years.  The pandemic hit each of our artists differently, of  course. Potter McIndoo’s day job is teaching at CNM;  adjusting to online teaching meant longer, more ex- hausting days. “I hardly did any pottery all year. Thank- fully, summer vacation came along and I was able to  start creating again.” McMillan primarily sells her silver  and jewelry through galleries and shops, and the pan- demic put a stop to those sales for a year. She says,  “I’ve always thought it would be a good idea to have a  website, so the pandemic forced me to think more  about  this.”   She  worked  to  develop  a  website,  even    Kathleen McCaughey    Laura McIndoo    Michele McMillan  3   The GRIT – September 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 9    hiring a videographer “to create a video showing my  work area inspirations and many of my pieces.” Guest  artist Salinas, like McIndoo, is a teacher. With the tiring  demands of balancing virtual and in-person teaching,  even if she had time, she didn’t always have the energy  to tackle large, intense, mul- tiple-day projects. To have  time to do art for relaxation,  she began a series of smaller  watercolor pieces and exper- imented with other media.  And some surprising oppor- tunities came up with other  artists to exchange small pro- jects or to collaborate in  community projects. A mural  project involved over 40 oth- ers “creating individual pieces that were put together  as a puzzle of our city.” (The final mural is now on dis- play at the Kress Building at 416 Central SW; sales pro- ceeds will benefit local art programs.)   Woodworker Strong, on the other hand, had more  studio time than usual, and was able to do even more  hiking, biking, and exploring. Being outdoors inspired  him and provided him more materials to work with.  “Also,” he says, “in the general uncertainty, fear, and  upheaval of the pandemic, I deepened my appreciation  for beauty and my desire to create unique sculptural  forms as an offering of beauty into a world that seems  to need beauty more than ever.”  Set aside Saturday & Sunday, September 25th & 26th  to take in some art. Take time to talk with the artists.  They each have their story of inspiration, of training, of  experience and vision, which we don’t have space for  here. And as Ms. Salinas says, “You don’t need to be an  art collector to appreciate art. All humans are moved by  creativity.” Go to a variety of stops on the tour, even the  ones you think aren’t your thing, and go prepared to  buy! When you “indulge” in that item that keeps draw- ing your eye back to it again and again, you’re support- ing an entrepreneur, a neighbor, their creativity and in- dependence as well as enriching and beautifying your  world. And lest we forget, the artists make donations  for La Mesa School art program, as we customers can,  too, during the Tour.  Thanks to Kathleen McCaughey, Mary Ellen Merrigan,  Laura McIndoo, Michele McMillan, Lars Strong, and Cata- lina Salinas for their time and input!      A Lively Lecture & Book Signing  By Ruth Frazier, SH resident    Love dogs? Books? And a humane organization?  St. Chad’s Church will feature all three on Friday, Sep- tember 24, from 6–8 PM, for a family-friendly event: THE  LAST HOWLELUJAH, TALES FROM THE TRAIL.  Father Bill Miller, an Episcopal priest from Round  Top, Texas, will be here to sign his most recent book,  The Last Howlelujah, an amazing story of a dog named  Nawililiwilli (Wili) Nelson. Father Bill will also talk about  the incredible dogs in his life. He donates proceeds from  book sales and contributions to a humane organization  of our choice, and we have selected the Watermelon  Mountain Ranch, New Mexico’s largest no-kill animal  shelter. There will be dogs available for adoption, too.  Refreshments will be provided, we’ll be outdoors,  and there will even be a dog parade of interesting  dogs—and their tales!  Father Jeremiah Griffin, Rector of St. Chad’s, knows  Father Bill and says “come to hear a remarkable story of  a man who has found the divine connection for humans  and their pets.”  It’s free, but donations happily accepted. Call Ruth  Frazier (505) 250-9961 for more information.

Rudin, SH resident, former CSC member    The monsoon rains have greened up the desert beauti- fully...but have also brought out WEEDS!  The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) receives  scores of complaints about landscaping and yard  maintenance, particularly in units comprised of patio  homes. If you own a property with zero lot lines, think  about the obvious importance of curb appeal and the  need for attractive frontage so close to the street and  so visible among clustered homes. Residents in the  zero-lot-line units should be mindful that the appear- ance of their yards has a greater impact on the sur- rounding neighbors than is the case with larger lots.  Please help your neighborhood, yourselves, and the  CSC by controlling your landscape and weeds through- out the growing season. Don’t wait until plants are un- wieldy, become woody, or constitute fire and/or safety  hazards. Just as we schedule haircuts every so often,  let’s keep our properties looking cared for and attrac- tive. In fact, while we’re at it, let’s remove our dead  vegetation too: this is one covenant that applies to all  property-owners. Good landscape maintenance will  help keep our home values strong, our streets safer  due to fire prevention and clear sightlines for vehicles,  bicycles, and pedestrians, and Sandia Heights as beau- tiful as it can be.  As a helpful guide for property owners, these photos  provide examples of “do”s and “don’t”s.  Last month’s GRIT had an article by a resident suggesting that people pull tumble- weeds. With the wonderful, “normal” monsoon rains we’ve had, the tumbleweed inva- sion is now everywhere! Please, check your property and pull all the tumbleweeds you  find. They’re easy to pull now—soon that won’t be the case.  DO    Keep soil and gravel raked and inhospitable to weeds.    Prune trees, pull weeds, and trim hedges adjoining other lots.    Keep curbs tidy and corners cleared and visible.  DON’T    Don’t let weeds go to seed & dead plants convey neglect.    Don’t allow weeds to encroach on your neighbor’s property.    Don’t let weeds occupy driveway cracks, giving your home an  abandoned appearance and perhaps inviting suspicious activity.  8   The GRIT – September 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 9  ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  19 Cedar Hill Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation  21 Cedar Hill Road – Repaint Trim   68 Pinon Hill Place - Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation  176 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Deck Installation  618 Cedar Hill Road – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation   641 Cougar Loop – Reroof and Re-stucco   629 Cougar Loop – Remove and Replace a Portion of As- phalt Driveway, Replace Door, and Add a Gutter  647 Cougar Loop – Remove and Replace House Siding  with Stucco  655 Roadrunner Lane – Re-stucco   726-21 Tramway Vista Drive – Replace Heat Pump with  A/C and Gas Unit Installation   795-K Tramway Lane – Replace Beams on Two Balconies   983 Lynx Loop – New Construction   987 Lynx Loop – Landscaping   1019 Tramway Lane – Re-stucco   1063 Red Oaks Loop – Replace Window and Re-stucco  1134 Marigold Drive – Removal of Solar Trombe Wall  1233 Goldenrod Drive – Replace Windows   1424 San Rafael Avenue – Replace Garage Doors   1553 Eagle Ridge Lane – Restoration of Roof with Tan  Silicon Coating  1604 Quailwood Drive – Re-stucco   1703 Quail Run Court – Replace Windows and Re-stucco  House  8229 Raintree Drive – Reroof   8234 Raintree Drive - Landscaping   9117 Tramway Lane – Landscaping   12618 Colony Place – Replace Evaporative Cooler with  Refrigerated Air Unit       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.       Wildfire    Here’s another video on mitigating the danger to your  home from a wildfire: https://youtu.be/bPlLXb_MHuo:  Wildfire Defensible Space: Zone Zero      Monthly Fun Fact    Albuquerque’s Old Town is a favorite spot for both  tourists and residents. Old Town Plaza has been a  crossroad since it was founded in 1706. Four flags have  flown over the Plaza: Spain, Mexico, the U.S., and the  state of New Mexico.                SH Tips & Hacks    It’s still pretty hot out. One way to keep the interior of  you home cooler is to minimize the “solar loading” from  your windows. All that means is to keep the shades or  curtains closed on the windows the sun is shining on. To  stay on top of solar loading, you need to be aware of  where the sun is and where it will be in the near future.  So, mornings, keep east window shades drawn. Mid-day,  the south-facing windows should be blocked. Then in the  afternoon, keep the west windows darkened. You’ll be  amazed at how much cooler your house is and how much  less cooling you need to keep your house comfortable.    9  The GRIT – September 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 9 10  The GRIT – September 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 9 11   The GRIT – September 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 9  Community Events Bulletin Board      Neither of these groups is sponsored by SHHA.

Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork has resumed  our bimonthly dinners. We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
