Just in the black banner at the top of the home page we find:  • GRIT Newsletters for the past five years  • The “Outdoors” button has a wealth of information about:   o Wildlife—photos and articles  o Landscape—includes problem trees and local gardening articles  o Trails—etiquette and ‘Leave No Trace’ info, a map and list of trails  in the Sandia area  o Water—conservation and septic-system info  • “Photo Gallery” features beautiful pictures of our neighborhood and  its environs taken by Sandia Heights residents. These were submitted  as candidates for the cover of our Resident Guide and Directory.  • Under “Unit Covenants,” you can find the covenants of every unit in  SHHA.  • “Forms” provides links to Architectural Control application and evalu- ation forms, Covenant Support forms, Board and Membership forms,  and others, all of which you may conveniently print out at home.  • “Wildfire Preparedness” covers prevention, anticipation, readiness,  and recovery. In 2018, the SHHA Board of Directors established a Spe- cial Committee for Planning & Response to Wildfires (or the Wildfire  Preparedness Planning Committee—WPPC). They assembled all the  wonderful resources on this page of our website. You’ll find links to  related county and state websites which offer general as well as de- tailed guidelines and recommendations. You’ll find preparedness tips  for pets, for older adults, for making a family disaster plan and packing  a “GO” bag, as well as wildfire preparedness recommendations for  house and landscaping.  • The “Calendar” shows upcoming Board and Committee meetings.  • “Contact Us” gives you phone numbers and email addresses, the office  address, and instructions for contacting a Board member or Commit- tee Chair.  Additionally, under “Notices and Information,” you can see if there are  still discounted tram passes available for the date you want. But you still  have to go to the office to get them.  Enjoy exploring your SHHA website! And if there’s something else you’d  like to see, let us know. If we can, we’ll add it.  2   The GRIT – April 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 4  Dog FAQs  By Joe Boyce, Parks & Safety Committee Chair    First, there is a lot of useful info at ABQ Animal Welfare:   https://www.cabq.gov/pets.  Where can we take our dog for exercise off leash? The  two closest, enclosed city dog parks are   • Canine Skyline Dog Park, 12700 Montgomery NE.  Open 6 AM to 10 PM.  • N. Domingo Baca Dog Park, 7520 Corona NE. Lighted.  Open 6 AM to 10 PM.  Dog park rules:   Park users and dog owners assume all risk related to  dog park use. Each owner or handler is legally and fi- nancially responsible for the actions of their dog.   Dogs must be kept on a leash until inside the double- gated entry. Enter the first gate with the leash on and  remove it prior to entering the second gate. Do the  reverse when leaving.   Dogs must be under voice control and in sight of han- dlers at all times. Limit: 3 dogs/owner.   Any dog exhibiting aggressive behavior must be  leashed and removed immediately.   Owners must clean up and properly dispose of waste  left by their dog(s), and fill any holes dug.   Puppies using the park must be older than six  months. Un-neutered male dogs and female dogs in  heat are not permitted.   Children younger than 12 are not allowed inside the  off-leash dog exercise area unless accompanied by  an adult. Parents must refrain from bringing toddlers  and small children to the dog park. At no time should  children be allowed to run with or chase after dogs in  the park.   No food or drinks allowed within the fenced area.  How about off-leash within the neighborhood? Al- though some people let their usually “well-socialized  and non-aggressive” dogs off leash while walking in the  nearby open space and national forest, it’s not really le- gal and risks liability for the owner, harm for the pets,  lost dogs, etc. Even the best-behaved dog has a hard  time resisting chasing a deer, coyote, or rabbit. And  other leashed dogs may not appreciate a sudden visit  from an off-leash “intruder.” Better to keep them on  leash and in control at all times. Even so, some owners  will take the chance, so be aware of off-leash dogs and  give the owners a chance to leash them if you encoun- ter them while walking. And remember, the arroyos and  most walking areas other than the streets are private  property. Abuse it and lose it.    What do we do about dog waste? #1 dog complaint in  the area! Every owner should always have bags with  them for pickup while walking. Just kicking poop under  a bush is a great way to have tons of flies—don’t be that  guy or gal. There are SHHA-provided bags and trash  cans at several key locations (let the office know if the  bags need replacing). And please don’t leave filled bags  lying by the side of the trail thinking you will be coming  back later. It’s too easy to forget. You wouldn’t do it  with other trash, would you?  What can I do about my neighbor’s barking dogs?  First, talk nicely to the owner. Second, talk to the owner  nicely again. If that still doesn’t work, it may take a call  to Bernalillo County Animal Control at (505) 468-7387.  SHHA will not typically get involved.   My dog is lost! Right now, make sure they are micro- chipped and have current tags with your phone num- ber; it’s much more likely they will be returned. The best  bets (beyond flyers and friends looking) are to post  online with Nextdoor.com and Pawboost.com (covers  Facebook). Check https://petharbor.com/ for a searcha- ble database with pictures from ABQ shelters. Call and  drop by too. You will need proof of ownership, vaccina- tions, and neutering to get them back.   What if I find a lost dog? Approach them slowly, and  don’t chase them, especially on a busy road. If you are  able to catch them safely, check for ID/tag/phone num- ber, and provide water and food, if needed. Next step is  to see if they have a microchip—many vets and ABQ  shelters will scan for free. Keep a stray isolated from  your pets. Check Nextdoor and Pawboost, but don’t put  a complete description or picture online; let the owner  describe them to be sure. Dog-fighting scumbags have  been known to pick up strays on false pretenses. Drop  them at a no-kill shelter, if needed. There are counselors  at 311 or (505) 768-2000 who can walk you through the  options before turning the dog over to the shelter.   What about Adopting? No reason to pay when so  many deserving adorable, adoptable dogs are waiting  for your love. https://www.cabq.gov/pets/adoptions   Are there 24-hour emergency vet services? Try your  own vet first and ask them who they recommend. VCA  and Veterinary Emergency Specialty Center, both on  Montgomery and Route 66 on Central are 24/7/365.  There are lots of good first aid books and web sites. A  good start is https://topdogtips.com/first-aid-for-dogs/.  Traumas:  My  dog  got  skunked!  Home  remedy:  1  quart  of  3%   3   The GRIT – April 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 4    hydrogen peroxide, 1/2 cup of baking soda (sodium bi- carbonate), 1 teaspoon of liquid soap. Rinse well and re- peat. Don’t get it in their eyes. You might also try a to- mato-juice bath.  My dog got snake bit! Try to identify the type of snake  without getting bit yourself. Rattlesnakes have a trian- gular head, elliptical pupils, and thicker middles than rat  and bull snakes. Non-venomous snakes have round pu- pils and oval heads in North America. Coral snakes (red  to yellow, kill a fellow) are the exception. Take a pic if  you can. Look for the 2-fang punctures of a venomous  snake. Keep the dog on leash and calm if possible. Hope- fully it’s a “dry,” no-venom warning bite (true 40–50% of  the time). Swelling and pain go with venom. The only  real remedy is snake anti-venom, so contact your vet  and get your dog there ASAP.  My dog stepped on/got into cactus. Carry tweezers or  pliers. My favorite small knife/pliers is the Gerber Dime.   My dog got into a fight. Nothing works 100% to break  them up. Most fights will be over when one dog sub- mits, but sometimes not. If another dog is going after  yours, some say a stick or a kick, some say pick the ag- gressor up by their back legs all the way off the ground  if you can. Grabbing and twisting the leash can work but  can result in bites, even from your own dog. Take pics  for later. Wash wounds and visit the vet, if needed.   My dog pulls on the leash! There are lots of good  training options and opinions, mostly based on food  and positive reinforcement. Just tugging on a choke col- lar and yelling doesn’t work. It’s mostly about training  ourselves to be consistent, not the dog. The “gentle  leader” leash often works wonders for persistent pull- ing despite training.   Where do I find a dog sitter or boarding? There are a  number of local folks who will stay at your place or take  your dogs to theirs, thus avoiding the stress of board- ing—much easier on the dog. Word-of-mouth refer- ences and Nextdoor have info and prices. If you do need  to board or use doggy daycare, there are several of  these businesses around town.      PNM Substation Update  By Robert Hare, ACC Member    On March 3rd, the Bernalillo County Planning Commis- sion held a Zoom meeting to vote on the proposed  changes necessary for the PNM Palomas substation  that was to be built on the southwest corner of Paseo  Del Norte and Browning.  PNM started the meeting by explaining the need for  the substation and how they want to keep loads on ex- isting substations under 70% of planned capacity. With  this extra capacity and the way the grid is designed, it  allows them to provide redundancy in case of substa- tion failures. PNM stated that the existing substations  servicing North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights  are already past the desired load and are not able to  support additional loads coming from new construc- tion. They explained the failures in the existing substa- tions could result in extended (days or longer) outages.  The North Albuquerque Acres Community Associa- tion was strongly opposed to the construction of the  substation at the planned location. The Association and  its members, especially those in proximity to the substa- tion, were on the Zoom call. More than 30 people spoke  in opposition to the substation. The primary concerns  were that PNM was ignoring the long-term sector plan  and that they delayed building the substation until it  was critical. They believed that the substation should be  placed farther west where the higher-density housing,  commercial, and industrial areas are located and where  the substation was placed in the long-term sector plans.  The Association and its members felt that the primary  reason for PNM’s decision to place the substation in  North Albuquerque Acres was due to the cheaper land  acquisition costs.  The commission voted unanimously to deny PNM’s  request. At this time, it is unknown what PNM will do to  rectify the capacity issues for Sandia Heights and North  Albuquerque Acres.    4   The GRIT April 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 4    FEBRUARY 2021 CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

We hope that by then we will be able  to have a person-to-person art tour. If need be, we can still do a virtual tour, but we hope we can do it in - person this year. We always enjoy doing these so if you are interested in participating call Kathleen at   263-5248 and give her your name and information. Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per  directions of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of every  other month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is  typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee)  as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a  September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with  15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time  of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
