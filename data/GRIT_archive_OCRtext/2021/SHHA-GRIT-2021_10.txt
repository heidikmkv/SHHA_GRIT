By Hugh Prather, CS&M Committee  As you read in August’s GRIT, wonderful things are happening in individual  units across Sandia Heights. The Community Service & Membership Commit- tee hopes to share those happenings through a series of short (<45 minutes)  Zoom webinars where we can share specific community-building practices.  We plan to host four webinars in October, December, February & April. In  the October one, we’ll talk about how to create your unit’s own “NextDoor”- type group designed specifically for your neighborhood using the free Google  Groups. We will demonstrate how to set up a small Google Group for your  unit. It’s easy, it’s free, and it builds stronger unit and Sandia Heights commu- nity. The CS&M Zoom webinar on “Building Your Own NextDoor” is sched- uled for Thursday, October 21, at 7:00 PM. To attend, call or email the office.  The December, February, and April webinar subjects are open at this time,  and we’d love your input! Has your unit done something together that built a  stronger sense of community? Maybe someone has put together a “Little  Free Library” that your unit is using and would like to share how it was done.  Maybe your unit has a monthly wine and cheese gathering where neighbor- hood happenings are shared and community is strengthened. These are the  kinds of ideas we are looking to highlight and share. Send your ideas for the  remaining webinars to thegritshha@gmail.com          * reprinted with permission  2   The GRIT – October 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 10  Domingo Baca, a Familiar Name in ABQ, Stems  From Unconventional, Prominent Family  By Elaine D. Briseño, ABQ Journal staff writer*    Spending time in the Northeast Heights almost guaran- tees an encounter with the name Domingo Baca. It’s  hard to miss. There’s a popular public park named after  him, a community center, a canyon and a well-used hik- ing trail in the Sandia Foothills.  Knowing the man behind the name isn’t as easy.   “Maldonado Journey to the Kingdom of New Mex- ico: Volume X” by Gilbert Maldonado says Baca, also  known as Diego Domingo Baca, was a prominent  rancher and sheepherder whose livestock roamed the  Sandia Foothills in the early and mid 1700s. It was this,  Maldonado claims, and his ties to a powerful family that  led to the canyon near there being named after him, and  subsequently North Domingo Baca Park and the North  Domingo Baca Multi-Generational Center, which were  named  after  a  nearby dam of the  same name. (The  dam  name  was  changed to Kinney  Dam in 2002 to  honor former Al- buquerque mayor  Harry Kinney.)  To understand why his name is probably so fre- quently displayed in the Albuquerque area, one must  understand Baca’s heritage. His tale is defined by the  lives of powerful and connected women.  Baca hails from a distinguished family who helped  settle Albuquerque and descended from Spanish colo- nizers. He also had a mother who defied social norms  but thrived despite it. Baca was the third child of Josefa  Baca. He was born in 1710 in Pajarito, which is now a  community in the South Valley. Josefa Baca, who lived  from 1685–1746, was a wealthy rancher and the de- scendant of Captain Cristóbal Baca, who brought the  Baca name to New Mexico from Mexico City in 1600.  Josefa Baca owned the Pajarito Land Grant. What  was unusual is that all of her children, including Do- mingo Baca, were illegitimate. According to her will, she  never married. The father, or fathers, of her children re- main a mystery but her unwed status did not keep her  or her children from remaining in good social standing.  Josefa Baca’s family ties and wealth may have played  a role in that, but the following tale by Fray Angélico  Chávez suggests it was Josefa Baca’s cleverness and au- dacity that allowed her—a woman with six illegitimate  children—and her children to remain respectable and  prominent members of society.  Fray Chávez was a Franciscan priest who died in 1996  and dedicated his life to researching and writing about  the origins of New Mexico families. Chávez recalls how  Josefa Baca helped her niece marry the man she loved,  even though the girl’s father threatened to kill her with  his own sword if she did. He shipped the niece off to live  with Josefa Baca in an effort to separate her from her  paramour. That turned out to be a mistake.  “Although Don Antonio Baca knew his sister Josefa  well, he had not reckoned with her strong-willed nature,  much less with her own views on love problems such as  the one he was thrusting upon her,” Chávez writes.  “Alone and unmarried, she had developed her inher- itance into a prosperous hacienda and had borne and  reared six healthy children besides.”  Baca took her niece to Mass at San Felipe de Neri  Church in Old Town one day. What nobody knew was  that hiding in the back of the church, behind a door, was  the niece’s beau. After the Mass, Baca and her niece al- lowed everyone to leave. The man came out of hiding  and the couple rushed to the altar where the priest was  waiting. The two were married without any objections.  Josefa Baca was the mastermind behind the entire plot,  contacting the groom and the priest prior to the Mass  but not informing her brother about what was about to  happen. I reckon it’s not all that surprising that her chil- dren became prosperous citizens.  Domingo Baca’s marriage in 1764 to second wife, Ma- ría Antonia Montoya, further bolstered his place among  New Mexico royalty. The marriage fused the branches  of two powerful New Mexico families.  Montoya was the great-granddaughter of the power- ful Captain Diego de Montoya. It was Captain Montoya  who once owned much of the land that is now the east  side of Albuquerque and the Sandia Foothills. Montoya  gave a large portion of the land to Elena Gallegos, who  also holds an important place in local history.  The union between Domingo Baca and María Antonia  Montoya resulted in the birth of Bartolomé Baca who  was governor of New Mexico province from 1823 to  1825. He was also the owner of the 1.28 million-acre land  grant in Estancia.  Although few details are available about Domingo  Baca’s life, I think his heritage speaks volumes. Every  time I pass that park or hike the canyon named after  him, I’m going to think about his mom, Josefa Baca. A  fierce woman who dismissed the expectations of her  gender and gave life to a family still thriving today.

You will see obvious and specific violations of the  Covenants and the ACC Design Guidelines. Some of the  most frequent are the most flagrant. For example,  residents often landscape using prohibited invasive  species. In a few years, ‘volunteers’ will be coming up  on adjacent properties. There are many fences  constructed with the ugly side out visible to all the  neighbors, (builders refer to the “Friendly” side and the  “Rude” side for a reason). Some stucco colors are far  outside the permitted color pallet on display in the  SHHA office. Sandia Heights requires setbacks from  property lines for both appearance and wildlife  passage, but unapproved structures are often built in  these areas.  Failure to submit a request for approval to the ACC  prior to initiating any exterior project is itself a covenant  violation. ACC approval is required prior to any exterior  alterations to a residence. Note that an existing  violation, such as a prohibited stucco color, may not be  automatically approved in subsequent work. This  approval process is specified by the Covenants for all  units in Sandia Heights. The forms are available on the  SHHA website and at the Office. Most residents are  cooperative  and  respectful  of  the  community  restrictions but, unfortunately, some consistently  ignore and violate the rules.  The original charter for Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association did not specify penalties for breaches and,  therefore, historically no real consequences resulted.  The ACC has frequently faced an untenable position  when receiving a complaint from a resident regarding a  neighbor who is in clear violation of one or more specific  guidelines. Too often we have had to admit that there is  little in our arsenal to enforce compliance. In a few  instances, the complaining residents have even  threatened to sue the ACC for its inaction. This situation  is now being remedied to bring SHHA, together with the  Covenants and ACC Guidelines, more in step with other  HOAs that possess enforcement authority and tools.  With guidance from our attorney, we are taking steps  to imbue the ACC Guidelines with legal standing equal  to the Covenants, which will allow expedited and  effective use of lawsuits and the court system to  enforce compliance. This process is already underway  and will have tangible effect very soon.  While there is little that can be done retroactively to  rectify existing violations, hopefully the increased risk  of legal ramifications will help deter future scofflaws.  The Sandia Heights Covenants and ACC Design  Guidelines are in place to benefit the entire  development, and with increased credibility will be a  more effective, positive influence on our community.     Procedures for Property Owners to  Amend Their Unit Covenants  By Bob Thomas, CSC Chair    The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA)  cannot modify or change any unit covenants. Any  covenant changes or modifications can only be done by  the property owners within their individual unit. SHHA  recognizes the rights of property owners to amend the  covenants of their units in accordance with procedures  set forth in the covenants of each unit. SHHA has  developed information to facilitate that process and to  ensure that a proposed amendment is in agreement  with established covenants. To avoid potential conflicts  with the existing covenants, we suggest that the  proposed amendment(s) be presented to the SHHA  Board of Directors for review prior to initiating a  petition signature effort.  The information and steps to initiate a covenant  amendment are available on the home page of the  SHHA website or at the following link:   https://www.sandiahomeowners.org/notices-and- information/notices-and-information/15986- procedures-for-property-owners-to-amend-their-unit- covenants. A copy may also be obtained from the SHHA  office.    Monthly Fun Fact    Albuquerque’s listed elevation of 5,314 feet makes it the  highest metropolitan city in the United States. Denver is  only a mile high. The Rio Grande through Albuquerque  is the low point (well, line) at about 4,900 feet. Our  homes  in  Sandia Heights  are all higher  than 6,000 feet  elevation. The  Sandia  Peak  Tram’s  base  house  is  at  6,559 feet.    4   The GRIT October 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 10      AUGUST CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

But invasive plants and trees  usually have these characteristics: they come from  somewhere else originally, have lots of seeds, don’t  have a lot of predators, spread easily via multiple  means, thrive on disturbed soils/ecosystems, and inhibit  the other plant life around them. A hypercompetitive  species turned loose on a setting that has poor de- fenses can result in overwhelmed local cultures. (Kinda  like us humans, but let’s not go there). Many times, they  were introduced on purpose to address a problem, and  many times they have some benefits—like the Siberian  Elm. Some can even be found for sale still (such as at our  Albertson’s this past summer) even though prohibited  in SH.   https://www.thinktreesnm.org/wp-content/up- loads/2017-WRIGHT-Why-Is-Siberian-Elm-in-NM.pdf   Basically, these species upset nature’s balance. It’s  up to us to help restore or manage the balance. The list  of “what’s bad” varies by the source, but invasive plants  in general reduce local biodiversity, lower water/soil  quality, and/or lessen recreation/cultural opportunities.  Having seen how kudzu has taken over portions of the  South, zebra mussels many lakes, and tamarisk/salt ce- dar our rivers in the West, the “new guys” can be a real  threat. Again, the key word is “balance.”  Another place we don’t want plants “invading” is  overhanging and obstructing the streets and walking  space. It is the homeowner’s responsibility to maintain  their yard, even in the setback up to the street edge.  County regulations can result in fines in some cases, per- haps even liability according to some. You may not mind  a specific plant but your neighbors and folks walking by  may. We ask you to manage your  yard and consider how we can  improve the environment we  live in and share, and not let  these plants get out of hand.   Most common invasive spe- cies  in  New  Mexico/Sandia  Heights, are listed at:  www.nmda.nmsu.edu/wp-con- tent/uploads/2016/11/Weed-List- memo-and-week-list-2016.pdf.  They can also be seen at  https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/terrestrial/plants.  Not sure what plant you are looking at? Of course,  there’s an app for that: PictureThis. Try it. (Machines get  smarter all the time, and I’m worrying about plants…)  Trees: It’s best to catch troublesome species early  before  they  become  large. Russian olive, salt  cedar/tamarisk,  Sibe- rian/Chinese elms, Tree  of Heaven, and even  Ponderosa pines and  cottonwoods  are  all  considered  problem  trees by some lists, as  they grow and spread  quickly. On the positive  side, in the right spot  and well managed they  can  provide  great  shade—like the cotton- woods in Silver Cloud  Park. Out of control, you  get root problems or  tree thickets you can’t  even walk through. See:   smithsonianmag.com/  science-nature/how-we- created-monster-ameri- can-southwest- 180956878  Plants: There are many invasive ones, but here we’ll  focus on thistles, tumbleweeds, and nightshade.  Thistles (Scotch, milk, musk, etc.) have purple flow- ers, mainly. This is another weed with some benefits— bees love it, some claim medicinal uses, and some eat it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thistle. It can explode  without management though.  Tumbleweed (Kali tragus, also called Russian thistle).  Hard to eliminate, and will take over if you let it. Pull it  before it starts a-rolling. No redeeming features other  than misplaced Western film nostalgia…and a real fire  hazard.    Needs a trim. Can you see  the UPS truck? Or vice  versa?    Russian olive.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year,  call Rene Kessel at (505) 504-3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.

We are accepting your entries for our annual photo contest for the Sandia  Heights 2022 Resident Guide & Directory. Submissions are due to the SHHA  office by Friday, November 5, 2021. If you are the lucky winner, your photo  will be featured on the cover of the 2022 Resident Guide and Directory, and  you will be acknowledged as the photographer.       Submission criteria are as follows:  •  You must be a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association and you must be an amateur photographer.  • Photos must be related to the Sandia Heights area (see the 2021 and earlier Directories).  • Photos must fit reasonably on the cover without loss of the composition.  • Photos must be in color and may be submitted digitally to shha@sandiahomeowners.org or as a hardcopy  print to the office. All hardcopy entries may be picked up at the office once the Directory is published.  • The resident must submit a statement that the photograph is an original taken by the homeowner, that  they are not a professional photographer (in business as a photographer), and that they grant permission  to SHHA to use their photo(s) in the Directory or on the SHHA website.    And While on the Subject of the Directory…  Take a look at your entry in The Resident’s Guide and Directory for 2021 and see if you want any changes to it for  2022. There are two places to look: under your last name and by your street address. Ideally, they are the same  information. If not, or if you want different information, please notify the SHHA office by Friday, November 5.   If you are a new resident in 2021, you should check with the office to see if the information to be published is  what you want. You have a choice of being identified, or of just being “Resident” in the address part of the  Directory with or without a phone number and without being in the by-name section. You can also be named,  but not have your phone number provided. Check with the office if you have any questions.    SH Tips & Hacks  As of going to press, it’s still pretty hot out. One way to keep the interior of you home cooler is to minimize the  “solar loading” from your windows. All that means is to keep the shades or curtains closed on the windows the  sun is shining on. To stay on top of solar loading, you need to be aware of where the sun is and where it will be  in the near future. So, mornings, keep east window shades drawn. Mid-day, the south-facing windows should  be blocked. Then in the afternoon, keep the west windows darkened. You’ll be amazed at how much cooler  your house is and how much less cooling you need to keep your house comfortable. In the winter, do just the  opposite. Keep the shades open on the windows with sunshine on them for some free heating.
