The Board approved 2020  Budget estimated Gross Income of $221,157.73. Ex- penses of $219,783.29 and Other Expenses of $930.00,  resulting in a Net Income of $444.44.  As stated at the time the 2020 Budget was ap- proved, these are projections which may change dur- ing the year and have changed. The final financial re- ports show Gross Income of $220,191.14, Expenses of  $208,066.61 and Other Expenses of $1995.53, resulting  in a Net Income of $10,129.00. The major difference be- tween budgeted and actual amounts were the pur- chase of only four tram tickets for 2021 and no lease  payments for six months. In addition, all Committee  Chairs managed their budgets, which resulted in cost  savings.  2021 Budget. After reviewing the proposed budget at  its October 14, 2020, meeting, the Board approved the  budget as proposed by the Finance Committee. The Fi- nance Committee developed the budget based on cur- rent and projected reserves and the revenues needed  to cover the services needed by property owners.  This allows for a reasonable targeted Net Income of  approximately $2,710.20.  Each year income and expenses will be reviewed to  establish the best course of actions for the following  years.  Budgets are projections which may change as the  year progresses, so please go to the Finance tab on the  Board section of the SHHA website for current details.  Internal Reviews. Each year members of the Finance  Committee review the major financial procedures to  ensure they are being followed.  This past year members reviewed payroll, Quick- Books, dues, petty cash, advertising, Tram passes,  health insurance and security. While there were no ma- jor issues noted, several needed improvements were  identified, especially in the area of security. Security  processes were updated to reflect changes required  due to the amount of data being backed up.  Based on the reviews, the required annual report  was prepared and submitted to the Executive Commit- tee for review and acceptance by the President.  3   The GRIT – March 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 3    Continued on page 7…       2021 Annual Meeting Reports   of Standing Committees    Architectural Control Committee (ACC)  Members:  Bob Bower, Chair  David Crossley  Michael Pierce  Robert Hare  Emily Rudin  Cheryl Iverson  Randy Trip   Craig Newbill (resigned July 2020)  The year 2020 was similar to ACC activities in 2019. A  total of 319 applications were processed, which is a  slight decrease from the 327 approvals in 2019. The  ACC continued to work with the County on new devel- opments in the community. These include the North  Tramway Estates (NTE), the Hawk’s Landing,  and the  Unit 16 Las Pradas Subdivision developments. Most of  the 14 building sites in the NTE subdivision have been  sold. The Hawk’s Landing (33 residences) and Las Pra- das (8 residences) projects started construction of  their planned residential units in 2019. The ACC also at- tended meetings of the County Zoning Administrator,  Planning Commission, and the Board of County Com- missioners on requests for zoning changes and other  issues that could impact the residential properties  within Sandia Heights, and on zoning requests for  commercial ventures within the immediate vicinity of  the community.  In 2020, as has been done in prior years, the ACC  submitted articles for publication in The GRIT newslet- ter that are also posted on the SHHA website and will  continue to do so in 2021. It is hoped that these articles   4   The GRIT March 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 3      January CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

Summary of Activities for 2020:   • The total Association membership for 2020 stands at  83% of 2,220 households in Sandia Heights which is 2%  higher than 2019.   • With COVID-19, the Tram usage was the lowest it has  been since we started tracking usage in 2009. In  2020, 1033 Tram Passes were used and 1375 were un- used (44% usage rate).     Covenant Support Committee (CSC)  Members:   Bob Thomas, Chair   Bob Bower, ACC liaison   Joyce Harkwell   Stephen Baca   Pamela Mitchell   Judy Chreist   Patricia Moody   Stan Davis   Randy Tripp  Functions: Sandia Heights has Use Restrictions (Cove- nants) governed by over 38 sets of Covenants, each ap- plying to a designated Unit within the community. The  CSC works with property owners to enforce these le- gally binding documents. CSC provides covenant en- forcement through a formalized process.   Many of the covenants were written in 1960–1970  and do not specifically address some issues we face to- day. For some complaints, the unit covenants do not  cover or address the alleged violation and there is noth- ing the CSC can do to help. We are bound by what your  covenants permit. Only the homeowners in a specific  unit can change their covenants. The SHHA webpage of- fers guidance on how to change your unit covenants.   In some situations, Bernalillo County zoning Codes  and Ordinances are more restrictive than the SHHA cov- enants, such as for outdoor lighting, barking dogs, and  trash. In these instances, we encourage the home- owner to file a complaint with the County. The SHHA of- fice staff can offer guidance on contacting the County.   The CSC meets the first Tuesday of every month at  6:00 PM in the office conference room. Due to COVID-19,  most CSC meetings in 2020 were conducted via Zoom.   Homeowners with questions or a statement to make  are allotted five minutes at the beginning of each meet- ing. Then the doors close to maintain confidentiality of  CSC business. With a Zoom meeting, the homeowner  must sign off. If you plan to speak at a meeting, please  notify the SHHA office beforehand. The CSC Agenda  and Minutes are for internal distribution only.  Summary of Activities for 2020. There were fifty-two  complaints handled by the CSC in 2020, including five  carried over from 2019. This was an increase of 136%  over the previous year. All were investigated by CSC  members and recommendations were made as to the  validity of the complaints with regard to the covenants  in their particular units. Of these, forty-six were closed  in 2020. One complaint has required the SHHA attorney  and this complaint is carried over to 2021.  2020 Successes. It was an unusual year in that so  many covenant complaints were filed. Committee mem- bers took on many more cases last year than they nor- mally would, and consequently they put in an extraordi- nary amount of voluntary time. Committee members  did not make in-person contact with complainants or  suspected violators; all communication was by phone or  email. A further complication was that CSC meetings  were conducted virtually. However, in these COVID-19  times, all complaints filed with the SHHA office and han- dled by the CSC were thoroughly investigated.  9  The GRIT – March 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 3 10  The GRIT – March 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 3 11   The GRIT – March 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 3  Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups is sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per  directions of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of every  other month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is  typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee)  as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a  September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with  15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time  of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.

Summary of activities for 2020:  • In April and October, the committee fulfilled our  twice-per-year obligation to the New Mexico  Highway Department of leading a “trash clean-up  detail” of Tramway Blvd. between mile markers 8  and 9 (from the intersection of Paseo del Norte &  Tramway Blvd., south to Simms Park Road).  Participants have consisted of Board members and  volunteers from within the community. Thank you!   • Unfortunately, the scheduled March 14, 2020, “Crime  Risk Management Seminar” in conjunction with  BCSO and Sandia Heights Security was canceled due  to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the  context of that event was published in the July issue  of The GRIT, “Common Sense & Do It Yourself:  Reduce Opportunity for Home Theft and Vandalism.”  • There were 16 articles published in the GRIT during  2020 that were pertinent to the objectives of P&S  Committee. Nine of them were specific to crime, fire,  and safety; another three gave guidance on living  with community varmints; and the remaining four  were non-specific in nature.  • Worked with Bernalillo County Parks &  Recreation to resolve potential removal of  trees from the Little Cloud Park due to  exposed roots as a safety issue.
