SHHA dues are substantially less than other HOA neighbor- hoods in Albuquerque. We enjoy a variety of benefits for a minimal sum.  However, operating expenses—such as rent, utilities, labor, printing, post- age, insurance and legal costs—have risen significantly.  Due to these increased costs, we find it necessary to raise monthly  dues. Effective April 1, 2022, SHHA membership dues will increase  from $8.50 to $9.00 per month.  Tram Pass Availability & Pricing. During the pandemic the number of Tram  passes available was 4 per day, and they consistently sold out with lead  times running as much as 3 weeks. Effective January 1, 2022, the number of  passes available will be raised to the pre-pandemic level of 8 per day, and  the rate will increase from $7.00 to $7.50 per pass—still a bargain over the  $29 non-SHHA member rate. With 8 tickets per day, lead times should be  minimal for all but the highest-traffic dates. You can see if tickets are still  available for your date on the SHHA website. Then, come and get em!  2022 Annual Meeting  The 2022 Sandia Heights Homeowners Association annual meeting will be  held on Saturday, February 19. Attendance will be virtual via Zoom. Stay  tuned for a detailed agenda in next month’s GRIT. One of the agenda items  will be election by the membership of a new Board member (see below),  per Bylaws section 6.5, which requires a short biography of the candidate  to be published 2 months prior to the meeting.  Board Member Candidate  Susan McCasland, Nominating Committee Chair  Kathleen McCaughey is a candidate for the SHHA Board of Directors. Ms.  McCaughey has chaired the Sandia Heights Artists for the past three years.  She was a mechanical engineer and manager at Sandia National Laborato- ries for over 30 years. Prior to moving to Sandia Heights about 7 years ago,  she was a resident in North Albuquerque Acres for 18 years and, therefore,  understands very well the worth of a strong homeowners’ association. She  will bring her leadership, strategic planning, financial planning, and process  skills to the SHHA Board if elected by you, our members.  2   The GRIT – December 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 12  Trash Bins Are an Eyesore!  Covenant Support Committee    It seems that many residents are leaving their bins ei- ther on the roadside or next to their homes where they  are visible to neighbors and passersby. We would like to  remind everyone that improper storage of trash bins is  a violation of all our Sandia Heights Covenants which  state, in general, “Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed from public  view….” Please, when your trash and recyclables have  been collected, return your bins to storage out of public  view. Simply parking trash bins beside the garage is not  acceptable. They must be hidden from street view.  We would like to remind all residents that trash (in- cluding recycling) must be out no later than 7AM on the  scheduled pickup day, and no earlier than 5PM on the  evening prior to collection. In addition, if you have edi- ble garbage in the bin, please don’t put the bin out over- night. We don’t want our bear friends to find it. First  thing in the morning is better when bears are not hiber- nating. Thanks for helping keep Sandia Heights a beau- tiful place for all of us to live.      Does your house look like this? If so, you are in violation of San- dia Heights covenants. Please store your garbage cans in your  garage or behind an attractive enclosure. Together, let’s keep  Sandia Heights beautiful !        Non-members Are Bound by Covenants  Architectural Control Committee    Some Sandia Heights residents who are not members of  the SHHA seem to think that this status excuses them  from following their unit’s covenants. This is absolutely  not the case. All residents are bound by their covenants.  No exceptions; no exemptions.     SHHA Key Tags, Anyone?  Elizabeth Edgren, Chair,   Community Service & Membership Committee    Do you have a SHHA Member key tag? Do you know  what it’s for? If you don’t have one, do you know how  to get one?  When we move in to Sandia Heights, our Office staff  mails us a big, white envelope containing several im- portant documents. One of them is a multi-purpose  form on which we (1) ensure our info is correct for the  SHHA Directory, (2) learn how to receive a member ben- efits key tag, and (3) sign up to receive email alerts, in- cluding notice of the monthly GRIT community newslet- ter. If we never return this form in item (2), we don’t re- ceive key tags.  What’s the key tag for? In each month’s GRIT, usually  on p. 4, as well as on the SHHA website, we see a listing  of “Participating Merchants.” These are not just adver- tisers, but are businesses that offer specific discounts  for SHHA Members. To receive these deals, we show  our key tag to the Merchant. No key tag. No discount.  If you can’t find your key tag, or don’t think you ever  got one, call or go by the Office. Betsy and Teresa can  verify your membership and your contact info—and  your communication preference for The GRIT and other  alerts—and give you a fresh, new key tag. Then you can  enjoy the special offers from our Participating Mer- chants!      3   The GRIT – December 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 12    Procedures for Attendance   of Guests at SHHA Board   and Committee Meetings  Roger Hagengruber, President    1. Any member of SHHA is entitled to attend committee  or board meetings.   2. However, if planning to attend, the SHHA member  must let the SHHA Office or host (e.g., committee  chair) know of their desire to attend at least one day  ahead of the meeting.  3. If the member plans to make a statement, they must  notify the host when asking to attend. The procedure  for statements is that the member has 5 minutes at  the beginning of the meeting to make their state- ment and the Board or committee members are al- lowed up to 5 minutes to seek clarification, if needed,  of the guest’s statement. Discussion of the state- ment is done in executive session where only Board  or committee members are allowed.  4. Committee Chairs and the Board chairperson can  place the meeting in executive session as appropri- ate and guests must leave the meeting for such exec- utive sessions. Please note that much of the commit- tee work of the Architectural Control Committee and  Covenant Support Committee are conducted in exec- utive session.  5. The process for SHHA members attending meetings  as guests is to place the guests in a “Waiting Room”  either a physical one (when we are having an in-per- son meeting at the SHHA office) or a virtual one dur- ing a Zoom online meeting. Once their status as an  SHHA member is confirmed, the guests are allowed  to enter the meeting with the permission of the Host.  Please Don’t Feed Our Deer    There are a number of reasons why we should not feed  the deer in our neighborhood. Many of us love seeing  them near our homes, but it is not good for the deer, or  for us, to feed them.   New Mexico Fish and Game’s website mentions that  our mule deer have difficulty digesting non-natural  foods such as grain, hay, vegetables, fruits, or pet food  and can die with full stomachs. It is also unlawful in New  Mexico for anyone to cause a nuisance game-animal  problem by baiting, feeding, or otherwise enticing  game animals to an area.   As if that weren’t enough, a recent article in the New  York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/sci- ence/deer-covid-infection.html) points out that up to  80% of the white-tailed deer sampled in Iowa from April  2020 through January 2021 were infected with corona- virus. Though it appears that the deer were infected  with the SARS-CoV-2 by humans, there is no evidence  that deer have passed the virus back to humans…yet.  “If deer can transmit the virus to humans, it’s a game  changer,” said Tony Goldberg, a veterinarian at the Univer- sity of Wisconsin-Madison who studies the evolution of in- fectious diseases as they jump between animals and peo- ple. “To have a wildlife species become a reservoir after  transmission from humans is very rare and unlucky, as if we  needed more bad luck.”   Later in the article, Rachel Ruden, Iowa’s state wild- life veterinarian, cautions that the virus can spread when  people feed deer in their backyard, [emphasis added]  through sewage discharges or maybe when an animal  licks a splotch of chewing tobacco left behind by an in- fected hunter. Several states are advising deer hunters  to take precautions. Eating cooked venison carries little  risk, though, as long as the meat reaches an internal  temperature of 165°F.

But there are many more. Here’s a short  description of several. Do you know of others?  Hanukkah (Jewish). This year Hanukkah, or Chanukah, starts at nightfall on November 28 and ends with  nightfall on December 6. It is an 8-day Jewish festival marking the miraculous victory of the Maccabees,  Jewish freedom fighters, over the Seleucid Greek occupiers in the year 139 BCE. After recapturing Jerusa- lem’s Holy Temple, which had been converted into a place of idol worship, they searched for pure oil with  which to light the Temple menorah. They found just enough to burn for one day, but miraculously it burned  for eight days until more oil could be brought.  Saint Nicholas Day (Christian) December 6. This holiday honors the birth of Saint Nicholas, the saint who serves as a role  model for gift-giving and is commonly known as Santa Claus.  Rohatsu or Bodhi Day (Buddhist) December 8. Rohatsu celebrates the historical Buddha’s decision and vow to sit under  the Bodhi tree until he reached spiritual enlightenment. It is celebrated through meditation.  Immaculate Conception (Catholic) December 8. Leading-up to Jesus’ birthday celebration on Christmas, Catholics celebrate  the day of Immaculate Conception to honor his mother Mary, who they say was preserved from original sin for her entire life.  Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe (Catholic) December 12. A holiday celebrated by Mexicans and Americans of Mexican  descent that honors the appearance of the Virgin Mary in Mexico City.  Posadas Navideñas (Christian) December 16–24. Primarily a Hispanic Christian holiday that commemorates Mary and Jo- seph’s journey to Bethlehem to give birth to Jesus.  Winter Solstice (Wicca/Pagan) December 21 (8:59 AM Mountain Time in 2021). Winter sol- stice is when the northern hemisphere is most inclined away from the sun. Pagans and Wicca  believers will celebrate that event through Yule, in which believers also honor the winter-born  king, symbolized by the rebirth of the sun.  Christmas (Christian) December 25. Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. Many  Christians will attend church, have family parties, decorate a tree, and exchange gifts.  Zarathosht-no-Diso (Death of the Prophet Zarathustra) (Zoroastrianism) December 26. Un- like many of the other holidays in the month, Zoroastrians honor the death of their prophet,  Zarathustra, who founded Zoroastrianism, one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions.  Boxing Day (British Commonwealth countries) December 26. Boxing Day has nothing to do with prize fighting, getting rid  of empty Christmas boxes, or returning unwanted presents to stores. The holiday originated in the United Kingdom during  the Middle Ages. It was the day when the alms boxes, a collection box for the poor often kept in churches, were opened and  their contents distributed. It was also the day servants were traditionally given off to celebrate Christmas with their families.  Feast of the Holy Family (Catholic) December 27. Catholics use this day to honor Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.  Holy Innocents Day (Christian) December 28. This day solemnly honors the deaths of children killed by King Herod, who  was attempting to kill Jesus.  Kwanzaa (principally African American) December 26 through January 1. Kwanzaa was cre- ated by Dr. Maulana Karenga in 1966 after the Watts riots in Los Angeles. The name Kwanzaa  comes from the phrase “matunda ya kwanza” which means “first fruits” in Swahili. Each fam- ily celebrates Kwanzaa in its own way, but celebrations often include songs and dances, Afri- can drums, storytelling, poetry reading, and a large traditional meal. On each of the seven  nights, families gather and a child lights one of the candles on the Kinara, then one of the  seven principles, values of African culture, is discussed.  Watch Night (Christian) December 31. For Watch Night, Christians thank God for the safety they received during the year.  New Year’s Eve (widely celebrated) December 31. Civilizations around the world have been celebrating the start of each  new year for at least four millennia. Today, most New Year’s festivities begin on December 31 (New Year’s Eve), the last day  of the Gregorian calendar, and continue into the early hours of January 1 (New Year’s Day). Common traditions include attend- ing parties, eating special New Year’s foods, making resolutions for the new year, and watching fireworks displays.  Ōmisoka (Japan) December 31. Families gather on Ōmisoka for one last time in the old year  to have a bowl of toshikoshi-soba or toshikoshi-udon, a tradition based on eating the long  noodles to cross over from one year to the next. At midnight, many visit shrines or temples.  Shinto shrines prepare amazake (fermented rice drink) to pass out to crowds and most Bud- dhist temples have large cast bells that are struck once for each of the 108 earthly desires  believed to cause human suffering.            8   The GRIT – December 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 12  ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  80 Juniper Hill Place – Remove/Replace Front Entry  Door  347 Paintbrush Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  358 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Replace Windows & Doors  429 Live Oak Lane – Paint Gate/Garage Door/Vigas  528 Live Oak Place – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Panels  Installation  651 Cougar Loop – Garage Addition  793-C Tramway Lane Court - Reroof  933 Bobcat Blvd. – Roof and Color Coat Repair   1111 San Rafael Avenue – Fence Installation  1221 Rockrose Road – Repair Stucco, Paint Trim and Mis- cellaneous  1456 Bluebell Drive – Landscaping   1517 Eagle Ridge Terrace – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panels Installation   1539 Eagle Ridge Place – Landscaping   1564 Eagle Ridge Court – Replace Windows and Re- Stucco  1565 Eagle Ridge Court – Addition of Parking Pad  1709 Quail Run Court – Replace Latilla Fence  1849 Tramway Terrace Loop – Addition of Two Windows  1856 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Gates   1872 San Bernardino – Replace Windows and Reroof  2025 Quail Run Drive – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic Pan- els Installation  2301 Calle de Rafael – Replace Railroad Tie Edging of  Driveway with Brick  2434 Tramway Terrace Court – Fence Replacement   2768 Wolfberry Place – Replace Exterior Doors  2815 Tramway Circle – Replace Kitchen Window  2833 Tramway Circle – Repair Roof, Replace Swamp  Cooler, and Replace & Repaint Garage Header  2893 Tramway Place - Hardscape       Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read       about all projects currently under ACC management.   Monthly Fun Fact    Albuquerque is famous for its unique Christmas lights.  Although electric versions are sometimes used, tradi- tional decorations consist of small brown paper sacks  with a layer of sand for ballast and a candle for lighting.  Dozens placed along a path are quite striking. There is an  ongoing dispute about what these decorations are  called. In this author’s observation, south of roughly La  Bajada (the escarpment northeast of Cochiti) and in Ari- zona the term is luminaria. North of La Bajada, it is faro- lito. Though this is sometimes passionately debated, it  really does seem to be just a difference in regional dia- lect. Think chick peas (New York) vs. garbanzo beans  (New Mexico).            9  The GRIT – December 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 12 10  The GRIT – December 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 12 11   The GRIT December 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 12  Community Events Bulletin Board      This group is not sponsored by SHHA.

We gather in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8  people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees  contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food  and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group  dinners during the year. All adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome.
