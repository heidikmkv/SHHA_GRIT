The SHHA  Board’s Community Service & Membership (CS&M) Committee is working  on ways to welcome our new residents now that things are beginning to  get back to normal.   More important, though, are any efforts nearby neighbors make to wel- come new homeowners and tenants to the neighborhood and to establish  positive relationships with them. There is no better time to meet someone  than during the first weeks after they move in, but it’s never too late to  strike up a conversation and get to know them. Many of us find we have  much in common with our new neighbors, and find good friendships begin  in these first conversations.  Welcoming your neighbors benefits both of you:  1) Crime prevention – The best crime prevention is a good, aware neighbor.   2) Social connections – Who knows who might become your new close  friends?  3) Positive resolution of issues and problems – It’s a lot easier to talk about  barking dogs or bothersome lights if you’ve met previously in a friendly set- ting.   4) Mutual support and cooperation – You may not want to lend them your  tools, but maybe that neighbor has expertise in an area you don’t, or could  benefit from your expertise. Maybe you can check on each other’s homes  while the other is away.   If conversation with strangers is  way outside your comfort zone,  here’s a good opener: “Did you hear  about _____?” Being helpful fosters  a culture of helpfulness. Just remem- ber the old advice: politics, religion,  and money are off limits—at least at  first. For the curmudgeons: If noth- ing else, you may find out they’re as  cranky as you are!  The point is, be the neighbor you  wish you had, and Sandia Heights will  be a better place for us all to live.     2   The GRIT – August 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 8  Welcome, Teresa!    Let’s give a warm welcome to Teresa Gonzales, the  new office administrator at SHHA. Teresa knows San- dia Heights well as she is a resident here! Stop in some- time to say “hi” to Betsy and “welcome” to Teresa.    One Unit at a Time  By Hugh Prather, CS&M Committee member    Be honest! Don’t you have at least a smidgen of pride  when you respond to the question, “Where’s your  home?” and you answer, “Oh I live up by the tram,” or  “I’ve been living in Sandia Heights almost 15 years.”  Beautiful vistas, wildlife that is a never-ending source  of interest, and attractive and well maintained homes  all add to the appeal of Sandia Heights. And, at the  same time, we are a community made up of people  and, hence, neighbors.  An interesting observation holds very true about a  community like Sandia Heights that was master- planned with a long-range vision: our community is ei- ther improving—that is becoming more attractive, a  more pleasant place to live—or declining—becoming  less attractive and a less pleasant community in which  to live. There is no such thing as a “steady-state com- munity.”  The heart of any community isn’t the physical, or  natural environment, it’s the human environment.  With over 2,200 residences in Sandia Heights, that’s a  lot of human environment to get our heads around.  Bet there isn’t one of us residing here who could name  all 2,200 “neighbors.” On the other hand, the develop- ers of Sandia Heights built the entire, larger community  around the concept of discrete “units” as new subdivi- sions were planned and came online. Your unit is fun- damentally the first two digits of your house address  number—though not true for the earlier units; the first  units have a single digit representing their unit desig- nation.  These really do represent “neighborhoods.” Most  units are small enough that you can know most of your  neighbors and recognize them as being a part of your  community. Your Community Services and Member- ship (CS&M) Committee of the SHHA is focusing this  year on strengthening the sense of community in indi- vidual units.   Individual units have done an amazing number of  great things over the years that have enhanced their  sense of community, brought people together, and  made their neighborhood a more pleasant place to live.  The CS&M Committee will be exploring creative ways  to share these “great things” over the year ahead and  would invite you to become part of the process of that  sharing and community building.  CS&M meets once a month at the SHHA office from  9:30 AM to 10:30 AM. Please call the SHHA Office or  email thegritshha@gmail.com to find out more or to  visit a committee meeting and possibly join us in build- ing a stronger community one unit at a time.    Respect Our Wildlife    One of the wonderful things about living in Sandia  Heights is our immersion in the native wildlife. But that  also comes with a need for caution. By definition, these  animals are wild and act wild. Please be aware of and  respect that wildness. In particular,  • Coyotes may look like dogs, but don’t be fooled.  They can and will attack and eat pets. We had an in- cident recently where a resident was out walking a  leashed dog when a coyote bit the dog.   • And it’s not just coyotes. Bobcats, mountain lions,  and great horned owls look at pets, small pets in par- ticular, as a nice meal. If you love your cat, make it  an indoor-only cat.  • Let’s not train bears to find food in our trash cans.  Unless it’s midwinter when the bears are asleep,  don’t roll your trash bins out until the morning of  collection. During the week, keep them shut away  from bears.  Enjoy our wildlife, and let’s respect the “wild” in  wildlife. We and they will get along better that way.      3   The GRIT – August 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 8    A Conversation with Sandia Heights Security  By Elizabeth Edgren, Chair, CS&M Committee    Who are those Security patrol folks driving around the  neighborhood, and what do they do? Sandia Heights Se- curity is a division of Sandia Heights Services, which also  provides our water and wastewater services, and our  refuse and recycling collection. They also provide secu- rity services to subscribers. (This is a subscription service,  that is separate from membership in the SHHA, and must  be initiated and paid for by each household that wants to  receive their services. In certain units’ covenants, security  subscription is mandatory, so be sure to read yours!)  I sent several questions to the Security folks which  John Shorey, Security Supervisor, very kindly answered.  Here are the highlights, edited for space.  How do you know who’s a subscriber and who’s not?  We use a program that keeps accurate records of mem- bers and tracks the number and types of calls received.  What difference would it make if every household in  Sandia Heights were a subscriber? Having 100% partici- pation would be great! Whenever an entire community  supports security efforts, it is a deterrent. It also allevi- ates our guards needing to check membership when re- sponding to calls and/or scheduling Special Watches.  What’s the most challenging thing about the job?  One of the more challenging aspects is dealing with in- dividuals who do not live in our area (mostly homeless  individuals), who we’ve received calls on. Unfortu- nately, the most we can do if we’re able to locate the  person is ask them to leave the area, but we cannot do  anything to ensure they comply other than follow/check  up on the person to encourage their progress out of the  area. Of course, depending on the situation, we offer to  contact a ride or family member for them and/or alert  medical personnel if the situation calls for that.  What’s the most frustrating thing about the job? Not  being notified by residents until hours or days after a sit- uation, such as a vehicle break-in or suspicious person.  If we’re notified quickly, we can see if our patrol can  make contact, pass information along to Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) if appropriate, and alert  our fellow guards to keep an eye out on their shifts.  What do you wish SH residents knew about your  job? That they are an integral part of our job; they are  our eyes and ears. For us to perform our jobs fully, we  need folks to speak up if they see something suspicious.  We encourage everyone not to hesitate to reach out  and let us know if they have concerns.  What would you like to see SH residents do to im- prove their own security? Getting and using alarms is a  great crime deterrent. We would also love to see resi- dents not leave valuables in their vehicles, and to lock  their vehicles. When leaving town, communicating with  security and trusted neighbors is a valuable tool! The  more eyes and ears we have looking out, the better!  Any particular story you’d like to share? One story  that stands out was when one of our residents who suf- fers from dementia wandered away from home. The  family called us, very concerned, and asked for our as- sistance searching for the person. After looking for sev- eral hours, we were able to locate the person and could  inform the family they were safe and in good health. Be- ing able to help a family in a situation like that, to pro- vide relief in such a stressful time, is very fulfilling and  one of the many things that make this such a great job!  What’s the most satisfying thing about your job? Be- ing able to provide services to help protect and assist  our residents. We look at Sandia Heights as our own lit- tle city and take pride in being able to help provide a  feeling of safety and comfort for our members knowing  there’s someone looking out for them.  What do you do with an alarm call? For members, our  guards respond and check the perimeter of the home  for signs of forced entry or suspicious activity. If there  are signs that someone may have gained access into the  home, our guards immediately call BCSO, and make con- tact with the homeowner and/or alarm company.  What is a “customer assist”? This can be a variety of  calls such as helping a member who needs a vehicle  jumpstarted, to helping members move pet carriers,  etc. to/from their vehicles after they’ve had surgery.  What do you do with a snake call? We do not man- date our guards respond to snake calls; we leave that to  their discretion. However, if a guard is comfortable re- sponding, they capture the snake and relocate it away  from homes. Otherwise, members should contact ani- mal control.  What do you do with a “threat/personal” call? The  caller is advised to contact BCSO to file a report, but we  also take down the information for our records and to  ensure all guards are aware of the situation and know  to keep an eye out.  What is a “utility assist”? Utility assists are associated  with after-hour calls our utility personnel receive, such  as a report of a leak in the road, or the need to have wa- ter turned off in case of an emergency leak. Our guards  will try to verify the report of a leak before the on-call  utility personnel arrive. These calls are rare and come  secondary to member calls.

Stormwater comes  from rain and snowmelt, and stormwater runoff is the  water we see in our streets and arroyos when it rains.  Pollutants, like oil and gas, trash, animal waste, fertiliz- ers, pesticides, and other chemicals, get picked up by  stormwater runoff and enter our storm drains, chan- nels, and arroyos, quickly making it into our waterways.  There are some easy ways you can help reduce pollution  in stormwater. These tips are especially relevant when  there is more stormwater runoff now during our mon- soon season, but applicable throughout the year.  Don’t Toss Out Household Hazardous Waste (HHW).  Automobile  fluids,  paints, old batteries,  pesticides, and other  household chemicals  should not be thrown  away with the rest of  your garbage. If taken to the landfill, these substances  can leach into our groundwater. And if left out or  dumped into streets, storm drains or arroyos, they can  make their way to the Rio Grande. This is both harmful  to people and the environment. Only stormwater  should go into storm drains!  If you have any HHW that you need to dispose of, res- idents of Bernalillo County can drop off HHW at the Haz- ardous Waste Collection Center four days a week at no  charge. The collection center is located at 6137 Edith  Blvd NE. For more information and details you can call  Advanced Chemical Transport (ACT) at 505-349-5220 or  visit their website, https://www.actenviro.com/. Addi- tionally, most automobile parts stores will accept up to  5 gallons a day of oil and automotive fluids. Proper dis- posal of HHW protects the health of our watershed.  The Right Way to Wash Your Car. Washing your car  improperly can harm our natural waterways. Dirt, heavy  metals,  gasoline,  and  cleaners are rinsed off  your car and travel from  your driveway to the  storm drains or arroyos,  and finally to our streams  and rivers. In order to  help prevent this pollu- tion, take your car(s) to a  local car washing business or follow these easy car  washing tips:  • Look for biodegradable soaps  • Wash your car over your yard or lawn to prevent run- off  • Don’t let rinse water run into the streets—only rain  in the drains!  • Use a bucket and rag, then dispose dirty water into  a sink or toilet    Time to Fertilize Your Yard, But Can It Be Harmful?  Using fertilizer is a great way to give nutrients to  grasses, plants, and trees. However, excessive fertilizer  doesn’t benefit plant growth. If plants are over ferti- lized, they won’t grow more, and instead stormwater  runoff from rain picks up excess fertilizers and pesti- cides and takes them to our streams and rivers. High  amounts of fertilizers in our river causes nutrient load- ing, leading to harmful algae blooms that remove oxy- gen from the water. This is harmful to native fish and  other aquatic animals. The best way to apply fertilizer is  to use only as recommended on the packaging. Keep  your plants healthy, while keeping the Rio Grande!

SH Tips & Hacks    This is the first of an occasional short piece on tips or  “life hacks” that may be useful for Sandia Heights resi- dents. This first one is on evaporative (“swamp”) cool- ers, so those of you with refrigerated air can skip on.  Here’s a way to get a bit more out of your swampers,  both in the turning-on and turning-off stage.  When you turn your swamp cooler on, the pads are  dry. So that initial bit of air you’re blowing in your house  is as hot as outside. Instead, first turn on only the water  pump for a few minutes to moisten the pads. Then turn  on the blower. Voilà! Cooler air right off the bat.  Now when you’re ready to turn off your swamper for  the night, don’t just switch it off. You’ve already soaked  the pads, and if you go directly to “off” that water is only  going to evaporate into the outside air. Instead, turn  your unit to fan/blower only (no water pump) for a few  minutes. You’ll get a bit more cool air as you dry out the  pads and use that water for its intended purpose.    Monthly Fun Fact    The San Felipe de Neri Church in Albuquerque’s Old  Town was built in 1793, with modifications in the 19th and  early 20th centuries. It replaced a 1706 church that col- lapsed during the winter of 1792-93. The current church  is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city and the  only building in Old Town proven to date to the Spanish  colonial period. It features seven-foot-thick walls. It has  remained in continuous use for over 225 years.     9  The GRIT – August 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 8 10  The GRIT – August 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 8 11   The GRIT – August 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 8  Community Events Bulletin Board      Neither of these groups is sponsored by SHHA.

September 25th and 26th, the  artists are planning an in-person tour again this year. Many of the 33 artists will be displaying their work  outdoors at various homes around Sandia Heights. A variety of media will be on display, from paintings to  ceramics, to jewelry, etc. Keep watching this space and https://www.sandiaheightsartists.com.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: We are happy to announce that Cork & Fork is resuming our  bimonthly dinners. The first one will be an outdoor potluck this month. We gather in the homes of our  members. Each small dinner group is typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. The host decides the menu  theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to some part of the meal—along with a wine  to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. Though most of the  dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, as is the one this month. All adult  Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time of year, call Rene Kessel at (505) 504- 3886 or email at rene.kessel@cblegacy.com.
