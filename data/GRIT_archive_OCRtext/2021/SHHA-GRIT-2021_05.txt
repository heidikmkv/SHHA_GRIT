Bathroom Water Conservation  • Don’t leave water running while brushing your teeth or shaving.  • Take short showers instead of tub baths; showers use less water.  • If taking a bath, plug the drain right away and adjust the temperature as  it fills.  • When washing your hands, turn off the water while you lather.  Kitchen Water Conservation  • Don’t use water to defrost frozen foods; thaw foods in the refrigerator  overnight.  • Scrape dishes rather than rinsing them before loading them into the  dishwasher.  • Compost food waste instead of using the garbage disposal or throwing  it in the trash. This is an especially good tip for those on a septic system,  as ground garbage fills up the holding tank quickly.  • Keep a container of drinking water in the refrigerator instead of letting  the faucet run until the water is cool.   Outdoors Water Conservation  • Purchase an inexpensive hose  timer to avoid over-watering.  • Collect rainwater to use on your  landscape.  • Use a broom or electric blower to  clean driveways and sidewalks ra- ther than hosing them off.  • When washing your car, use an  adjustable nozzle or sprayer and  turn off the water stream while  soaping your vehicle.     2   The GRIT – May 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 5  Special Election for Congress   on Tuesday, June 1  By George Richmond, SHHA resident    When Deb Haaland, our elected representative to Con- gress, resigned to become Secretary of the Department  of the Interior, her seat became vacant and so there will  be special election on Tuesday, June 1.  I urge all registered voters to learn about the six can- didates, including two write-in candidates, and vote, ei- ther in person—on election day, or during the early-vot- ing session the two weeks before the election—or via  mail, aka absentee.  Here is a timeline from the Office of the NM Secretary  of State:  May 4, 2021—28 days before the election.  • Voter Registration (by mail or online) closes. How- ever, qualified electors can use same-day registration  (SDR) to submit a new voter registration form, or up- date their existing registration at select early voting  and election day locations within their county of res- idence. For more information about the SDR loca- tions and hours of operation, please contact the  county clerk’s office.  • County clerks can begin mailing ballots to voters who  have requested an absentee ballot (in a timely fash- ion) and who are eligible to participate in the election  (i.e., voter resides within the boundaries of CD1).  • Early in-person voting begins. Please note: The NM  Election Code provides a directive to establish one  early in-person polling location at the office of the  county clerk. Additional Early Voting sites begin oper- ating on the third Saturday before an election.  May 15, 2021: Additional early voting locations open.  May 18, 2021: Last day to submit an absentee request for  domestic mail ballots.  May 25, 2021: Last day that overseas Military voters can  request an absentee ballot (for secure electronic trans- mission of the ballot; if the federal qualified elector is  requesting that a ballot be sent by mail, the request  must be made by the deadline of May 18).  May 29, 2021: Last day of early voting.  June 1, 2021: Election Day. Polling locations will be open  from 7:00 AM until 7:00 PM. Voters may vote in-person at  any of the locations within their registered county. Vot- ers who have requested an absentee ballot may also re- turn their sealed absentee ballot to a polling location  within their registered county, no later than 7:00 PM on  Election night.  Currently, there are six candidates running, one from  each party, one independent, and two write-ins:  • Democratic, Melanie Stansbury, Representative NM Legislature   • Libertarian, Chris Manning  • Republican, Mark Moores, NM Senate   • No Party/Independent, Aubrey Dunn, former State Land Com- missioner   • Write-in candidate, Laura Olivas   • Write-in candidate, Robert Ornelas  The League of Women Voters Central New Mexico,  of which this writer is a member, will conduct interviews  with the candidates and publish such material on their  web site: LWVCNM.org, and probably the Albuquerque  Journal will have information on the candidates. Fur- ther, all candidates will hold town hall meetings and will  have information on their web sites.  Please call (505) 243-VOTE (8683) with any questions  regarding absentee voting in Bernalillo County.  There will be 16 early voting centers, with details on  the County Clerk web site. The closest one to us will be  Caracol Plaza, 12500 Montgomery NE, Suite 101. Voting  begins Saturday, May 15, 2021, and ends Saturday, May  29, 2021. Open times are Monday–Saturday 10 AM – 7 PM.

Depending  on the species, bats will either migrate or hibernate dur- ing the winter. A few species of bats in New Mexico are  solitary, but most bats roost in larger colonies.   Bats are very beneficial to the environment. They  play a large role in pest control and pollination. Most  species of bats in New Mexico are insectivores and, at  night, a bat can eat more than half its weight in insects  such as mosquitoes. Bats also pollinate trees, cacti, and  agave.  Bats naturally roost in caves and hollow trees, but at- tics, voids in walls, and patios are also ideal locations for  them. Though bats are great for the environment, they  are not ideal visitors in your home.  The surest sign of a bat infestation is the accumula- tion of guano, or bat droppings. These are small, shiny  black pellets. After time, bat guano and urine will create  a strong odor like ammonia. A respiratory fungus (Histo- plasma) can sometimes be present in guano. When  breathed in, a deadly airborne disease, histoplasmosis,  can develop. In addition, bats can transmit rabies; how- ever, only a small percentage of bats are infected.  Protect Your Home from Bats  If you want to prevent bats from entering your home,  preventative exclusion is the best precaution you can  take. Because bats are not chewers like rodents, they  only use existing entry points to make their way into  your home. Smaller bats can crawl through a gap as  small as 3/8 of an inch, so it is necessary to seal any gap  that is a quarter of an inch or larger.  Another way to help prevent bats is to keep outside  lights turned off at night. The lights attract insects, and  insects are a huge food source for bats.   Additionally, bats drink a lot of water, so minimizing  water sources around your property, if possible, is an- other way to help prevent bats and other wildlife from  being a nuisance. However, with your home excluded,  bats are great to have around your home.   If you want to keep your home free of bats but re- ceive their benefits—free insect control and pollina- tion—consider installing a bat house if your space and  environment allow. A bat house provides a place other  than your attic where bats can roost. Keep in mind, pre- ventative exclusion is still recommended even with a  bat house. (www.batcon.org/about-bats/bat-houses)  Bat Removal Process  Due to the dangers of exposure to guano and the  ability for bats to squeeze through tiny spaces, consider  hiring a professional to remove a colony of bats. If you  are hiring a professional, check their reputation with re- views and testimonials and review their qualifications,  such as membership with the The National Wildlife Con- trol Operators Association.  A wildlife control inspector will perform a full interior  and exterior inspection. Due to the dangers of exposure  to guano, it is extremely important for a respirator to be  worn when in an attic containing bats. After inspecting,  he/she will construct a custom plan for your home to  safely remove the bats and properly seal your home.  Critter Control operators also provide warranty options  as well as educate you on our recurring programs.   • If a bat(s) is in your living space at the time of the in- spection, it will be the inspector’s top priority to keep  you as well as the bat(s) safe. Bats should never be han- dled with bare hands. Our wildlife specialist will use  gloves specifically designed to handle animals and en- sure the bat is safely released outdoors.  • The City of Albuquerque will pick up any bats sus- pected of being sick or injured.   The most effective and humane way to remove bats  is by utilizing a bat valve in conjunction with a full home  exclusion. A bat valve allows for bats to exit your home  but not re-enter. Since each bat removal is unique, our  specialist will use or create a bat valve(s) specifically for  your home. Most removals only require one bat valve.   Once the wildlife specialist installs the bat valve, all  other entry points are sealed, allowing for bats to exit  through the valve. Bats typically exit the property  within 3–7 days, depending on the colony size. After the  waiting period, there needs to be another thorough in- spection of the attic to ensure there are no bats pre- sent. Then the bat valve will be removed and the final  entry point sealed.   Six species of bats are federally protected, and nu- merous states have specific laws and regulations re- garding bat removal. To avoid breaking any laws or reg- ulations, call a professional for help when dealing with  a bat problem. Critter Control specializes in humane bat  removal and prevention.

We residents of Sandia Heights are noticing more piles of  dog waste in peoples’ yards; i.e., the roadside. The roadsides  here ARE part of our yards and we like our yards clean. We  would like to bring this to your attention so that if you notice  dog walkers not cleaning up, or who don’t seem to have  bags, reminders are in order. Perhaps offer them a bag—any  plastic bag will do. More of us are installing security cameras  to reduce crime and, as a result we are also able to find out  who needs reminders. If you have guests with dogs, please  let them know what they need to do.  Here are a couple handy ways to carry doggie bags. Photo  1: tie a bag to your leash. Photo 2: get an inexpensive doggie  pack that attaches to your leash—you can put a roll of clean  bags in the pouch and fasten a used bag to the clip, as shown,  until you get to a garbage can.  There seem to be a couple of false beliefs by those who  don’t clean up. Belief #1: There is a poop fairy. Fact: there still  isn’t one. Belief #2: Someone else can pick up your dog poop.  Fact: It’s an unpleasant job, and even those of us who walk  our own dogs don’t enjoy it; why should we want to pick up  YOUR dog’s poop? Even worse, how do you think a non-dog  owner feels about picking up your dog’s poop from their  yard? It’s as much fun as cleaning someone else’s toilet. The  majority of us dog owners DO use doggie bags, and we want  to remind you that we care about our neighborhood, our  health, and our New Mexico ecology. We expect the same  from you.  And as you can see in the following photos, the problem  starts to add up quickly and it seems to be getting worse.  Photo 3 is a sight becoming more common and Photo 4  (taken at the corner of San Rafael and Bluebell Place) is an  example of someone who has believed in the poop fairy for  a LONG time or thinks someone else should pick up LOTS of  dog poop for them. Both photos were taken on a recent walk  in the Sandia Heights area and we residents are very unhappy  with this situation. It’s not just an eyesore, it is a health and  pollution hazard.    Last but not least, the final Photo 5 shows where you can  (a) get a bag if you forgot one and (b) dispose of dog waste  properly; it’s located on Bobcat at the wash. That’s the good  news—someone stocks this station with bags and empties  the trash can; we thank them and appreciate the effort! It is  well worth it to keep our yards and environment clean.   Photo 1  Photo 2  Photo 3  Photo 4  Photo 5  [Ed: The SHHA Parks & Safety Committee volunteers stock  the doggie bags on Bobcat at the arroyo. The County also  makes bags available at Little Cloud and W. L. Jackson  Parks.]  8   The GRIT – May 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 5    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:  5 Juniper Hill Road – Re-stucco  11 Juniper Hill Loop – Reroof  29 Cedar Hill Place – Garage Addition   39 Sandia Heights Drive – Reroof and Re-stucco   50 Rock Ridge Drive – Replace Roof Mounted HVAC  60 Juniper Hill Loop – Reroof   163 Juniper Hill Road – Re-stucco  179 Big Horn Ridge – Front Door Replacement   208 Spring Creek Drive – Broadband Antenna Installa- tion  226 Spring Creek Lane – Screen Wall Installation Around  Propane Tank  430 Live Oak Lane – Landscaping and Pergola Installa- tion  441 Live Oak Loop – Landscaping   720-5 Tramway Lane – Roof Mounted Photovoltaic  Panel Installation   924 Tramway Lane – Replace Windows  931 Tramway Lane – Re-stain Vigas and Trim  937 Tramway Lane – HVAC Replacement   1007 Tramway Lane – Greenhouse Installation  1131 Marigold Drive – Parapet and Skylight Repair  1131 Marigold Drive – Stucco Repair  1199 Bobcat Blvd – Over Existing Front Patio Area with  Flagstone  1217 Rockrose Road - Reroof  1219 Rockrose Road – Landscaping   1235 Rockrose Road – Replace Windows and Sliding  Door  1453 Honeysuckle Drive – Landscaping   1468 Morning Glory Road – Reroof   1482 Morning Glory Road – Reroof   1802 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence Replacement and  Repaint House Trim  1812 Tramway Terrace Loop – Downspouts Installation  1829 Tramway Terrace Loop – Reroof  2405 Tramway Terrace Court – Roof Maintenance/Re- pair  2685 Tramway Circle – Install Additional Photovoltaic  Panels   2704 Tramway Circle – Replace Evap.

Whether in person or virtual, we will be showing the art works of ceramics, painting,  gourds, wood, jewelry, photography, weavings, and mixed media. We love what we create and enjoy  sharing it with you.     Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per  directions of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of every  other month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is  typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee)  as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a  September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with  15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time  of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
