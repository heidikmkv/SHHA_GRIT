When you saw the cover of the new 2021  SHHA Directory, did you say, “Huh, I’ve never seen an  owl in Sandia Heights”? Most people have never seen  an owl in the wild, and many people are surprised to  learn that owls share our habitat. Owls are nocturnal  and we aren’t, so it is uncommon to see one. You are  likely to hear them, though, if you listen after dark.   Many species of owls live in New Mexico, but the  ones you’re most likely to hear (and see, if you’re lucky)  in Sandia Heights are the great horned owl, the Western  screech owl, and the burrowing owl. The baby owls  (properly called owlets) on the cover of the directory  are great horned owls.   Great  Horned  Owl  (Bubo virginianus). This is  the owl you probably  think of when you think  of owls. They’re big— about 22 inches long with  a nearly four-foot wing- span—and they have the  classic clock face with  tufts of feathers that  look like ears. They are  formidable hunters, with  powerful talons and ex- tremely sensitive hearing  and night vision. Prey is  mostly mammals, usually mice, rats, rabbits, and rock  squirrels, although they will eat snakes and lizards as  well. These large owls will also hunt cats—another  good reason to keep cats indoors, especially in Sandia  Heights. Their call is the deep “hoo-hoo hoo hoo” that  every child will tell you is what owls say. You may see  them roosting in a tree  during the day, but as  you can see from their  mottled color pattern  they blend in well with  their surroundings and  can be difficult to spot.  Western Screech Owl  (Megascops kennicottii).  A much smaller owl at  eight and a half inches  long and a twenty-inch  wingspan, the Western  screech owl hunts smaller mammals like mice, but also  eats large insects and lizards. This owl can catch flying  insects in the air and can locate its prey by sound as well  as by sight. No hooting from this bird--its usual song has  been described as a “bouncing ball” song, with a series  of 6-8 accelerating low-pitched short toots. Despite its  name, the Western screech owl doesn’t screech. During  the day it may roost in tree cavities or snugged up next  to the trunk so it becomes nearly invisible.   Burrowing Owl (Athene  cunicularia). Also a small  owl at nine and a half  inches long and a twenty- one-inch wingspan, this  long-legged owl gets its  name from its habit of  nesting in burrows. Often,  they use a burrow dug by  another animal, but they  also excavate their own  burrows. You may see them using prairie dog burrows  or cavities in the sides of arroyos. They usually hunt at  night for mice and other small mammals, but are also  active in the daytime. In summer they eat large insects  like grasshoppers, beetles, and caterpillars. If they are  disturbed in the burrow, they make an alarm call that  sounds like a rattlesnake’s rattle to scare off predators.  Their usual song is a soft “coo-coooo.”  Social Distancing for Owl Watchers. If you are lucky  enough to spot a roosting owl during the day, be careful  not to get too close. Daytime is rest time for these noc- turnal birds, and they won’t sleep if you’re nearby. Think  about how terrible we feel after a night of being awak- ened repeatedly. The owl will not be hunting efficiently  after a day of being stressed. Bring binoculars and stay  well away from the roost, and be as quiet as…a mouse.  Don’t Poison the Groceries. Owls eat a lot of mice  and rats, and a lot of owls die from eating rodents that  have eaten poison bait. Don’t set traps or use poison  bait outdoors! If you kill mice and rats that are living out- doors, you’re only disrupting the food chain. You can’t  wipe them out, nor would you want to. Our native mice  and pack rats belong in our ecosystem, and they rarely  go into houses. Poison bait sickens and kills owls and  other animals when they eat a poisoned mouse or if  they eat the poison directly, as raccoons and bears have  been known to do. Small doses can kill large animals,  and a rat or mouse generally eats enough at one feeding  to kill not only itself,  but also a predator  that  eats  the   Gina Bonanno, audobon.org  Alexandra Mackenzie  audobon.org  Stan Keiser, audobon.org  Continued on page 3 …  3   The GRIT – February 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 2    dead or dying rodent.

Let’s keep Sandia Heights Beau- tiful together!  It seems that many residents are now leaving their  bins either on the roadside or next to their homes  where they are visible to neighbors and passersby. We  would like to remind everyone that improper storage of  trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia Heights Cove- nants which state in general, “Garbage shall be placed  in covered containers, said containers to be concealed  from public view….” Please, when your trash and recy- clables have been collected, return your bins to storage  out of public view.  We would like to remind all residents that trash (in- cluding recycling) must be out no later than 7 AM on the  scheduled pickup day or no earlier than 5 PM on the  evening prior to collection. During the warmer months,  you should not put any bins containing garbage out the  night before as we don’t want bears foraging in our  trash. Thanks for helping keep Sandia Heights a beauti- ful place for all of us to live.  … continued from page 2  4   The GRIT – February 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 2      December CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

The Kiwanis Club of Albuquerque built a wooden  structure at that location in the 1920’s that burned  down a couple of years later. They then built another  log cabin that was destroyed by high winds. So, at the  height of The Great Depression, the Kiwanis Club asked  the Civilian Conservation Corps to build them a new  cabin, which the CCC did over about a month in 1936.  The new cabin was made of local limestone and still  stands. It is accessible today by an easy to moderate  hike of less than a mile from the tram top or from the  Sandia Crest parking lot (see map).  The CCC used the cabin as an inclement weather shel- ter for the crews that carved out Sandia’s 28 hiking trails  that we still enjoy today; developed ski runs, towers and  lodges that are now Sandia Ski Area; planted trees; im- proved the Crest Road; and strung miles of telephone  lines. I was unable to find what the Kiwanis Club used it  for in general, though outings for school kids seems to  have been one use.   According to the U.S. Forest Service website on the  Kiwanis Cabin, “In the span of eight years, from 1933 to  1941, 54,585 Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees in  New Mexico built hundreds of roads and rails, 795  bridges, 472 lookout towers, large dams and reservoirs,  installed millions of rods of fences and planted millions  of trees for reforestation and to prevent gully erosion.  When these New Mexico men joined the corps, along  with 3.5 million other Americans, the country was in des- perate straits. Close to 25 percent of the population was  unemployed. Hunger and despair had become a way of  life. A group of local corps alumni want to see a memo- rial CCC museum of national stature built on the site  where CCC Camp 814 F-8-N Sandia Park once stood on a  piece of land just off NM 536, the Sandia Crest Road.  They want people to know what they accomplished in  youthful days during the Great Depression. And they  want today’s youth to know that youth are a major as- set to this country, just as the CCC men were when they  were boys. The CCC was the greatest-ever conservation  effort in American history.” Not sure when this para- graph was written, but sadly there can’t be too many of  those CCC boys still with us. If you or someone you  know worked for the CCC, we’d love to hear your/their  story. Perhaps you’d like to share with our GRIT readers.    Kiwanis Cabin      View from the Kiwanis Cabin.

Monthly Fun Fact    Numerous alpine (downhill) skis areas are within a few  hours’ drive of Albuquerque, including Taos Ski Valley,  Santa Fe Ski Basin, Angel Fire, Red River, Sipapu Ski  Area, and Ski Apache, just to mention a few in New Mex- ico. In addition, several notable resorts are located in  southern Colorado, including Purgatory Ski Resort and  Wolf Creek Ski Area. And, of course, we can access San- dia Peak Ski Area, our state’s oldest, from the tram that  departs from right here in Sandia Heights.      Apache Plume (Fallugia paradoxa)  Adapted from NMSU Plant Advisor    Apache plume is a common evergreen shrub in Sandia  Heights and environs, including non-cultivated areas.  It grows to 5' to 6' tall and wide, needs little water,  and can tolerate full sun or partial shade. Delicate  white, rose-like flowers in summer are followed by dis- tinctive, ball-shaped clusters of pink to purplish 1"  long, feathery seed tails. It can be an invasive by seed- lings and root rhizomes in rich soils when irrigated  regularly. Overwatering and poor drainage can kill  Apache plume. This is a good wildlife plant and con- tributes color year ’round.            9  The GRIT – February 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 2 10  The GRIT – February 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 2 11  The GRIT – February 2021 – Volume 37 – No. 2  Community Event Bulletin Board      None of these groups is sponsored by SHHA. Information is provided to keep residents informed.    Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” Dining Activity: Due to the pandemic, dining activities are cancelled per  directions of the Governor’s Office. When the situation resolves, we will again meet on the second Saturday of every  other month, hopefully starting in October, gathering in the homes of our members. Each small dinner group is  typically 6–8 people, including the hosts. We try to switch up the groups, with everyone rotating (host/attendee)  as the year progresses. The host decides the menu theme and prepares a main dish, with attendees contributing to  some part of the meal—along with a wine to go with their dish. The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal  elegance. Though most of the dinners are smaller, there are 2 whole-group dinners during the year, one a  September kick-off, and an end-of-season gathering in July. The dinner group was started in September 2005, with  15 interested couples from Sandia Heights. Adult Sandia Heights residents are welcome. To inquire or join any time  of year, call Paula Baxter at (505) 330-1518.
