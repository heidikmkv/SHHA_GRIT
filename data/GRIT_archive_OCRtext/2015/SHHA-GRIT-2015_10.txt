It was sponsored by John Betak,  President, Association of Sandia Heights  Neighborhoods (ASHN).    Guest Speaker was Lt Josh Kingsbury, Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s Office and our District 4  Bernalillo County Commissioner, Lonnie Talbert,  was in attendance.  Bob estimated total attendance  to be about 40.     Comments by Bob Bower:    --The meeting was well organized and ran in a  very professional manner.  John Betak did an  excellent job of moderating the meeting.  Good  comments from attendees and good responses by  Lt. Kingsbury and Talbert.  SHHA needs to  support Commissioner Talbert’s efforts in pushing  for modifications to existing DWI ordinances to  cover drag racing issues.    Bob’s full report of the meeting is posted on  www.sandiahomeowners.org website.    Coincidently, a front-page article about Drag  Racing … in Duke City was in the September 13  Sunday ABQ Journal and can be accessed in the  electronic Journal at  http://www.abqjournal.com/643455/news/drag- racing-shifts-into-high-gear.html        Communications and Publications   Classified Ads are free for SHHA members as  space in the GRIT allows.

It is difficult for  drivers to see walkers and joggers. Please  consider the safety tips below:  Pedestrian Safety Tips   Walk on the Left side of the Road  Facing Traffic; make eye contact  with drivers approaching you.   Wear a reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  evening. SHHA members can  purchase a vest in the office for only  $2!    If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.   Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single  file.   If you expect to be out before sunrise  or after sunset, please carry a light.  Safety of our children on or near our  neighborhood roads. Please be aware of  children walking and/or playing on or near  our small, winding roads in Sandia  Heights before and after school and at  school bus stops.         Halloween Trick or Treat  Reminder:   Please use extra caution as you drive  on Halloween and turn off your  entry/exterior lights if you prefer not to  have trick-or-treaters stop by your  home.

At that time,  PNM was also asking for an interconnection  fee that would be passed on to users who  install solar photovoltaic (PV) systems after  January 1, 2016.  These systems are usually  mounted on the roof of a residence.  The  rationale for this fee is to help maintain  PNM’s grid since customers with the PV  systems need access to the grid when the sun  is not shining and thereby not producing the   necessary electricity to accommodate their  household needs.  Saying that the PNM   request was “incomplete”, the Public  Regulations Commission (PRC) rejected the  request.    On August 27, 2015, PNM resubmitted their  request to the PRC.  This time, PNM is  asking for a larger increase of 15.8% due to  additional capital expenses and a continued  decrease in electric usage since its first  proposal.  Of interest to us here in Sandia  Heights who have installed or are planning  to install rooftop PV systems, PNM is  dropping its controversial interconnection  fee which would be aimed at those residents  with PV systems.  PNM did, however, issue  a statement that it has not totally abandoned  the idea of the interconnection fee and may  raise the issue again in the future.  So, stay  tuned and we’ll see what the PRC does with  this latest request.  I’ll keep you posted  when the PRC makes its decision.      Covenant Support Committee     By Josephine Porter, Chairman  It happens way too often in our  neighborhoods.  You look out your window to  enjoy the unique beauty of Sandia Heights.  Instead, your view is marred by a large, white  RV.  Or you are driving to your home on our  winding Sandia Heights roads and around a  turn you are startled to see a large camper  trailer or boat parked in a driveway.  Campers,  RV's, boats - we all have enjoyed their  benefits from time to time - but they just don't  blend into the Sandia Heights scenery.   That  is why our covenants prohibit their parking or  storage for any extended time period.     As an owner and resident of Sandia Heights  you know that the covenants benefit each and  every owner.  Our covenants help maintain the  beauty, quality of life, and the property values  of Sandia Heights. The Covenant Support  Committee (CSC) appreciates your support to  make certain that the covenants are respected.     The CSC does not patrol units looking for  violations but rather acts only upon written  complaints from neighbors.   If you see a  camper, RV or boat parked in your  neighborhood for more than the time needed  to load or unload, the CSC has a simple  complaint form to notify the committee of the  covenant violation. To obtain this form or if  you have any questions or comments, please  contact the SHHA office at 797-7793 or   shha@sandiahomeowners.org.

The application forms are not difficult to fill  out and are available at the SHHA office and  online at the SHHA website  (sandiahomeowners.org).  Make sure the  application is complete.  If you are not sure  how to fill it out, the SHHA staff will provide  assistance.  Remember that small projects such  as re-roofing, re-stuccoing, and repainting,  even if the new materials and colors will match  existing ones, require the application form.   Many of these applications can be approved  within a few days.  More extensive  construction projects will, of course, take  longer to review and approve.    All applications approved by the ACC  are listed each month in the GRIT under the  heading “ACC Activity Log”.  Occasionally, a  resident will notify the ACC of on-going  construction that is not listed on the log.  In  these cases, the ACC will determine if the  construction has been approved and if not, the  property owner will be contacted and asked to  submit an after-the-fact application.  Residents  can also submit a complaint to the Covenant  Support Committee (CSC) regarding on-going  construction or landscaping that is not shown  on the log and this complaint will be forwarded  to the ACC.  In these latter situations, the ACC  will also request an after-the-fact application.   Correcting after-the-fact changes to your  property can be difficult and expensive if the  ACC does not approve some or all of the  project.  Save yourself the hassle of this kind of  situation by applying to the ACC for approval  before you undertake the project.  The ACC is  here to help you so please take advantage of  our expertise and keep us in the loop when  planning and executing your project.  We are  willing to work with you to make your  remodeling experiences as pleasant as possible.      Judson McCollum Executive Broker 10 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-3717 JudsonABQ@aol.com Sharon McCollum Executive Broker 15 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-6217 SMMinABQ@aol.com Selling Sandia Heights Homes!

After an hour or more of presentations, discussions and rebuttals  by many, including the SHHA attorney, an SHHA member-hired attorney, the ASHN President,  Bernalillo County  attorneys, and John Lowe’s associates, the Zone Chg REQ (filed July 27) was  identified by those in opposition to be in conflict with County rules and was withdrawn.   The  applicant had filed the new request without waiting the County- Ordinance- required 12 month  minimum between Zoning actions.     On appeal, the original County Commission Sept, 2014, decision in case Zsup-2013-0039 to grant  approval to Panorama Homes Inc. for the Special Use Permit to build 30 homes was reversed June  25, 2015.  On August 7, 2015, the County with John Lowe filed a motion in District Court  requesting the same Judge to reconsider the opinion and order, or for remand to the County  Commission. It is unknown what will happen next in 2013 Zsup-2013-0039 or 2015 Zcz-2015- 0010; but, when anything occurs, information will be posted on the Sandia Heights website.
