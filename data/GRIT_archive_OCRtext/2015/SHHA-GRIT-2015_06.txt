Contact her at  emarks@abqjournal.com or 505-823-3842 if  you are aware of what sounds like a scam.   This week’s tips:        The door-to-door magazine sellers appear to  be hitting the streets . . . use caution.   The most important advice: Never let a  salesperson you don’t know or trust into your  home. Sometimes a purported magazine sales  crew also has a sideline in the burglary  business, according to the National Consumers  League. Never take this kind of chance.   On the other hand, don’t ignore a ringing  doorbell and pretend you’re not there, advises  Steve Sink, crime prevention manager for the  Albuquerque Police Department. Would-be  burglars sometimes pose as solicitors as a way  to check on whether anyone’s home. They’re  looking for vacant houses, so if you don’t  answer, Sink says, they might think the coast  is clear.   At all times, keep your door or screen door  closed and locked, while looking outside to  see who’s there. Tell anyone you don’t know  (or yell to them, if your door is shut) to leave.   A quick clue about whether the seller at your  door is legitimate is to ask whether he or she  has a permit, Sink says. The city of  Albuquerque requires solicitors to carry a  permit with a picture ID and to show it upon  request. If they don’t have one, close the door.  Note that youths under 17 and political and  religious groups are exempt from these  requirements.   If you don’t want to be bothered by door-to- door sales calls, you have the right to post a  “no soliciting” sign. If someone violates it and  knocks on your door (with the exception of the  protected groups above), call 242-cops and  report it. They have just broken the law.   Note from SHHA.  A Parks & Safety  Committee member has checked on the  availability of various “no soliciting “ signs in  the neighborhood and found that True Value  Hardware (Spain & Eubank), Wal-Mart, and  Lowe’s have a variety of signs for $2- $15.    2   The GRIT – June 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 6                                                                                                       Officers & Board  Members  President – Joe Pappe  Vice President – Josephine  Porter  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Woody Farber  Don Aunapu  Bob Bower  Anne Manning  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Emily Rudin  Marion Simon  Dick Wavrik  Bill Wiley      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor      SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org            For the GRIT Editorial Policy  please visit our website:  sandiahomeowenrs.org.

This follows rigorously adhered  to procedures, (see the SHHA website for a  description of procedures).  The following is  a summary of active CSC violations at the  time of the May CSC meeting:    Unit  No.  Type of Violation  1  Home maintenance, no prior  ACC approval   6  Vehicle/equipment parking,  landscaping. No prior ACC  approval  6  RV parking  27  Light intrusion  27  Trim color. No prior ACC  approval    1. In this month's GRIT you will find a  summary of active covenant violations  that the CSC is working on. The purpose  of this summary is to give you an idea of  the type of complaints and the Unit. We  have not included house addresses nor  have we included complaints that have  been closed out during the month. Some  of the violations are failure to get ACC  approval prior to starting a project. All  unit covenants require submission to the  ACC for exterior architectural and  landscaping changes. Failure to do so  results in a covenant violation.  2. Landscaping  April showers bring May flowers and  weeds.  Please don't let your property  "get away" from you. There is a  diversity of what homeowners consider  as acceptable Southwest landscape.   Dead trees and branch piles are not  included in "acceptable". If you hire the  work out, ask the landscaper where they  intend to dump the trash. We have had  complaints of debris being dumped on  neighbors’ properties. This is especially  true of construction material and hard  material (rocks, concrete, etc) as this  requires a long trip to the landfill.  3. RV's and Campers  The warm weather also brings out the  campers. Usually when your neighbor  files a complaint it is because the camper  has been on-site for a week or two. By  the time CSC investigates another week  has passed. This is way beyond a  reasonable time to clean and load the RV  for a trip. Many of our complaints are  against repeat offenders who are well  aware of the covenant  restrictions. Please be a good neighbor  and don’t keep your recreational  vehicles on site.        Announcements & Notices:   Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am –  4pm.    Board Meeting: Wednesday, June 10 at  7pm in the SHHA office.   Notary, copies and faxes, tram passes,  email alerts and contractor evaluation  binder free to members.   Committee meeting dates are posted  on our website calendar:  www.sandiahomeowners.org.   Classified ads can be found on the  website on the top bar menu under  Classifieds.    Safety Vests for sale in the SHHA  office. $2 per vest for members.    SHHA membership cards: do not  forget to go to the website to get a full  listing of the companies that offer a  discount!  4   The GRIT – June 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 6                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and  recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

The  wild predators have lived here for eons, but  only recently have humans invaded their  territory by building houses and paving  streets. It’s up to us to adapt to living in  wildlife habitat, and that means we may  need to change our habits in order to coexist  with our wild neighbors. This article will  focus on bobcats.  Like all predators, bobcats are territorial,  and typically have ranges of 4 to 10 square  miles. They are solitary, with males and  females meeting only for mating. Kittens are  born in the spring and stay with their mother  for 9 to 12 months. About twice as large as a  domestic house cat, bobcats usually weigh  15-30 pounds when full grown. The bobcat  gets its common name from its short  “bobbed” tail, 4 to 7 inches long. It has long  legs and big paws. The coat color ranges  from an orangeish brown to pale gray with  black spots and bars on its legs and chest,  and less distinct spots over its body. They  have black streaks on their cheeks and sharp  ears ending in tufts of black fur. Bobcats’  diet includes rabbits, mice, packrats,  squirrels, birds, and sometimes insects.   They rely on their keen eyesight and hearing  to locate enemies and prey, as their sense of  smell is not especially acute.  Bobcats hunt  by stealth, waiting motionless and then  pouncing.   Bobcats pose no threat to humans, but they  have been known to take small domestic  dogs and cats. Keep small dogs indoors and  watch them carefully when they are out of  doors. Cats should always be kept inside, as  they will fall prey to bobcats (and other  predators like coyotes, owls, and hawks) and  may also become infected with plague if  they catch infected rodents.     If you see a bobcat, there’s no need to call  Animal Control or Game and Fish—they  could kill the animal outright, even if they  tell you they will relocate it. Just enjoy the  sight of this fascinating and beautiful  creature. If you would prefer not to have  bobcats in your yard, then you should  remove anything that might attract them,  like bird baths, water features, and bird  seed. Water is an obvious attractant, but bird  seed attracts the animals bobcats eat, and  bobcats go where the food is plentiful. We  hope that a better understanding of bobcats  will help Sandia Heights residents happily  coexist with them. They are truly amazing  and magnificent members of our wild  neighborhood.

Thanks to phone calls, including  mine, the BernCO Sheriff's deputies issued 34 citations and 4 arrests, making it costly to the  offenders. The saturation initiatives by BCSO have resulted in large numbers of citations and  multiple arrests.            While the Sheriff is working on a strategic plan for permanently stopping this dangerous and  deadly activity, it takes time and resources, both of which are in short supply with BCSO. The  drag racing has been going on since 2005 (when the criminals were chased off Montgomery),  and some of us in Sandia Heights retain that historical memory. To assist the Sheriff, you are  asked to call their non-emergency number, 798-7000, to report the dragsters, no matter which  street in Sandia Heights they may be on. It takes every single one of us being security and safety  conscious to keep our neighborhoods safe. So, call when you first hear them. Help the Sheriff!
