The GRIT is posted  on our website on a monthly basis. The URL  address of our web site is  sandiahomeowners.org.  Security and safety alerts are posted on the  website as well as emailed out to residents who  have signed up for email alerts. The GRIT is  currently mailed and is also available on the  website in PDF format. If you would like to  save a tree and sign up for the electronic  version please contact the office. So far  approximately 228 homes have signed up for  the electronic version.  Members can log onto the website to update  their contact information, check on Tram pass  availability, and access the online directory.   Security Alert:   The office has a security email alert system by  which SHHA can send notices to people whose  email addresses are in our database.

A  couple of members stopped by after the meeting  and just left their written questions because of  the length of the meeting.   Board members are now reviewing all questions  or concerns and are putting together written  responses to each item as best as we can. We  anticipate posting the questions with our written  answers, reviewed by Board members, by the  end of March. If you spoke and asked a  question(s) or expressed concerns about a  Sandia Heights neighborhood issue, please look  for your answer(s) on the website.  In some  cases, where the question or concern is about  only one or two items, we may also be able to  send the individual submitting the item a direct  response. In addition, the Annual Meeting  PowerPoint Presentation Slides have been  posted to the website.           Letter to the editor: How to make  love to a cholla cactus    We live in a scenic part of Albuquerque with  fantastic views, just perfect for that early  morning or evening walk with the kids or dog.  None of that city stuff like street lights or  concrete sidewalks set back from the street that  hold sewer manhole covers crammed with  cockroaches to crunch under your feet at dusk.  In fact, we have the wilderness shrubs growing  right up to the edge of the street.

We also have the random opportunity to  witness a muley deer or a coyote cross the road in front of us.  There is a small drawback to this pleasant adventure that  sometimes distracts: The surprise is a neighbor or visitor  driving by at a speed significantly greater than the posted limit.  Can you get out of the way in time?  Can you get the stroller off  the road or get the dog to heel? This drama can usually be  prevented by walking on the correct side of the road. The  correct side of the road is to walk on is the left facing the  oncoming vehicles. Why? Do you ask. Well, it starts with how  you are built. Most of the creatures we know (including us)  have our eyes and our ears located on the front of our head. This  arrangement is to let us know what lies ahead in order to react.

Issues discussed and worked include the  following:  •  checked on maintenance and other  issues in both Little Cloud and W L  Jackson parks in our area   •  resolved issues with chamisa, weeds,  and trees in the right-of-way with  help from BC & NMDOT road  personnel;  •  checked out many residents’ calls  and concerns about park issues,  traffic safety issues in Sandia  Heights, and streetlights shining into  residents’ homes   We communicated via GRIT articles:    about dog poop and picking up behind  your pet;   about SHHA availability of orange vests  at a low cost to help walkers be more  visible to motorists;   about vehicle speed and parking,  bicycles and skateboards, pedestrians,  and emergency vehicle access;   about dead trees and fire hazards in  Sandia Heights. Dead trees and shrubs  in Sandia Heights are still a serious fire  hazard and may be a subject that the  P&S committee looks at again in 2015;   about SHHA & BC installing signs near  Tramway to remind residents not to feed  or leave food/trash out where bears can  get to it;   about the status of recycling with Sandia  services in our neighborhood;  We will continue to communicate in the  GRIT about various neighborhood activities  & issues.     Annual Report from the Finance  Committee   ~ Woody Farber, Chair    The 2014 Year-end Budget vs Actual  Report was posted on the website under the  Board Tab and was given out at the Annual  Meeting.   The Current Budget vs Actual financial  report will be posted on the website under  the Board Tab. If you have any questions  please do not hesitate to email them to the  SHHA office and we will respond.  The SHHA 2015 Board Approved Budget is  also posted on the website.   •  After reviewing the proposed 2015  budget at its November 12th meeting,  the Board approved the budget.  •  The Finance Committee developed  the budget based on the current and  projected reserves and the revenues  needed to cover the services needed  by the property owners.  •  While the Board increased the dues  from $8.00 to $10.00 per month in  2011 to cover the losses for the prior  3 years, the revenues and expenses  have evolved since then.  This  allowed the Board to reduce the dues  to $8.00 per month for 2015.  •  This change, along with other  changes, allows for a reasonable  targeted Net Income.  Each year the  income and expenses will be  reviewed to establish the best course  of action for the following years.  •  Budgets are projections which may  change as the year progresses, so  please go to the Finance Tab on the  Board section of the SHHA web site  for current details.      4   The GRIT – March 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 3                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water,  sewer, trash and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription  service separate from Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  membership.

These are so very important, especially walking against  traffic and having light clothes and reflective material after dark.  It is unfortunate that some folks  just won’t do this. Please, please, please follow the safety reminders below.  Pedestrian Safety Reminders   Walk facing traffic; make eye contact with drivers approaching you.   Wear reflective vest or brightly-colored clothing, particularly in the evening.  SHHA members can buy a safety vest for just $2.00 each!   If you are walking a dog, keep the dog to your left.   Whenever cars approach, a group of pedestrians should walk in single file.    ‘Adwetsomera dot otsent an endorser! by HHA  GREG LOBBEREGT ASSOCIATE BROKER, CRS “PROUDLY SERVING SANDIA HEIGHTS SINCE 1983!"

We  also know that mothers and elementary school  teachers sometimes have eyes and ears in the  back of their head. Did you know that it takes  about 90 feet for a motorist going 30 mph to  stop the vehicle? (That is longer than two  Greyhound busses and a Mercedes “S” class  end to end). It is difficult to react to a car  behind you because the noise or sight is  behind you, muffled by the hill or obscured by  the shrubs. Facing oncoming traffic gives you  the extra time needed to be safe. There are  traffic laws that guide wheeled vehicles to stay  to the right side, except to pass. You don’t  need the law to know that it is safer to walk on  the left side of the road, facing the oncoming  vehicle, it just makes good sense. Besides, you  need all of the time to react and not have to  make love to a cholla to be safe.    Andy Simon, SHHA member and Sandia  Heights resident     Covenant Support Committee  Annual Report ~ Dick Wavrik, Chair    The Covenant Support Committee was very  active in 2014 handling 72 complaints. The  CSC will only respond to a written  complaint from a neighbor.    The breakdown of the complaints is:  1.  RV, Boats, Cars - 24  2.  Maintenance/Landscaping/Trash - 22  3. Light - 7  4. Miscellaneous (barking, noise, traffic, kids,  parking) - 19  Of these, 9 required legal intervention.  Note  that there are 37 sets of covenants.  These  belong to the unit homeowners.  SHHA did  not write the covenants, and cannot change  or modify them, but can only enforce them.   We rely on voluntary compliance and will  use legal means only as a last resort.  We  also use Bernalillo County to do  enforcement if there is a code violation.    This was the case in complaints involving  animal control, on street parking, traffic, and  noise issues.  Sometimes it can take weeks  or months to resolve issues.    In 2014 Unit 24 dissolved their HOA.   While SHHA will continue to enforce the  unit's covenants we will not assume the  responsibility for maintenance of common  areas, which had been paid for by their dues.  Centex Homes formally assigned the right to  enforce covenants to SHHA.  Since we have  already been doing this the residents should  see no change.    Community Service &  Membership Committee Annual  Report ~ Executive Committee  The Executive Committee managed the 2014  events:    January Coffeehouse    Greg Ruggiero Concert    April Coffeehouse    Easter Egg Hunt     September Coffeehouse – last concert  Coffeehouse concerts and the Easter Egg  Hunt have been cancelled for 2015.  The Tram Pass program offers eight passes  per day. In 2014, 2211 passes were used and  445 unused which is an 84% usage rate.  SHHA Merchant Benefits Program is a  program that allows SHHA members to get  a discount from the 27 participating  merchants. Their discounts are displayed on  the SHHA website.  Association Membership continues to  increase slowly. We started the year with  1698 members, and ended with 1716, for a  net gain of 18.

It manages the architectural  control process for SHHA by approving  changes to the external appearance of property                       (e.g., new construction, additions, remodels,  and landscaping). There has been a decline  over the past two years of larger projects and  the Committee is receiving more remodeling  projects. The ACC conducts  neighborhood  reviews primarily for the large construction  projects.   The Committee meets the first and third  Wednesdays of the month and follows the  projects from start to finish. The ACC  publishes guidelines to assist residents with  the design process. The ACC also maintains a  Project Log on the website which displays all  current and on-going projects under the ACC  management. The GRIT publication lists the  projects approved for the month. Articles have  been published in the GRIT to help educate  the residents on the ACC process. The ACC  processed 309 projects in 2014, 305 projects  in 2013. The Committee continues to work  with the County Planning Commission on new  development efforts, Mhoon - Hawks Landing  and Futures for Children - North Tramway  Estates (which is being graded now for  fourteen homes). The committee will continue  monitoring these developments in 2015.  We will continue to keep the community  informed on the following on-going efforts:   PNM rate hike decisions – it is being  proposed that fees be increased in 2016.    Additional changes to County Wastewater  Ordinance and the effect of those changes  on our septic systems.         ‘Atvertsaments donot represent an endorsement by SHHA,  YEARS & YEARS  OF SALES IN SANDIA HEIGHTS  MAX SANCHEZ 228-8287  ‘Associate Broker MBA +’ CRS www:MaxSanchez.com ' www:SandiaHts.com  #1 Individual Coldwell Banker Legacy Agent  36 Years of Results, Integrity & Experience Selling More HOories in Sandia Heights than ANY other agent!  26 Year Resident...
