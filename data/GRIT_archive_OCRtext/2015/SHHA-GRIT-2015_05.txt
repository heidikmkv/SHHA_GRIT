All that is  needed is for the property owner to maintain  membership in SHHA. Many property owners  mistakenly believe that if they move from  Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in  SHHA. Not true!   Membership dues will  continue to be collected as part of the monthly  utility bill for that address, whether the property  owner pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If  you as a property owner pay the bill, you are  free to pass along the cost of membership to the  tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all  SHHA membership benefits except voting  privileges and filing covenant violation  complaints. Tram passes are among the most  popular member benefits, so be sure you  maintain your membership so your tenants can  experience some of the great “perks” of living in  Sandia Heights!  The GRIT  The GRIT is a publication of Sandia Heights  Homeowners Association, a non-profit  organization that represents the interests of all  Sandia Heights residents. The cost of publication  is supported largely from advertising revenues, so  please consider using the businesses advertising in  the GRIT!  Please be reminded to check your listing in the  2015 Resident Directory and Guide and let the  office know if you have any changes or  additions. All changes must be received before 6  November 2015 in order for them to be included  in the 2016 Resident Directory and Guide.  Parks and Safety ~ George Connor,  Chairman  We cannot be too vigilant …  Most of us feel safe leaving a vehicle in our  driveway, or parked outside our house for a  short time, maybe even leaving the garage door  open for a short while, but after the episode that  occurred recently on Tramway Place the  importance of being more careful cannot be  overemphasized.   One of our neighbors had a contractor doing  some work on her house.  She was very vigilant  in recommending that the contractors keep their  vehicles locked when they were working on her  property but they laughed her off, saying that  she must be kidding.  Last month, while the  contractor was at the house, his truck, including  all his tools, was hotwired only a short distance  from where he was working, and stolen!  It is a  1993 white Ford Ranger pick-up truck, plate #  DMJ 403.  If you see it, please call the  Bernalillo County Sheriff at 798-7000.  There are many ways that you can secure your  property.  If you have to leave a car outside in  the driveway, make sure it is locked and DO  NOT leave the garage door opener inside the  car.  When you are leaving your house, wait  until the garage door has closed properly before  you drive away.  Something as small as a leaf  blowing into the path of the moving door can  stop the downward motion and return the door to  a fully open position.  The same vigilance  applies when you get home – make sure that the  garage door is closed before you head into the  house.  For those of you with children,  encourage them to be as careful about the  security of your house as you are.  When  everyone is safely tucked in for the night, make  sure all the doors are locked and the windows  are secured. 2   The GRIT – May 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 5                                                                                                       Officers & Board  Members  President – Joe Pappe  Vice President – Josephine  Porter  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Woody Farber  Don Aunapu  Bob Bower  Anne Manning  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Emily Rudin  Marion Simon  Dick Wavrik  Bill Wiley      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor      SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org            For the GRIT Editorial Policy  please visit our website:  sandiahomeowenrs.org.

Most of these occurred in the spring and fall.  In each complaint case, the homeowners  were not in covenant compliance and were  asked by the CSC to remove the house  trailers, trailers, and recreational vehicles  from their property by a specific number of  days.  SHHA members who own house  trailers, trailers, camper trailers, boats,  mobile homes, and recreational vehicles  should check their unit covenants regarding  the parking or storing restrictions on those  items.   All of the SHHA covenants have some form  of parking or storing restriction on house  trailers, trailers, camper trailers, boats,  mobile homes, and recreational vehicles.  Unit covenants can be found on the SHHA  website or by calling the SHHA office.        Landscaping and Home Maintenance  Please be reminded that this is the season  when weeds begin to grow like weeds.  While we all have different opinions of  what constitutes good landscaping and how  much time we want to spend on our lots,  please look around your neighborhood and  try to be consistent.  It is also a good time to  consider if your house needs repainting, or  lots need cleaning, and get it done.  Please  don't wait for your neighbors to file a CSC  complaint for something you know you  need to do.  For most of us our homes are  our biggest investment and its value in part  is determined by our neighborhood.  So,  before it gets too hot, start taking care of  your property - your neighbors and the CSC  will appreciate it.   Parks & Safety Committee ~ By  George Connor, P&S Chair   With the warmer  weather, more  SHHA residents  will likely be out  walking and  exercising, some  with their  faithful companion, Fido. Remember dogs  need to be on a leash and you always need to  pick up after the dog poops. This is required  by County regulation and includes our two  neighborhood parks where adults and  children play. There is an off-leash dog park  west of Sandia Heights north of Paseo Del  Norte & Wyoming intersection. It is the  North Domingo Baca off-leash DOG Park  located at 7520 Corona Ave NE, two blocks  north of Paseo. This facility is a large fenced  in grassy area where dogs can run and play  to their heart’s content.  On another subject, if you keep dogs in your  yard here in Sandia Heights, you should  look at the Bernalillo County Ordinance  regarding restraint of animals. It is in the BC  Code of Ordinances, Chapter 6 - Animals  and has some excellent and important  information on the subject. One interesting  item was regarding electric or invisible  fences. It is in paragraph (e) and is:   (e)  A person who uses electric or invisible  fencing designed to confine an animal to  their property must clearly post a notice in  two separate locations upon the property that  such a device is in use.   Chapter 6 in its entirety can be found at:  http://www.newmexicoanimallaw.com/docs/ BernalilloCountyAnimalControl.pdf.   4   The GRIT – May 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 5                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash  and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

The best way to  keep solicitors from knocking on your  door is to display “No Soliciting” or “No  Trespassing” signs. Although permits  can be obtained that allow individuals  the legal right to solicit, privately posted  signs are a legitimate and legal way to tell salespeople to leave you alone. Please  report to Security any suspicious individuals and/or any individuals ignoring  posted signs.       Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants which state in general: “Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed from public view . . .”   Please, when your trash and recyclables have been collected, return your bins to  storage out of public view.

Sadly,  we have no idea how many bears are left in  the Sandias. Last summer we saw one or  two bears in Sandia Heights, so we know at  least a few bears survived after the  disastrous summer of 2013 when NM Game  and Fish killed or removed at least 80 bears  from the Sandias. This past winter saw a  more regular pattern of moisture, and we  hope that means a better food supply for  bears as they wake up from hibernation.  Even so, they may wander into our  neighborhood looking for food. Tender  green spring growth is not always enough to  sustain hungry bears!  We who have chosen to live in Sandia  Heights treasure our wild neighbors and  happily take the responsibility to live  peacefully with wildlife.  We hope that the  bear population will recover and continue to  thrill us with glimpses of them.  It’s up to us  to protect the bears that have survived by  keeping garbage indoors until the morning  of trash pickup, bringing bird feeders,  including hummingbird feeders, inside at  night (or waiting until November to put out  bird feeders), feeding pets indoors and  keeping pet food inside, and keeping doors  and windows closed and locked after  sunset.  If you have any questions about  bears or other wildlife, please call or email  Kate Fry, your Sandia Heights Wildlife  Steward, at 828-9618 or  kfry4956@yahoo.com.     Construction Courtesy and  Safety in Sandia Heights   ~ By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    This is the time of year when much of the  heavy outdoor construction efforts  commence here in Sandia Heights.   Although some of the following points are  included in the construction approval letters  sent to applicants, experience has shown that  a few of these points need additional  emphasis and that other items not included  in the approval letters need to be addressed.   When you have significant construction  efforts underway at your property, please  consider the following points as a matter of  courtesy to your neighbors and for the safety  of the community:  1. Please limit all noisy work to between 8  AM and 6 PM, Mondays through  Saturdays and try not to schedule  exterior work on Sundays.  If your  project involves significant amounts of  up-front excavation, please consider not  performing these activities on holidays  or weekend days.  2. Control your construction trash by using  appropriate trash containers so our local  winds don’t scatter the trash outside the  borders of your property.  Make sure that  the containers are periodically emptied  and, if possible, not placed in the street.   If your contractor is building your home  or addition using “green code”  standards, this code prevents the use of  on-site trash dumpsters.  Excess  construction materials are required to be  placed in piles instead of in dumpsters to  allow easier access to reusable materials.  Contractors should, however, use  appropriate trash containers for materials  not associated with the construction  (lunch trash, etc.).  3. Make sure your contractors provide  receptacles for the safe disposal of  smoking materials such as cigarettes.  Just like 2014, this spring and summer  may be the driest in many years and we  don’t need wildfires caused by the  careless discarding of cigarettes at a  construction site.  Please pay extra  attention to this item!    Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – May 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 5                                                                                                      Continued from page 7    4. Don’t allow your contractors to dump used  concrete, stucco “swill”, or other  construction materials on empty lots or  down street gutters, into storm drains, or on  AMAFCA or County-controlled  properties  such as water diversion channels.  If this  happens, you may get stuck with cleanup  costs.  5.  Please don’t allow your contractors to  create on-street traffic problems by parking  too many vehicles on the sides of our  narrow roads.  6.  Ask your contractors to limit the use of  radios and boom boxes that create  excessive amplified music at the  construction site.  7.  Make sure that your contractors maintain  proper sanitary facilities on site for use by  workers at all times.    Remember to stay involved with your  construction effort.  If you see issues such as  those listed above, take action to correct any  situation that you feel may create a safety issue  to the community or be an annoyance to your  neighbors.      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   9 Juniper Hill Road – Addition and  Landscaping  37 Cedar Hill Place – Deck Replacement  48 Pinon Hill Place – Reroof and Skylight  Replacement   66 Pinon Hill Place – Restucco  338 White Oaks Drive – Window and Door  Replacement  407 Live Oak Loop – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  547 Black Bear Loop – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  624 Cedar Hill Road – Play Structure  760-9 Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  872 Tramway Lane Court – Landscaping  883 Tramway Lane Court – Enclose Carport  887 Tramway Lane – Door Replacement  913 Tramway Lane – Roof Extension  941 Bobcat Blvd. – Window and Door  Replacement   1002 Tramway Lane – Refinish Trim  1501 Eagle Ridge Road – Reroof  1507 Eagle Ridge Road – Landscaping  1565 Eagle Ridge Court – Miscellaneous  Projects  1721 Quail Run Court – Garage Door and  Doors Replacement  1925 Quail Run Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  1928 Quail Run Drive – Replace HVAC  Enclosure  2007 Quail Run Court – Fence Installation  2432 Tramway Terrace Court – Replace  Swamp Cooler with AC Unit  2443 Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof  2530 Tramway Terrace Court – Restucco and  Trim  2728 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  2734 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  8237 Raintree Drive – Repaint House and  Walls  12601 Carmel Court – Replace Swamp Cooler  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.     -Abvetsrers onl worsen an enersemant by SNA  GREG LOBBEREGT ASSOCIATE BROKER, CRS “PROUDLY SERVING SANDLA HEIGHTS SINCE 19830" (OVER 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE SERVING THE "ALBUQUERQUE METRO AREA Fox A Count List OF Gre’ CunnENT Listes  New: AnQrORSALE-cDM “eww Gtonn.com  304 SPRING CREEK PL.

Submission criteria:  o You must be a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association and you must be an  amateur photographer.  o Photos must be related to the Sandia Heights area (see the 2015 Directory).  o Photos must fit reasonably on the cover without loss of the composition.  o Photos must be in color, and may be submitted digitally or by email to  sandiaheights@comcast.net.  o The resident must submit a statement that the photograph is an original taken by the homeowner,  that they are not a professional photographer (in business as a photographer), and that they grant  permission to SHHA to use their photo(s) in the Directory or on our website.      All entries may be picked up at the office once the Directory is published.
