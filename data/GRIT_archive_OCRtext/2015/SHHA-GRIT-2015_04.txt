Current Board members and our SHHA office  staff put in a lot of hard work restructuring  SHHA information and changing slightly the  procedures we use to manage it to comply with  the 2013 NM HOA Act. It was nice to get  unsolicited feedback about how we did the work  over six long months, and that our office staff  still has their excellent customer service  orientation when a Sandia Height’s resident  recently sold their home.    In response to an information request to the  SHHA office from a realtor in early March  regarding the sale of a Sandia Heights  resident’s home, SHHA sent the requester  the completed form (certificate required by  the HOA Act). The Bylaws, Covenants,  Financials and Rules of the Association are  all on the website: sandiahomeowners.org,  under the Board Tab.   SHHA received from Sharon McCollum,  Remax Elite Reality, the following  statement:  “You are great. I have to tell you SHHA is  so responsive compared to other HOAs.”     Communications and Publications  ~ By George Connor, C&P Chairman  Security Alert:   The office has a security email alert system by  which SHHA can send notices to people whose  email addresses are in our database.

While we know that a lot of people enjoy the  RV (and boat) lifestyle, please remember that  Sandia Heights has restrictive covenants that  must be followed.  Since the CSC does not  patrol the neighborhood, looking for violations,  you know that when there is a complaint it  originates from one of your neighbors.  Please  review your specific covenants before you bring  these items into your neighborhood.  You may  wind up having to store them off-site between  uses.  The inconvenience and cost of storage  should be considered part of the price of  ownership.  If you are an owner of rental  property in Sandia Heights, you are still  responsible for the property and you need to  make your tenants aware of the covenants,  hopefully before they move in, so they are not  disappointed when they have to remove their  boat or camper.  Landscaping  Spring is also the growing season.  Please don't  let your yard "get away from you".  Weeds  growing over a one- acre lot may not be as  noticeable as those in the denser, smaller lot  units. Remember, as a property owner, it is also  your responsibility to alert the tenant or property  manager to the responsibility of maintaining the  landscape. In Sandia Heights there is a range of  what homeowners consider to be acceptable  landscaping. The CSC recognizes this diversity  in their enforcement of the covenants. We would  suggest that you look at your property and those  of your surrounding neighbors and try to  determine if you blend in or stick out.    Who Owns the Covenants  A unit's covenants are a legal document that  defines the architectural and use restriction of  your property. They were originated by the  developer. Only the lot owners of a unit can  change or modify their covenants. This is done  by an Amendment passed by usually 75% of a  unit’s owners and filed with the County. There is  no overall set of covenants for Sandia Heights.  There are 37 units in Sandia Heights, each with  their own set of covenants.  While similarities  exist there are also differences. In filing a  complaint you will need to look at your specific  covenant to determine if there is a violation.   SHHA was an assignee of the developer for the  enforcement of the covenants. SHHA did not  write them, we can't modify them, we can only  enforce them as they are written. So who owns  the covenants?  You do!   Announcements & Notices:  Office hours: Monday – Friday 9am – 4pm.   Board Meeting – Wed. April 8 at 7pm in  the SHHA office.

Instead give your key to a  trusted neighbor.   If someone comes to your door asking to use the telephone, make the call yourself. Do not let  them in!   Install outdoor floodlights or motion-sensor lights to eliminate any areas where someone might  hide.   If someone in a vehicle asks for directions, answer from a distance. Do not approach the vehicle!    Prune shrubbery and trees so they do not obscure windows or doors. Plant thorny bushes or cacti  under your windows.   Sliding glass doors offer easy access if not properly secured. You can secure them by installing  commercially available locks or placing a broomstick or wooden dowel in the inside track to jam  the door.   Mark your valuables with your driver’s license number. Videotape the contents of your home.      Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights covenants which state in general: “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said  containers to be concealed from public view . . .” Please, when your trash and recyclables have been  collected, return your bins to storage out of public view.

The most prevalent  tree/shrub/plant species are piñon pine,  juniper, Apache plume, mountain mahogany  and four-wing saltbush.  These plants host a  variety of bird species not found elsewhere,  including Bushtit, Juniper Titmouse, Crissal  Thrasher, Western Scrub-Jay and Pinyon  Jay, all of which can be found year-round.  Western, and sometimes Mountain  Bluebirds seek out this habitat for their  winter residence. And in the summer,  various species, e.g. Scott’s Oriole, Cassin’s  Kingbird and Black-chinned Sparrows,  return to breed in piñon-juniper habitat.   Two of these bird species have been  identified by wildlife biologists who are part  of the New Mexico Partners in Flight as  being in serious decline:   Juniper   Titmouse    and                            Pinyon                    Jay.          In addition, the threat to the Pinyon Jay is so  severe that it is on the 2014 State of the  Birds Watch List, which lists species most in  danger of extinction without significant  conservation action  (http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2014SOTB)   The small, gray titmouse, distinguished by  its jaunty tuft of feathers, gleans insects and  seeds in both piñon pine and junipers. If you  listen carefully, you might hear it tapping  lightly on a branch to loosen an insect or to  break open a seed.    The Pinyon Jay, distinguished from the  more common Western-Scrub Jay by its  uniform powder blue and shorter tail, is  more social and travels together over its  large territory in large flocks, or family  clans. During the winter, they often visit  feeders, descending en-masse and jostling  for position on the feeder and landing on  nearby trees.  Their visits are brief and then  they are on their way again. As with other  jays, the Pinyon Jay caches its seeds.  While  it is known for its excellent spatial memory  and seems to know where it has stashed each  of the piñon-pine nuts, many do not get  consumed and play an important role in  maintaining the habitat.   The warming climate and drought have  created conditions that are jeopardizing the  health of piñon pines, making them more  susceptible to scale and a type of bark  beetle.  The beetles are already decimating  many of the piñon pines in areas of the  Manzano Mountains.  Those of us who are  lucky enough to have piñon pines growing  on our property have a special responsibility  to preserve and protect them.  Judy Liddell is President of the New Mexico  Audubon Council and the author, with  Barbara Hussey, of two books on birding in  New Mexico: Birding Hot Spots of Central  New Mexico  (http://birdinghotspotscentralnm.com/) and  Birding Hot Spots of Santa Fe, Taos and  Northern New Mexico.  Judy and Barbara  will give a talk on birding and sign their  books on April 11 at 10:30 am at the Rio  Grande Nature Center.  8   The GRIT – April 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 4                                                                                                          ACC Activity Log:   Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   534 Black Bear Road – Restucco  657 Roadrunner Lane – Re-roof  804 Tramway Lane – Fence Replacement  941 Bobcat Blvd. – Window/Door  Replacement  991 Lynx Loop – Re-roof  1928 Quail Run Drive – Replace HVAC  Enclosure  2315 Calle de Rafael – Re-roof  2324 Calle de Gabriel – Increase Wall Height  12622 Colony Place – Door Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.         KNOW HOW YOUR  ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL  COMMITTEE (ACC) WORKS ~    By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    I realize that this article contains old information  for many of our long-term residents, but for the  relative newcomers, I hope this article is useful.  Are you planning a home improvement project  soon?  If it will change the exterior appearance of  your property, you are required to submit an  application to the ACC. Please make sure that  you complete all of the applicable information in  the application form.  The initial step in planning your project should be  to review and understand the covenants in your  individual unit. The ACC also has a set of design  guidelines. Your unit covenants and the ACC  guidelines are available at the SHHA office or on  the SHHA website. Most issues found with your  project by the ACC, can be avoided if you do  your homework prior to submitting your  application.  The ACC processes about 300 applications each  year. Many of these applications involve routine  requests for re-roofing, re-stuccoing,  window/door replacements, heating and air  conditioning system upgrades, minor landscaping  efforts, etc. These requests can usually be  approved in a week or less.  However, projects  that involve major construction such as second  story additions, new garages, new walls and  fences, installation of solar panels, etc., may need  more time to process. These projects are assigned  to one of the ACC members who will meet with  you at the construction site to review the project.  The ACC may also elect to conduct a  neighborhood review to gather relevant  comments from your immediate neighbors  concerning possible impacts on their properties  that could result from your project. On these  more complex projects, the ACC strongly advises  you to take advantage of an ACC review of your  project at the early (preliminary) design stages of  the project before you commit to a final design.   You may find out that some aspects of your  design may not be approved by the ACC and it is  best to find this out at the beginning instead of  when the design is more mature.  One area where you can really help the ACC  understand your project, particularly if it involves  major construction, is to submit a plot plan that  shows the location of your home and proposed  project relative to your property lines. The  property survey that you received with your  property deed will usually be sufficient for this  purpose.  One final note: Please don’t ask the ACC to  expedite your application so your contractor “can  start next week” or that you need a fast approval  to take advantage of year-end tax breaks. The  ACC will work hard to expedite your application  but needs adequate time to do its job. Remember  that starting a project before you receive ACC’s  approval is a violation of your covenants. With a  little bit of advance planning, you can avoid these  issues. Come talk to us if you need our advice on  any of your projects—large or small!   Dain Buld Conraor Remodels Kitchens Baths; OG | Cen 505.856.5233. precerari  SUCCESSFULLY SELLING SANDIA HEIGHTS:  Pete Vere conus  SANDIA Hi ITS RESOURCES:  Get An instant Free Or  ete ost Coren Acute, Markt Dat for Sandia Heights ‘wwww.SandiaHomeValues.com  Drm calPateFor Your Fee Sales é and Marketing Constation 505-362-2005 pel  9 The GRIT April 2015  -Asvessoment ont eraer an onartmant by SHH  Move CIty URGENT CARE  ‘larng@ new path in hettheare  11601 Montgomery Biv, NE (Eas ofan Tabo}  (Open Mon-Fi9/AM to 7 PM, Sat & Sun 10 AM to3 PM  SKYES the LIM |  REALTY  sevneskyeshomescom  THE REAL ESTATE COUPLE WHO CARES! _ SKYE WHITE Qualifying Broker PAUL WHITE Associate Broker SPECIALIZING IN: SELLING YOUR HOME million of dlls worth of real xt  Wecamtributetoyourclosing oss Wedonte to dg rescue groupson ‘atone tale  lok forward to making your tea ete dreams come tre  CALL FOR A FREE MARKET ANAL)  1S YEARS & YEARS  OF SALES IN SANDIA.
