If you need maintenance on  your road/street, including snow removal,  please call the County at 848-1503. The  County is responsible for removing snow from  the public roads.       MAIL THEFT  Sandia Heights Security  says that mail theft is  still a problem.  Residents are advised  not leave mail in  mailboxes, either  incoming or outgoing. If you cannot retrieve  your mail promptly ask a trusted neighbor to  get it for you. If you are leaving town suspend  your mail delivery, have it held at the Post  Office.  If you have mail that would be considered  sensitive, you may want to mail it at a USPS  office. Another suggestion might be to replace  your mailbox with either a heavy duty locking  type or totally enclosing the box  with acceptable construction and a lock to  impede vandals as well as thieves.  Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle checking  mailboxes. A license number on a vehicle  along with a vehicle description would go a  long way to putting an end to this activity.   If you experience mail theft, notify the BCSO  (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876- 2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856-6347  and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in  progress notify BCSO and Security.     Septic Tank Quick Tips  For more details, read the US Environmental  Protection Agency’s A Homeowner’s Guide to  Septic Systems    Spread out laundry loads during the week- don’t do all the laundry on the same day.    Minimize the amount of household  cleaners you send down the drain, and use  less toxic products.    Don’t use the garbage disposal for  excessive amounts of food waste.    Use the proper type of bathroom tissue.  Septic-friendly tissue disintegrates quickly  in water into many small fragments.   Don’t flush anything down the toilet  except septic-friendly bathroom tissue and  human waste.      WEED AND FIRE SEASON IS  APPROACHING!  by Emily B. Rudin, CSC, ACC, and Board  Member  Our temperatures might be nippy now, but  in just a few weeks the soils will warm, and  with them—weeds. And more weeds. And  weeks of spring winds will spread seeds that  create…yes, you guessed it: even more and  more weeds!  In 2014, the Covenant Support Committee  (CSC) received scores of complaints about  landscaping and yard maintenance,  particularly in units comprised of patio  homes. If you own a property with zero lot  lines, think about the obvious importance of  curb appeal and the need for attractive  frontage so close to the street and so visible  among clustered homes.  CSC members invest time and effort to  investigate every complaint about  landscaping. But the very broad language of  the SHHA covenants—covering 37 units— in actuality means that the CSC cannot  selectively interpret and impose landscape  maintenance restrictions.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime,  along with the assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and  burglaries.  Consider the following prevention tips as well as ways to retrieve any lost or stolen  property.     Establish trusted relationships with neighbors on your block.  Agree to watch out for each  other and report any suspicious activity in and around your home.  Remember, residential  burglaries statistically occur during the day, so if possible, identify trusted neighbors who  might be home during this time.        Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants which state in general:  “Garbage shall be placed in covered containers, said  containers to be concealed from public view . . . “ Please, when your trash and recyclables have been  collected, return your bins to storage out of public view.

The CSC, however,  strongly encourages residents in the zero-lot-line units to be mindful that the appearance of their  yards has a greater impact on the surrounding neighbors than is the case with larger lots.    As a helpful guide for property-owners, these photos provide examples of “do’s” and “don’ts”:                               Please help your neighborhood, yourselves, and the CSC by controlling your landscape and  weeds throughout the growing season. Don’t wait until plants are unwieldy, become woody, or  constitute fire and/or safety hazards. Just as we schedule haircuts every so often, let’s keep our  properties looking cared for and attractive. In fact, while we’re at it, let’s remove our dead  vegetation too: this is one covenant that applies to all property-owners. Good landscape  maintenance will help keep our home values strong, our streets safer due to fire prevention and  clear sightlines for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, and Sandia Heights as beautiful as it can  be.      DO: Prune trees, pull weeds,  and trim hedges adjoining other  lots.  DON’T: Allow weeds to  encroach on your neighbor’s  property.  DON’T: Let weeds occupy  driveway cracks, giving your  home an abandoned  appearance and perhaps  inviting suspicious activity.  DON’T: Let weeds go to  seed and dead plants  convey neglect.  DO: Keep soil and gravel raked  and inhospitable to weeds.  DO: Keep curbs tidy  and corners  cleared. 8   The GRIT – February 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 2                                                                                                      ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   15 Juniper Hill Road – Door Replacement  18 Cedar Hill Place – Door Replacement  167 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  204 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Reroof  220 Spring Creek Lane – Landscaping  760-11 Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  and Wall  909 Tramway Lane - Reroof  938 Bobcat Blvd. – Landscaping  1035 Red Oaks Loop – Garage Addition  1115 San Rafael Avenue – Enclose Porch  1928 Quail Run Drive – HVAC Replacement  1950 Quail Run Loop – Garage Addition  2449 Tramway Terrace Court – Window and  Door Replacement  8251 Raintree Drive – Door Installation and  Gate Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.      PNM WANTS 12% RATE HIKE    By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    In mid December, PNM announced that it will be  asking the New Mexico Public Regulation  Commission (PRC) to approve rate increases for  its customers starting in January of 2016.  The  increases will average about 8% across PNM’s  customer base and is expected to generate over  $100 million in annual revenue.  If approved, the  class of residential customers will be looking at a  12-14% increase in monthly energy bills which  equates to about a $10 per month increase for the  average residential customer.  PNM says it needs  the extra revenue to cover new investments in  power plants and other infrastructure, the addition  of new assets for its renewable energy portfolio,  and to make up for a drop in power consumption  caused by energy conservation and a still- sluggish New Mexico economy that has  dampened overall energy demand.      One of PNM’s provisions in the rate hike request  includes a new monthly interconnection fee that  PNM wants to charge customers who install solar  photovoltaic (PV) systems after January 1, 2016  to help pay for their access to electricity from the  grid when the sun is not shining. PNM says this  fee is fair because other consumers currently  subsidize those with residential solar PV systems.   This fee is expected to be about $21 per month  for customers with  PV systems installed after  January 1, 2016.    Over the past several years, the ACC has  approved several dozen rooftop PV systems  throughout Sandia Heights so if you are planning  on installing one of these systems, do it before  January 2016 to avoid the interconnection fee.   My advice is to submit the ACC application for  installing your PV system before the October-- December 2015 timeframe since many of the  local PV system installers may be too busy to  install your system before the end of the year.    As expected, PNM is likely to face resistance  from various consumer and solar advocacy  groups.  Solar industry leaders fear that the  interconnection fee could dampen the economic  benefit of installing residential PV systems with a  resulting downturn of solar installation businesses  in New Mexico. There is an excellent article that  was published in the Journal’s Business Outlook  section on December 29, 2014 that explains the  situation and also describes terms such as  Renewable Energy Credits (REC) payments and  the concept of “net metering” which are terms  that will probably change if the PRC approves,  either totally or partially, PNM’s rate requests. As  PNM’s case for the rate hike goes before the  PRC, there are likely to be some changes from  what PNM proposes and I will keep you  informed of the PRC decisions and their impact  on residential customers.

We have received complaints of homeowners listing their homes on B&B  websites for room rental by the day, week, or month.  However, Sandia Heights is zoned  Residential (single family) and therefore renting rooms is a Bernalillo County zoning  violation. The Unit Covenants also prohibit renting rooms.  The CSC therefore asks that  homeowners comply with both the Covenants and the zoning regulations and not rent out  rooms. If you have already posted your house on a B&B web site please remove it. If you  suspect that a neighbor is renting out space in their home please contact the SHHA and they will  help you fill out a complaint. We will immediately investigate and seek compliance either  voluntarily or with the help of the County Zoning Department, or other legal channels. Aside  from the code and covenant violations it is also a safety concern for the neighborhood. Sandia  Heights Security monitors unfamiliar cars and activities in order to preserve the safety of the  residents. Remember, this is a Single Family Residential Area.  Please help keep it that way.
