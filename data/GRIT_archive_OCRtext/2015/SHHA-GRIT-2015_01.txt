All  that is needed is for the property owner to maintain membership  in SHHA. Many property owners mistakenly believe that if they  move from Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be collected as part of the  monthly utility bill for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If you as a property  owner pay the bill, you are free to pass along the cost of  membership to the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for  all SHHA membership benefits except voting privileges and  filing covenant violation complaints. Tram passes are among  the most popular member benefits, so be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience some of the great  “perks” of living in Sandia Heights!         3   The GRIT – January 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 1                                                                                                         What to do with that  Christmas tree?

Install  secondary thumbscrew locks on guide rails.  Place them in a location that prohibits  the window from being opened more than a few inches.  Also, make sure screens  are in place and secure.  (Note:  Windows and pet doors are common illegal entry  points.)  If it snows while you’re out of town, get a neighbor to drive into your driveway (SHS will  do this, time and terrain permitting) and walk up to your door. Drifts of snow are a dead giveaway  no one is home. Burglars don’t take days off due to bad weather.    Sandia Heights Recycling Update    Starting on July 1, 2010, Sandia Heights residents have been offered the opportunity to recycle.   Initially, only 5% of residents participated in this program, but this number has now grown to  involve over 80% of residents.  Since each person produces about 1600 pounds of waste each year,  and over 50% of this is recyclable, our efforts to “Go Green” have been impressive.    So where does this recycling go?  Sandia Heights contracts with the same company as Albuquerque  proper, and therefore our recyclables are delivered to the Friedman Company.  They are the largest  paper recycler in the Southwest, with three processing plants in Phoenix, Tuscon, and El Paso.  Our  waste is happily turned into paper towels, newspapers, trash bags, laundry detergent bottles, new  cans, and even car bumpers, as examples.   Recycling also conserves energy and resources needed to  produce these items from raw material, and it also reduces the tons of waste dumped in our landfills.

The approved budget was developed by the Finance Committee  after reviewing the current and projected reserves and revenues needed to cover the expenses  incurred for SHHA in support of the Sandia Heights property owners.  In 2011 the Board increased the member dues from $8.00/month to $10.00/month to address the  operating losses for the previous three years, and the projected loss for 2012.  Since 2011, many aspects of the budget, both revenues and expenses, have evolved and changed.   SHHA now finds that it has an excess of income over expenses, which results in building  additional reserves.  Therefore, the Board approved a reduction in Member dues to  $8.00/month for 2015.    This change, along with other changes to revenues and expenses, results in a reasonable targeted  Net Income.  Each year, the Finance Committee and the Board will review current reserves and  future revenue projections to determine the best course of action for the following years.  Since budgets are a projection of revenues and expenses, please go to the Finance tab under the  Board section on the SHHA web site for further details.       SHHA HOA COMPLIANCE:      The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) is in compliance with the NM  Homeowner Act (NMHOA).

I have been on many 501-c-3 boards inc  SHHA in mid 2000's. Interested in working on finances & covenants. I have lived in SH since  2005.    Marsha Thole: As a nearly 21-year resident of Sandia Heights and member of SHHA, I have  seen and experienced a lot up here. I have previously served on the Board as the Secretary and  with the ACC for 6 years, and as a volunteer for 5 years on committees (ACC and Community  Service & Membership). My previous accomplishments include establishing a structure for the  board and other meeting minutes, requiring an agenda posted prior to meetings, implementing  parliamentary procedure; establishing the Official Record Board, developing a script for the  annual meeting, and developing the Bylaws Committee and overseeing changes to the bylaws.  I am a retired Air Force officer, having served in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war;  worked in academia as a faculty instructor in computer science, English and writing, and  communications; management/research analyst for Department of Defense agencies; and am a  writer/editor in private industry. I also am a choir director at my church. Finally, I am a  parliamentarian and a member of the National Association of Parliamentarians.     With 50+ years of volunteering experience, starting in grade school playing the piano at nursing  homes, I am also an active life member of two major military associations. I have served on non- profit boards in various locations, including Albuquerque. I have extensive previous homeowner  association experience, having lived in covenant-controlled communities for 40 years, serving on  HOA and condo boards in both officer and director capacities.  There are several things all associations have in common, not the least of which are: (1)  Involving its members; (2) Making sure there is open communication and transparency with the  membership and the board; and (3) Planning for the future through a Strategic Plan. We need a  strategic plan, for the good times and the bad times. SHHA is not a mandatory-membership  association, and we need to plan for the possibility of either more members or fewer members, in  order to keep it viable to enforce the covenants—its primary mission. I know Sandia Heights,  and know the issues in our community. I am concerned about maintaining property values in  Sandia Heights, and will work to that end as well as to ensure the health of the association.         7   The GRIT – January 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 1                                                                                                      Continued from page 4    Not only is recycling good for the  environment, but Sandia Heights receives a  “rebate” based on the tons of material received  each year.  This rebate is used to offset some  of the costs of recycling, allowing this service  to be free for residents.    If you currently are not recycling, how can  you get into this program?  Simply call Sandia  Heights Services at 856-6419 to request up to  one free green topped recycle bin, 96 gallon or  64 gallon, be delivered to your property.   Additional bins can be rented for $4.50/month  for a 96 gallon bin or $3.50/month for a 64  gallon bin.     Items made of paper, cardboard, aluminum,  foil, or tin/steel can be recycled.  For a more  complete list see the Sanitation Services  Policies and Information  sheet on the  Sanitation page of the Sandia Heights Services  website: sandiaheightsservices.com. This site  also has a calendar showing the bi-monthly  pickup days for your particular section of  Sandia Heights.  Recycle bins should be  moved to curbside by 7AM on your regular  trash collection day, every other week.  The  recyclables should be rinsed and placed loose  in the bin or in paper bags, not enclosed in  plastic bags.    If you wish to personally drop off recyclable  materials, you can take them to one of the  Albuquerque recycle drop-off sites, as listed  on the Albuquerque city website (www.  Cabq.gov/solidwaste/recycling/recycling- dropoff).   The closest drop-off site to Sandia  Heights is at 6301 Eagle Rock, NE (off 1-25  and Alameda) for general trash, recycling, and  even electronic waste.   Sandia Heights  Services DOES NOT collect RECYCLE  GLASS.  You can take your RECYCLE  GLASS to behind the Smith’s Store at  Wyoming and Paseo del Norte or to the city  recycle Bins behind the Bear Canyon Senior  Center off Pitt St NE near Morris &  Montgomery intersection.   So let’s shoot for 100% participation in 2015.   Recycling is an easy and convenient way to  help keep our planet healthy.          Covenant Support Committee ~  By Dick Wavrik, Chairman, CSC   Light Pollution  Most of the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants  address light pollution. This is done to  preserve the enjoyment of the night sky from  light pollution. Regardless of the individual  covenants for your Unit, the entire North  Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights fall  under the Bernalillo County Code for light  pollution. The code includes, but is not  restricted to security lighting, street lights,  landscape lights, building mounted area lights,  building façade lights. In general, lights shall  remain OFF between 11:00 pm and sunrise;  lights on buildings shall be mounted no higher  than 16 feet; lights must be shielded so the  light is directed perpendicular to the ground.    To see the entire code and for exceptions, go  to the Bernalillo County Website  (www.bernco.gov) and look under ordinances,  Section 30-186. So, if you leave your lights on  at the entry, garage doors, house floods, after  11:00pm and they are not shielded they may  be in violation of the County Code. While the  CSC does not enforce County ordinances we  will work with folks to make them aware of  the options and try to get resolution. At night,  even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to enjoy  the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city below.                   Trash and Recycle Bins   We would like to remind everyone that  improper storage of trash cans is a violation of  all our Sandia Heights Covenants which state  in general:  “Garbage shall be placed in  covered containers, said containers to be  concealed from public view…”    Continued on page 8  8   The GRIT – January 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 1                                                                                                      Continued from page 7  Please, when your trash and recyclables have  been collected, return your bins to storage out of  public view.  Thanks for helping keep Sandia  Heights a beautiful place for all of us to live.    Covenant Violation  When you file a form for a Suspected Covenant  Violation Please be assured that the CSC is  working on your behalf. The CSC’s process  includes investigating suspected violations and  ensuring compliance if appropriate, which can  entail multiple site visits, photographs, and  letters. This process, including time for  corrective action, may take weeks or months.   The file will remain active during this process.  Once it has been completed you will receive a  letter stating that we have closed the file.         ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since  the last GRIT:   32 Cedar Hill Place – Restucco  58 Juniper Hill Court – Porch and Stucco  Repair and Roof Maintenance  196 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Carport Enclosure  189 Big Horn Ridge Circle – Reroof, Door  Replacement and Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  215 Spring Creek Place – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  305 Big Horn Ridge Place – Replace Driveway  and Retaining Walls  435 Live Oak Loop – Garage Door  Replacement  558 Black Bear Place – Window Replacement  577 Black Bear Road – Window Replacement  726-17 Tramway Vista Drive - Photovoltaic  Panel Installation  727-3 Cedar Hill Lane - HVAC  741 Tramway Lane – Repair and Paint House  Trim  918 Tramway Lane – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation   932 Tramway Lane – Landscaping  1169 Laurel Loop - Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  1183 Laurel Loop – Repair/Replace Irrigation  System  1199 Bobcat Blvd. – Frame Cover  1849 Tramway Terrace Loop – Shed  1928 Quail Run Drive – Reroof, Restucco and  Refinish Trim  2429 Tramway Terrace Court – Shading  Device  2739 Tramway Circle – Reroof and Restucco  2864 Tramway Circle – Repaint Garage Door  8233 Raintree Drive – Window Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.       Summary of ACC Articles  Published in 2014 by Bob Bower, ACC  Chairman    Jan:  Summary of Articles Published in 2013  Feb:  Choosing Your Contractor  Mar: Construction Courtesy and Safety in  Sandia Heights  Apr:  Landscape Restoration—An ACC  Requirement  Jul:  Fire Season is Here Again!
