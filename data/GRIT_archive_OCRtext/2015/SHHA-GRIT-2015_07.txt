Parks & Safety ~ By George Connor,  Chair  Zoning Variance Request made for a  Domino's restaurant -   Early in June, 2015, a few SHHA residents and  one SHHA board member attended a BC Zoning  Variance request hearing regarding signage for a  new business between the CVS & Valvoline  businesses west of Tramway Blvd. and south of  Paseo Del Norte.  SHHA objected to the  requests for sign variances because the owner  wanted 50% more sq footage for signage and an  additional free standing pole sign about 50%  taller that BC ordinances allow.  The Zoning  Judge denied all requests the following week.   The owner has since appealed and re-filed a  modified Variance Request with significantly  reduced overall sign sq footage (now only15%  greater than Ordinance limits) and requests only  one additional standalone pole sign within the  BC Ordinance sign height allowance of 16 ft.   SHHA believes this to be reasonable and does  not intend to object to the Variance Request at  the July 1, BC Planning Commissioner Hearing.   Updates regarding this matter will be posted on  the SHHA website after the July 1 BC Appeal  hearing   Classified Ads: are free for SHHA  members as space allows.

Viewing the online version is  free. The printed mailed GRIT costs SHHA members over  $13,000 per year and lots of trees! You can sign up to receive  email alerts and you will receive a notification, including the  link, when the online version of the GRIT is available for  viewing. The aim is to have members consider receiving the  GRIT electronically instead of the printed version. The  advantages, besides saving trees and reducing mailing and  printing costs, are quite attractive: the electronic version is in  color and has useful internet links to passive and dynamic  internet pages. For example, we can, in the future, include video  and PowerPoint presentations of events of interest to SH  residents. Also, the on-line version is higher resolution. If you  do decide to sign up for the online GRIT you will also receive  email alerts regarding any activity in the Sandia Heights area  that might affect you, such as a wildlife alert or a security issue.  To sign up either email our office at sandiaheights@comcast.net  or call 797-7793.  3   The GRIT – July 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 7                                                                                                      Gnats Bugging  You?   If you have lived in  Sandia Heights for  any length of time,  you’re uncomfortably familiar with our gnat  population. When the gnats are at their  worst, outdoor activities become  increasingly unpleasant as the gnats swarm  around us and dive into eyes, ears and noses.  Thankfully, there appears to be a solution to  the problem that in environmentally safe and  nontoxic to humans and pets. Cedar oil,  which is extracted from the bark of cedar  trees, is a safe and natural insect repellent  that is effective against gnats. Several  companies make cedar based insect  repellents for the yard, and we have heard  reports from a number of residents that these  products do a good job of keeping the gnats  at bay. Two companies which appear to  have good reviews are Cedarcide Industries,  Inc. (www.cedarcide.com) and Greenbug  All Natural Pest Control Products  (www.greenbugallnatural.com). These  companies also make repellents for use by  people and pets.   Parks & Safety Committee ~ By  George Connor, P&S Chair   Street Right of Way Maintenance  The County right of way usually extends a  few feet beyond the paved edge of the street  into Sandia Heights properties. Each of us is  responsible for maintaining our part of the  right of way. Consider cutting thick  vegetation away from the entrance/exit of  your driveways so that both you and  oncoming cars and pedestrians have better  visibility.  The County works closely with SHHA to  cut along all roadsides at a 45-degree angle  in order to help improve visibility and traffic  safety. This has helped a great deal, but it  does not solve all problems for pedestrians  or drivers. We want to encourage each of  you to call the SHHA office if you note  specific areas where either the vegetation is  too overgrown or perhaps signs are being  blocked by trees and vegetation at  intersections. (The County prefers to have  one contact with SHHA for reporting such  nuisance areas.)  If you have a Siberian elm growing in the  County right of way of your property, please  call the County directly at 848-1503. They  will remove the tree and treat it with Garlon  to prevent re-growth. The County requires  the homeowner to make the request directly  to them, rather than by way of the SHHA, to  be sure that the homeowner wants the tree  removed.   Parks & Safety Committee ~ By  George Connor, P&S Chair   Over the last year or so, a number of Sandia  Heights residents have contacted the SHHA  office about various SAFETY concerns in  our neighborhood. These requests include  vehicle speeding, vehicle parking which  blocks road access, bicycle & skateboard  speeding, children playing in our streets,  blind spots on our narrow county roads,  concerns about deer and vehicle collisions,  lack of vehicle & pedestrian safety signage  in our neighborhood, etc. Each specific  request is checked and replied. Below is  some information about this subject that  may be of interest to Sandia Heights  residents.      Vehicle speeding has been and will continue  to be an issue. The County has posted speed  limit signs, put in speed humps and  continues to be the responsible for  enforcement. Vehicle parking that blocks  our narrow roads is in violation of County  ordinances.

The primary function of the security patrol is to  provide a high visibility deterrent to crime in the Sandia Heights and Primrose  Pointe subdivisions. For members, the patrol also responds to residential alarm calls,  suspicious persons and vehicles, lost persons or pets and assists the Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s and Fire Departments as needed or requested.  Other functions of  the patrol are to provide special watches for residents who are away from their  homes, as well as responding to loud parties, alarms, etc. In some cases, the patrol can assist  motorists with vehicle problems such as jump-starts. The Patrol consists of five officers who patrol  approximately 116 hours per week seven days a week. Shift hours are occasionally staggered as  designated by the manager to provide an element of unpredictability.       Trash and Recycle Bins   Remember that improper storage of trash cans is a violation of all our Sandia  Heights Covenants which state in general: “Garbage shall be placed in covered  containers, said containers to be concealed from public view . . .”   Please, when your trash and recyclables have been collected, return your bins to  storage out of public view.

But that  thinking is so? 20th Century. I’ve had rooftop  PV solar powering my house since 2006. But  solar prices have dropped so fast that my 2006  system could now be installed for 1/3 the price.  It is now literally less expensive to go solar  than to keep paying your electric bill. Want to  see how? Check out this great non-commercial  web site, www.energysage.com. It gives you an  instant solar quote showing your savings, using  only your address and average electric bill. It  provides two quotes, one for cash and one for a  zero-down lease. If you choose, it can then  send this to local solar installers who will  compete for your business. How sweet is that?
