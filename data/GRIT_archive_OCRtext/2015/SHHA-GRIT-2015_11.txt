Due to a billing error, dues were collected for  October. Because of this, no dues will be  collected for November and December. This was  made possible due to revenues being slightly  greater than budgeted, while expenses were less  than budgeted. If you are not a member,  consider joining (for a period of no less than one  year) and enjoy two months FREE!

So do  all of us a favor and take a peek at one or more  of the links on our website:  https://sandiahomeowners.org/outdoors-in- sandia-heights/15577-water-conservation   They  reportedly have very GOOD information about  conserving water in the normally dry  environment we have in New Mexico.      Communications and Publications    Classified Ads are free for SHHA members as  space in the GRIT allows.

All  that is needed is for the property owner to maintain membership  in SHHA. Many property owners mistakenly believe that if they  move from Sandia Heights and rent their house to another  family, they must cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be collected as part of the  monthly utility bill for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If you as a property  owner pay the bill, you are free to pass along the cost of  membership to the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for  all SHHA membership benefits except voting privileges and  filing covenant violation complaints. Tram passes are among  the most popular member benefits, so be sure you maintain your  membership so your tenants can experience some of the great  “perks” of living in Sandia Heights! Renters may also choose to  subscribe to Security Service by calling Sandia Heights  Services at 856-6419.         SHHA Membership Cards:     Check out the entire SHHA Member Benefits Program at  sandiahomeowners.org and enjoy discounts at our supporting  local merchants.

It is difficult for  drivers to see walkers and joggers. Please  consider the safety tips below:  Pedestrian Safety Tips   Walk on the Left side of the Road  Facing Traffic; make eye contact  with drivers approaching you.   Wear a reflective vest or brightly- colored clothing, particularly in the  early morning and evening. SHHA  members can purchase a vest in the  office for only $2!    If you are walking a dog, keep the  dog to your left.   Whenever cars approach, a group of  pedestrians should walk in single  file.   If you expect to be out before sunrise  or after sunset, please carry a light.  Safety of our children on or near our  neighborhood roads. Please be aware of  children walking and/or playing on or near  our small, winding roads in Sandia  Heights before and after school and at  school bus stops.         4   The GRIT – November 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 11                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer,  trash and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service  separate from Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

In June I took over the chairmanship of the  Covenant Support Committee from Dick  Wavrik.  On behalf of the committee, the  SHHA Board and the SHHA community we  thank Dick for his tireless and conscientious  leadership.      Although I have been a member of the CSC  for several years it was only after taking  over as chair that I realized the full extent of  the CSC’s work.  Since the beginning of this  year we have worked on over 40 complaints.  In only 3 months, from June through  August, we opened over 25 files! In  September alone we closed 14 covenant  complaints.     We have six dedicated volunteer committee  members who take on assignments as  covenant complaints are received by the  SHHA office. Betsy Rodriquez, from the  SHHA office, with her extensive knowledge  of the covenants provides invaluable support  to the committee.  Either Betsy or Amanda  Allen, our new SHHA Office Manager, are  available to help with any covenant  complaints and answer questions a SHHA  member might have about enforcement.     Within 30 days (often much sooner) of  receiving a written complaint in the SHHA  office, a committee member independently  investigates with a site visit and sometimes  phone conversations or personal visits with  the involved parties.  Covenants are  researched and reports are made. Depending  on the issue and whether a covenant  violation is confirmed, letters go out and  follow-up continues.  It is a time and labor  intensive, but rewarding, process.     Many homeowners do not know that Sandia  Heights is comprised of 37 units and each of  those units have their own set of covenants.  Some covenants are detailed in their  coverage while older units have use  restrictions that provide less instruction.  But  the objective of the covenants and the CSC’s  work is the same no matter what covenants  we are being asked to enforce…to maintain  the unique character of Sandia Heights while  still preserving the property rights of the  owners.     The CSC members meet once a month to go  over the complaints and discuss issues.  It is  a great group and there is no dearth of  interesting or controversial questions.  We  are dedicated to enforcing the covenants of  all SHHA units in a consistent, uniform  manner.     Not to be forgotten is a loud “shout out” to  the Sandia Heights community.  Without  your conscientious attention to your  neighborhood and without your cooperation  the CSC would be powerless and  ineffective. Because the covenants are a  property right of the lot owner the SHHA  and the Covenant Support Committee are  dependent on each individual’s cooperation  to maintain the life style, uniqueness and  beauty of the subdivision by following the  covenants of the individual units.  Thank  you.

By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC      It’s too early yet to tell if  Albuquerque’s upcoming winter of  2015- 2016 will be unusually cold or not but I think  it’s always a good time right now to remind  you how to protect your water pipes from the  effects of very cold weather.  Most of the  “local experts” on this subject generally agree  that steps need to be taken to protect water  pipes if temperatures are expected to drop  below 21 degrees Fahrenheit.  A broken  water pipe inside your home can cause a lot  of extensive and expensive damage!    Let’s start with the outside of your  home.  Disconnecting water hoses and  protecting outdoor water faucets are very  important.  Water that freezes in outdoor  hoses connected to faucets causes a buildup  of pressure on interior plumbing that can  result in a rupture of the interior pipes if the  pressure is too high.  Damage to these interior  pipes near an outdoor water faucet is often  difficult to repair due to the inaccessibility of  these pipes.  Disconnecting hoses from these  outdoor faucets and protecting the faucets  with hard foam insulating cups are good ways  to reduce the chances of damage to these  water pipes that extend through your exterior  walls.  These inexpensive foam cups can be  purchased at most home improvement or  hardware stores and are easy to install.  I’ve  also found that it is wise to wrap the outdoor  faucet with some insulation prior to placing  the foam cup over the faucet, particularly if  the faucet is located on the north side of your  home or is located in an area that does not  receive any winter sunshine.

Now, let’s consider the inside of your home.  If Albuquerque experiences a spell of  extremely cold weather where temperatures, particularly at night, drop to below the 21 degrees  Fahrenheit “benchmark”, leave the water supply line on at a very slow drip rate somewhere  inside your home.  Water in “slow motion” is much less likely to freeze than water that is  motionless inside of a pipe.  Normally, a faucet located far away from where the water enters  your home is the one that you should use for this purpose.  The cost of water used is insignificant  compared to the cost of repairing damage caused by a broken water line inside your home.   Normally, these very cold spells don’t last long so leaving an indoor faucet dripping for a few  days and nights should get you through these spells until warmer temperatures return.  If you are  away from your home during the cold season, make sure that there is adequate heat inside your  home to prevent internal pipes from freezing.  Even when trying to save energy costs, don’t turn  the heat too far down (experts recommend no lower than 55 degrees F) and don’t turn the heat  off altogether unless you have all of the water lines properly drained.  Believe me, I have seen  the damage caused by pipes that have not been properly drained and have subsequently burst  inside the home where the heat has been turned off!      One final note for those of you who have swamp coolers.  If you have not already done  so, be sure to drain the water reservoir and disconnect and drain the water supply line. It doesn’t  take much of a freeze to damage these cooler components.  Have a great winter!
