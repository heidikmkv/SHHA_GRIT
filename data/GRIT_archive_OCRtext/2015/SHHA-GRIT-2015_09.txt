We have a bumper crop of acorns  this year, so we can expect to see bears in  our neighborhoods eating acorns. Don't be  alarmed--just leave the bear alone and it will  move on. Acorns are a natural food source  for bears, so they have every right to be here  sharing our space. Don't call NM Game &  Fish unless the bear is actively threatening  your safety. If you call NMG&F, they will  come out and trap the bear. Trapping and  relocating is pretty much a death sentence  for the bear. And remember to keep bears  out of trouble by keeping garbage indoors  until the morning of trash pickup. Let them  eat acorns, not cake! Call Kate Fry at 681- 6373 or email bobkat4250@yahoo.com if  you have any questions or would like to  know more about bears and other wildlife.   Dead Tree Cutting and Removal  by project Coordinator for Parks & Safety  member Suzanne Schneider   Do you or a nearby neighbor have a DEAD  TREE or SHRUB in your yard(s) or on  nearby County right-of-away?   This  problem has increased dramatically the last  few years because of the prolonged drought  and bark-beetles attacking live and/ or dying  conifer trees.   Many of us have not  remembered to do regular DEEP ROOT  watering of our plants on a frequent basis,  year round to keep them from dying or  attracting bark-beetles.    So what should we do now?  First, go back  to or continue to do deep root watering all of  your plants.  And second, consider removing  any dead trees and shrubs because they are  potential FIRE HAZARDS!!  Articles over  the past year or two about NM fires indicate  that removing trees and shrubs around  residences is very important in preventing  wild fires.  If you cannot cut and remove  your dead trees and shrubs yourself, look at  the following list of Contractors that have  agreed to give Sandia Heights residents a  discount or special services to cut and  remove  trees & shrubs during August,  September, & October 2015. If the dead or  dying plants are on County rights-of-way  adjacent to your property, call the County  Hotline at 848-1503 and put in a work order  with them to remove trees, shrubs, &/or  Chamisa on the road rights-of-way adjacent  to your property.  Taking care of your dead and/or living  landscaping this summer & fall will help  maintain our property values and make  Sandia Heights a nicer place in which to  live.  Remember also that many Sandia  Heights Unit Covenants require prompt  removal of DEAD trees and shrubs. You  might just save yourself some Covenant  Violation headaches if you contact any of  these contractors now and get your dead or  dying trees & large shrubs removed in the  next few months.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type  of crime, along with the assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes  prevent break-ins and burglaries. Consider the following prevention tips as well as ways to  retrieve any lost or stolen property.       Each door should be metal or solid core with a deadbolt lock and a minimum 1” throw.   Short strike plate screws should be replaced with 3-4” screws that secure the plate into  the doorframe.  Doors should also be equipped with 180-degree eye viewers.  Consider  a security screen door.      Trim all bushes and shrubs below the window level and up from the ground.  Trim  mature trees up to a level 6-8 feet above ground.  Eliminate hiding places or areas that  allow someone the opportunity to enter through a window without being noticed.

Along with the rain  comes the growth of weeds and other  unwelcome plants. All of the Sandia  Heights covenants have wording that  addresses landscaping and natural  vegetation. While we value our  undisturbed natural vegetation, it is often  difficult to determine what is acceptable  landscaping, what is out of control weeds,  and what is just natural vegetation growth  spurred on by the wet weather.   The CSC tries to view all Units in the  same manner, handling complaints  accordingly. This may not satisfy  everyone. One person’s weeds are  another’s “mature landscape”. In  responding to complaints the CSC will try  to determine if any corrective action is  required. But the CSC is asking for your  help in maintaining the natural appearance  of Sandia Heights while keeping weeds  and extraordinary, unwanted growth in  check.   It is suggested that you look around your  Unit to see what others are doing. Does  your property stand out from the others  with dead plant material or excessive  outgrowth of weeds? Certainly, we can all  agree that dead trees and bushes should be  removed immediately. But if other non- native brush, trees or weeds, such as  Russian Thistle or other plants with an  unsightly appearance, are accumulating on  your property, be considerate of your  neighbors and take action to remove them.   It is not only unsightly but when they dry  out they will be a fire hazard to the entire  community.  SHHA is not a property manager. We are a  volunteer organization run by volunteers.   We charge very nominal dues and  homeowners are not required to join. We  do not “own” the covenants as they are  legal agreements that can only be changed  by individual Unit homeowners. While the  SHHA office maintains regular hours, the  volunteers are not on 24/7 duty; however,  we do try to respond to your concerns in a   timely manner. The system works best if  homeowners respect their neighbors’  rights, and if there is a violation, take  corrective action when they are made  aware of the problem.  We have limited  powers of enforcement, occasionally  requiring expensive legal action and time,  so please help us out by correcting issues  voluntarily.    The following is a summary of  active CSC violations at the  time of the June CSC meeting:  Unit  No.  Type of Violation  7  Home Maintenance, no prior  ACC approval   7, 27  Vehicle/Equipment Parking  9  Trash Cans  9  RV Parking  7, 8,  18, 27  Light Intrusion  7, 23,  25  Dead or Prohibited Trees, Dead  Vegetation  27  Trim color.

If you happen to  encounter a situation such as a broken or  clogged water or sewer line, repair or  replacement of your septic system, a leaky roof,  or any other situation where the urgency of the  issue requires quick action on your part in order  to prevent or minimize property damage, the  ACC does not want to stand in your way.  You  do not need to submit any sort of ACC  application form for these types of situations.   Just let the SHHA office know that you will be  tending to an emergency situation and, if  applicable, heavy equipment for excavations  may be required.  The phone number at the  SHHA office is 797-7793.  This information  will help the office answer questions from your  neighbors who may be inquiring about what is  going on at your residence.  Just as a reminder, be careful when selecting a  contractor to handle an emergency repair or for  any other repairs or modifications to your  residence.  There are many individuals looking  for business and some of these folks may not be  properly licensed or insured.  You bear the risk  of poor quality workmanship and a host of  other problems if you choose to use an  unlicensed or uninsured contractor.  I have  included articles in the GRIT on this subject  over the past several years so take some time  and familiarize yourself with just how to make  sure that your contractor is properly licensed  and insured before you “sign on the dotted  line”.  Don’t be a victim of an unlicensed or  uninsured contractor!  From all of the members of the ACC, we wish  you a great remainder of 2015 and please  remember that the Committee is here to help  you in any way we can through all phases of  your home improvement projects.   ‘Adwetsomera oo ot worsen an endorser by HHA  GREG LOBBEREGT ASSOCIATE BROKER, CRS ‘PROUDLY SERVING SANDIA HEIGHTS SINCE 1983" “SUNDIA HIFIGHTS RESIDENT ss: Gst@tntLona.coM ‘an 50 20.

Development News in Sandia Heights   By George Connor, Secretary  Panorama Homes Inc., John Lowe, president, has filed and posted a Bernalillo County (BC) zone  change request for the 10 acre Mhoon property at 900 Tramway Lane. This request is to change  the Zoning from A-1 to Residential (R-2).  R-2 zoning permits building apartments, townhomes,  multiple-family dwellings, and any R-1 zoning uses.   Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  (SHHA) has filed an opposition to this request, number Zcz-2015-0010, with BC. A hearing  before the BC Planning Commission is scheduled for Wednesday September 2, in the Vincent  Griego County Commission hearing room, basement of One Civic Plaza, City/County building.   Email comments may be sent to BC Planning manager Enrico Gradi, egradi@bernco.gov. The  SHHA letter sent to BC also referenced a similar zone change request for this property that was  denied by the County in 2007-2008. The SHHA letter is posted on the SHHA website under the  Notices and Alerts section:  https://sandiahomeowners.org/notices-and-information/notices-and-information  Notice: Any corrections to anything found in the printed version of this GRIT can be found on the website.
