      Parks and Safety ….3    ACC ….8    Community Bulletin ….11    c           December  2015                                                       Vol. 31 – No. 12             Happy Holidays   Mhoon Property R-2 Zone Change  Filed       A zone change to R-2 for the Mhoon Property,  891 Tramway Lane, has been filed by Panorama  Homes Inc. with Bernalillo County.  Current R-2  Zoning permits the property owner build 15  different allowable structures including  apartments, townhomes, multiple-family  dwellings, manufactured homes, cell towers, and  any other R-1 Zoning uses.  R-2 permits this  construction without a site plan.   Even if the  Mhoon Property is later sold, the new owners  are free to build any or all of the 15 allowable   R-2 structures without a site plan because zone  changes are forever associated with the property,  not the owner.  SHHA is filing a letter with the  County formally opposing this R-2 zone change.  What can members/residents do?   Show how  you feel in two different ways!    Send in your written comments about changing  the Mhoon Property at 891 Tramway Lane to  wholesale R-2 Zoning allowing many lots to be  built and developed inconsistent with other  Sandia Heights properties.   Reference BC ID  CZ2015-0013.  The deadline for input is  Monday Nov 23, 2015.  Send email comments  about R-2 Zoning to Mr. Enrico Gradi,  Bernalillo County Planning Manager at  zoning@bernco.gov    See “the list of 15 allowed  dwellings or structures in an R-2 Zone” and the  SHHA letter opposing the R-2 zone change in  the “SHHA letter to Bernalillo County Zoning”.   Both of these documents are on the SHHA  website under Notices and Alerts and are also  available in paper at the SHHA office.  Attend Planning Commission hearing  Wednesday December 2, in the Vincent Griego  County Commission hearing room, basement of  One Civic Plaza, City/County building at 9am,  item # is CZ2015-0013.   Sign-up, to speak  about the zone change or, say you agree with  other speakers & oppose the zone change to R-2.    Also tell you neighbors about this GRIT article,  ask them to send in an email, and invite them to  carpool with you to the hearing at 9am on   December 2, 2015.        SHHA Dues Holiday    At its August Board meeting the SHHA Board  of Directors voted to give its members a  holiday from the monthly dues for the months  of October and November.  Due to a billing  error, dues were collected for October.  Therefore, no dues will be collected for  November and December. This action was  made possible due to revenues being slightly  greater than budgeted, while expenses were  less than budgeted. If you are not a member,  consider joining (for a period of no less than  one year). The membership forms can be  found at the SHHA office and website at:  www.sandiahomeowners.org        2   The GRIT – December 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 12                                                                                                     Officers & Board  Members  President – Joe Pappe  Vice President – Josephine  Porter  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Woody Farber  Don Aunapu  Bob Bower  Anne Manning  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Emily Rudin  Marion Simon  Dick Wavrik  Bill Wiley      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor      SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org            For the GRIT Editorial Policy  please visit our website:  sandiahomeowenrs.org.

If you need maintenance on your  road/street, including snow removal, please  call the county at 848-1503. The county is  responsible for removing snow from the public  roads.        Parks & Safety Committee    By George Connor, Chairman    It is Property clean-up time again. We  recommend you start working now and be  prepared to take advantage of the following  FREE pick-up service from Sandia Peak  Utility.  Twice a year, Sandia Heights Services  Sanitation group offers a special Free Green  waste pick-up.  The 2015 GREEN WASTE  FALL pickup is scheduled on your regular  trash collection day during the week of  November 30th – December 4th. Place green  waste (leaves, grass and brush,   NO CACTI) in bags weighing 40 lbs. or less  at the curb by 7am on your regular trash  collection day.  Branches must be bundled and  cut down to 4 ft. lengths.  Limit 10 bags  and/or bundles.   Dead Tree Removal was mentioned by  multiple residents at past annual SHHA  meetings as being a neighborhood wide  problem.  This last summer and fall, the  SHHA Parks & Safety Committee arranged  with several landscaping companies to provide  discounts to SHHA residents utilizing their  services from August thru October, 2015.  The  Parks & Safety Committee Members  identified a base line of 30 properties across  Sandia Heights.  When we checked the  baseline in August there were 30 properties  with some 40+ dead trees or large shrubs on  the properties.   A check of these same 30  properties in late October showed that dead  trees & shrubs had been cut and debris  removed on a majority of these properties.  An  excellent result!  Thanks to every  owner/resident that did their part in making  our neighborhood look better by eliminating  dead trees and shrubs on their properties.     We still have a way to go to eliminate all dead  trees and shrubs in Sandia Heights.      The SHHA Covenants Support Committee  (CSC) has described in issues of this year’s  GRIT, how to submit covenant complaints.  If  any of your neighbors have dead trees or  shrubs on their lots, please file a covenant  complaint and let the CSC handle the dead  tree or shrub problem for you.     Office Closure  The office will be closed for the  holidays for one week from  December 24 through January 3. The  office will reopen on Monday,  January 4. Happy Holidays from the  SHHA office.     Bernalillo County Ordinance  regarding animals:  The Bernalillo County Ordinance No. 88-16  Section VI. E. states “Animal Nuisances on  Sidewalks, Public Parks, Alleys, and Other  Places Open to the Public. It is unlawful for  the owner of any animal to permit, either  willfully or through failure to exercise due  care of control, any such animal to commit  any nuisance upon the sidewalk or public  park; or upon the floor or wall of any common  hall in any multiple dwelling; or upon any  entrance way, stairway or wall immediately  abutting on a public sidewalk, or upon the  floor or wall of any theater, shop, store, office  building or other building used in common by  the public; or upon any private property other  than the owners of the animal.”   Leaving your pet(s) mess is not only unsightly  but also inconsiderate. Please be considerate  of your neighbors and pick up your pet(s)  waste material.     4   The GRIT – December 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 12                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash  and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate from  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

Here are some tips from the Sandia Heights Security  Patrol:   If you display your Christmas tree in a window, don’t put your presents under the tree where  they can be easily seen from the road.  This is an open invitation for a thief.   When you return home from holiday shopping, pull your car into the garage and close the  garage door before unloading your gifts from the trunk.  If it is not possible to do this, take a  look around before you unload the vehicle.   Never leave gifts in the trunk or back of your vehicle outside overnight.  If someone will go  to the trouble to steal your stereo or other valuables, they will certainly try to take items that  are on the backseat or in the trunk as well.   If you must leave vehicles parked in a driveway or on the street, remove the garage door  opener.     Contact the Sandia Heights Security Patrol for a special security watch if you are going to be  away from your home.  This service is available to security subscribers, so if you are not a  subscriber contact our office at 505-856-6419 to sign up today!                                                                    Judson McCollum Executive Broker 10 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-3717 JudsonABQ@aol.com Sharon McCollum Executive Broker 15 Million Dollar Producer (505) 269-6217 SMMinABQ@aol.com Selling Sandia Heights Homes!

Preliminary plans are the ones that are done  during the initial stages of the planning  process prior to the preparation of final (and  much more expensive) plans.  Review of  plans at the preliminary phase can identify  any problems with governing Unit  covenants or with any of the ACC Design  Guidelines related to the project.  This  “early” review will make it easier to correct  any compliance problems before incurring  further costs as you proceed towards the  preparation of final plans.  As a minimum,  these preliminary plans should contain the  floor plans, elevations, and the location of  the proposed structure on the lot.  It is also  advisable to include exterior materials,  colors, lighting, etc., if known at the time.  The ACC will point out what can and cannot  be approved based on the completeness of  the preliminary plans.  The applicant will be  encouraged to submit additional information  to address any inadequacies with the initial  submission of the preliminary plans in order  to avoid the risk of later disapproval of the  project.  Once the ACC gives its written  approval of the preliminary plans, you can  then proceed with the preparation of final  design and construction plans.  Two copies  of the final plans should accompany the  submission of another application for final  approval of the project, and these documents  will be used by the ACC to conduct a  neighborhood review of the project, if  needed, prior to the final approval of the  project.  Keep in mind that the ACC only  requires final drawings that show the overall  floor plan, the elevations, the location of the  proposed project on the lot, and any other  features that affect the external appearance  of the residence.  The ACC does not need  drawings showing such items as internal  electrical wiring, etc., that are not related to  what the external appearance of the project  will look like when completed.    Once the ACC approves the final  plans, you must keep the ACC fully  informed if you make any changes to these  plans, regardless of how trivial you may  think these changes are.  Such items as  changes to an exterior chimney design or  relocating an air conditioning unit from a  ground-mounted location to a location on  your roof or vice-versa need ACC approval  if these changes are not part of the originally  approved plans.  Experience has shown that  neighbors who have examined plans made  available to them during a neighborhood  review are especially sensitive to any  changes during construction that appear to  differ from the plans that they were invited  to review.  Bottom Line:  Keep the ACC in  the loop when planning and executing your  construction efforts—we will strive to make  the experience as problem-free as possible.      The following is a summary of active  CSC violations:    Unit No.  Type of Violation  7  Vehicle/Equipment  Parking  8  Light Intrusion  7, 1  Home maintenance  4, 11  Dead or Prohibited Trees,  Dead Vegetation    7 Files Closed in the Past Month     8   The GRIT – December 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 12                                                                                                       ACC Activity Log     Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.    2 Sandia Heights Drive – Reroof  8 Juniper Hill Loop – Door Replacement  16 Juniper Hill Loop - Landscaping  47 Pinon Hill Place – Porch Replacement  53 Rock Point Place – Deck and Window  Replacement  64 Juniper Hill Loop – Photovoltaic Panels  102 Juniper Hill Place – Patio and Wall  114 Whitetail Drive – Garage Door  Replacement  123Juniper Hill Road - Reroof  179 Big Horn Ridge Drive - Reroof  181 Juniper Hill Road – Deck Replacement  334 White Oaks Drive – Window Replacement  338 White Oaks Drive – Wall Height  361 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Window  Replacement  406 Live Oak Loop - Reroof  543 Black Bear Loop – Recoat Roof  564 Black Bear Road – Door Replacement  605 Cedar Hill- Windows and Door   639 Cougar Loop – Seal Coat Driveway  727-21 Tramway Lane – Concrete Pads  742 Tramway Lane - Reroof  750 Tramway Lane - Landscaping  785-7 Tramway Lane – Photovoltaic Panels  804 Tramway Lane - Reroof  884 Tramway Lane Court – Down Spouts  Installation  908 Tramway Lane - Restucco  912 Tramway Lane – Stucco Repair  979 Antelope Avenue – Reroof Porch and  Miscellaneous Projects  980 Antelope Avenue – Reroof and Stucco  Repair  1037 Red Oaks Loop - Reroof  1062 Red Oaks Loop – Garage Door  Replacement  1105 San Rafael Avenue – Retaining Wall  1229 Rockrose Drive - Reroof  1451 Honeysuckle Drive - Reroof  1482 Morning Glory Road - Restucco  1547 Eagle Ridge Road – Stucco and House  Repairs  1554 Eagle Ridge Lane – Re-Stucco   1903 Quail Run Drive - Reroof  1928 Quail Run Drive - Landscaping  2027 Quail Run Drive – Storm Door  2145 Black Willow Drive – Driveway and  Landscaping  2325 Calle de Gabriel - Reroof  2506 Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof and  Restucco  2818 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  2867 Tramway Circle – Roof Repair  2878 Brushwood Street – Window  Replacement  2879 Brushwood Street – Landscaping and  Playset  2893 Tramway Place – Repaint House Stucco  and Trim  8204 Indigo Court - Awning  8230 Raintree Drive – Landscaping and  Miscellaneous  8230 Raintree Drive - Reroof  12617 Colony Place – Door Replacement   -Asvessoment ont eraer an onartemant by SHH  4EXE'S the LIMy >A © REALTY “|  Serving Sandia Heights  The Jewel of Remodeling...  svard Winning Ss DesignBuld Contactor  Remodels  THE REAL ESTATE COUPLE WHO CARES!
