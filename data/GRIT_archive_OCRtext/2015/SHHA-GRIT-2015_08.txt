Jackson Park ~ George Connor, Secretary The SHHA Board of Directors notified the  County Commissioners that SHHA opposes the  recently selected artwork that the Bernalillo  County Arts Board wishes to locate at W.L.  Jackson Park on the corner of Tramway and  Cedar Hill in Sandia Heights.  The artwork  consists of Artist Christopher Weed’s  “Coneflower” design.  The SHHA BOD believes  the design is not in the spirit and harmony of the  SHHA community in that it does not reflect the  natural surroundings and detracts from the  natural beauty of Sandia Heights.   New Classified Ads:   Need yard work?

E. states “Animal  Nuisances on  Sidewalks, Public  Parks, Alleys, and Other Places Open to the  Public. It is unlawful for the owner of any  animal to permit, either willfully or through  failure to exercise due care of control, any such  animal to commit any nuisance upon the  sidewalk or public park; or upon the floor or  wall of any common hall in any multiple  dwelling; or upon any entrance way, stairway or  wall immediately abutting on a public sidewalk,  or upon the floor or wall of any theater, shop,  store, office building or other building used in  common by the public; or upon any private  property other than the owners of the animal.”    Leaving your pet’s mess is not only unsightly  but also inconsiderate. Please be considerate of  your neighbors and pick up your pet’s waste  material. 2   The GRIT – August 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 8                                                                                                       Officers & Board  Members  President – Joe Pappe  Vice President – Josephine  Porter  Secretary – George  Connor  Treasurer – Woody Farber  Don Aunapu  Bob Bower  Anne Manning  Meeko Oishi  Michael Pierce  Emily Rudin  Marion Simon  Dick Wavrik  Bill Wiley      Office Staff  Betsy Rodriguez – Administrative Assistant  Sheraz Saint-Lôt –  Administrator & Publications  & Communications Editor      SHHA Office   2-B San Rafael Avenue  Albuquerque, NM 87122  Office Hours: M-F, 9am-4pm  Phone: 505-797-7793  Fax: 505-856-8544  Web site:  www.sandiahomeowners.org  Email:  shha@sandiahomeowners.org            For the GRIT Editorial Policy  please visit our website:  sandiahomeowenrs.org.

All that  is needed is for the property owner to maintain membership in  SHHA. Many property owners mistakenly believe that if they  move from Sandia Heights and rent their house to another family,  they must cancel their membership in SHHA. Not true!    Membership dues will continue to be collected as part of the  monthly utility bill for that address, whether the property owner  pays the bill or the tenant pays the bill. If you as a property owner  pay the bill, you are free to pass along the cost of membership to  the tenant if you choose. Renters are eligible for all SHHA  membership benefits except voting privileges and filing covenant  violation complaints. Tram passes are among the most popular  member benefits, so be sure you maintain your membership so  your tenants can experience some of the great “perks” of living in  Sandia Heights!  Each merchant participating in the Member Benefits Program  offers a discount to SHHA members. To identify what  discounts each merchant offers visit the SHHA website at:   http://sandiahomeowners.org/notices-and-information/shha- member-benefits.

The Bernalillo County Code Section  66-225 states:  (h) Unobstructed vision for traffic safety shall  be strictly and solely maintained by the  property owner and occupant on all corner  lots, regardless of the zone classification, with  reference to any vehicle, trailer, sign, fence,  ornament, hedge, shrub, tree, display or any  other obstruction, but not including buildings.  No such obstruction to view between three  and eight feet above the gutter line shall be  placed or maintained within the clear sight  triangle which is a triangular area at the street  corner, which area is bounded by and  whichever is the lesser of:   (1) The curb lines of a street intersection and  a line extended to the curb lines connecting  points on the property lines 25 feet distant  from the intersection of the property lines of  the corner lot in such street intersection; or   (2) The curb lines of an intersection and line  connecting points 35 feet distant from the  corner of the intersection and such corner is  determined by projecting the curb lines out  to a specified point.   (i) Any owner, occupant or agent in charge  of all corner lots failing to comply with the  provisions of subsection (g), (h) and (i) of  this section, shall be liable to the county for  any claim or demand made upon the county  which arises from, either directly or  indirectly, the erection of, or failure to  maintain, any vehicle, trailer, sign, fence,  ornament, hedge, shrub, tree or display  which obstructs the clear sight triangle, or  which hides or obscures any official traffic  control device, railroad sign or signal. (Ord.  No. 96-2, §15, 3-12-96)   Parks & Safety Committee ~ By  George Connor, P&S Chair   Bicycles & skateboarders are with us in  Sandia Heights. Many bicyclists use  Tramway Blvd.  & Trail while others use  our narrow roads. We ask all residents to be  watchful: cars for bicyclists, bicyclists for  cars, and both for pedestrians. Just  remember that the visual image of a bicycle  or a pedestrian is much smaller than that of a  car or SUV. Also neighborhood speed limits  apply to both cars & bicycles. Skateboarding  on our County roads is allowed ONLY if the  skateboarders comply with the same rules as  pedestrians (according to Traffic Ordinance  82-1 plus an interpretation of it from a BC  Deputy). There is one skateboarding park  nearby: it is the North Domingo Baca Skate  Park on Wyoming, two blocks north of  Paseo Del Norte.   There are more children playing in our  neighborhood in the summer. Please be  watchful for pedestrians of all ages as we  drive around and through Sandia Heights.    We have many signs in and around Sandia  Heights. In general, these signs are of an  informational or regulatory nature. Most of  the signs along the roads are on County  property/easements. They are placed there  pursuant to County ordinances or State or  Federal regulations. There is always a  conflict between already having enough  signs or needing more signs. Because of the  semi-rural nature of our neighborhood, and  desire to keep it that way, both your Sandia  Heights Homeowners Association and the  County road department strive to have the  right balance of information and safety  signage.   4   The GRIT – August 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 8                                                                                                      SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop:     Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (which provides water, sewer,  trash and recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service  separate from Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

Homeowners who are willing to take certain steps to prevent this type of crime, along with the  assistance of local law enforcement, can reduce and sometimes prevent break-ins and burglaries.   Consider the following prevention tips as well as ways to retrieve any lost or stolen property.       Establish trusted relationships with neighbors on your block.  Agree to watch out for each  other and report any suspicious activity in and around your home.  Remember, residential  burglaries statistically occur during the day, so if possible, identify trusted neighbors who  might be home during this time.         Evaluate your existing lighting and pay particular attention to access points such as entry/exit  doors and windows.  Make sure that each area has adequate illumination so that your  neighbors can see any suspicious activity occurring on your property.  Consider adding  motion sensors to lights in remote areas around the home.

No prior ACC  approval  9  Trash Cans  S1, 6,  10  RV parking  8, 18,  27  Light intrusion  7, 25  Dead or Prohibited Trees  27C  Trim color. No prior ACC  approval   Most of the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants  address light pollution in order to preserve  the enjoyment of the night sky. Regardless  of the individual covenants for your Unit,  the entire North Albuquerque Acres and  Sandia Heights fall under the Bernalillo  County Code for light pollution. The code  includes, but is not restricted to, security  lighting, street lights, landscape lights,  building mounted area lights, building  façade lights. In general, outdoor lights shall  remain OFF between 11:00 pm and sunrise;  be equipped with light and motion sensors  or automatic timing devices; be mounted no  higher than 16 feet; and lights must be  shielded so the light is directed  perpendicular to the ground.    To see the entire code and for exceptions, go  to the Bernalillo County Website  (www.bernco.gov) and look under  Ordinances, Section 30-186. If you leave  your lights on, after 11:00 pm and they are  not shielded, not on motion detectors and  not directly illuminating walkways or  driveways, they may be in violation of the  County Code. While the CSC does not  enforce County ordinances, we will work  with folks to make them aware of the  options and try to get resolution. At night,  even a 40 watt bulb in an unshielded fixture  can be a distraction to those that wish to  enjoy the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city  below.              The SHHA CSC investigates all member  complaints concerning potential covenant  violations and follows rigorously adhered to  procedures, (see the SHHA website for a  description of procedures).     Surveys and Building Permits  — a Refresher ~ By Bob Bower, ACC  Chairman  When you are planning a major exterior  remodel of your residence, the ACC will  require a plat plan of your property showing  the location of your residence and associated  structures within the boundaries of your  property.  This plat plan (a property survey  performed by a licensed surveyor) will give  the ACC an idea of what your setback  distances are with respect to the existing  structures and, in particular, how your  proposed exterior remodels will affect those  setback distances.  You should have a copy  of a survey that was done when your  residence was purchased—this document is  part of the package you received when you  took formal possession of your home. If you  do not have a current property survey you  can follow the link below to view recorded  documents and to order documents.  The  County will also walk you through the  process if you call them or visit them.    Continued on Page 8  8   The GRIT – August 2015 – Volume 31 – No. 8                                                                                                      Continued from page 7  You have three options for purchasing the  documents as listed below:  Option 1:  Order online at  http://eagleweb.bernco.gov/recorder/web/.   Follow the instructions on the menu.  Your  request will be emailed to you within 24 hours.   The fee is $1.00 per page and $1.49 convenience  fee per order.  Option 2:  You can order by mail to Bernalillo  County Clerk’s Office at P.O. Box 542,  Albuquerque, NM 87103-0542. Call their phone  number at 505-468-1238 regarding fees, etc.   Option 3:  You can visit the Bernalillo County  Clerk’s Office at One Civic Plaza NW, 6th Floor- Room 6029.  The building is located at the  southeast corner of 5th and Marquette NW.  If you have trouble with any of these options,  Elaine Kapuscinski, Senior Records Technician,  can be contacted directly.  She can be reached at  505-468-1238.  Now, a short essay on building permits.  These  permits are not needed for home improvements  that are largely cosmetic such as painting, tiling,  flooring and carpeting.  A minor kitchen  remodel--new cabinets and countertops--won’t  need a permit unless fixtures are relocated or the  space is reconfigured.  Permits will be needed if  an addition is built onto the house, if electrical  and mechanical work is involved, and for most  plumbing jobs.  Licensed contractors should know when a permit  is required. Using a licensed contractor who is  issued proper permits and requests required  inspections will give the homeowner some  confidence that the construction is code  compliant.  The ACC does not get involved in the  permitting process with the County.  Once a  project is approved by the ACC, it is up to the  homeowner and his/her contractor to obtain the  required permits.    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   4 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  26 Sandia Heights Drive – Photovoltaic Panels  32 Juniper Hill Road – Photovoltaic Panels  67 Pinon Hill Place – Replace Deck and Fascia  174 Big Horn Ridge Road – Repaint House and  Trim and Re-stain Fence  184 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Door Replacement  305 Big Horn Ridge Place - Landscaping  357 Juniper Hill Road – Reroof  367 Big Horn Ridge Road – Window  Replacement  446 Live Oak Loop – Recoat Roof  505 Black Bear Loop – Re-stain Trim  623 Cedar Hill Road – Reroof  711-36 Tramway Place - Awnings  727-20 Tramway Lane – Two Patios  1167 Laurel Loop – HVAC Unit  1176 Laurel Loop – Patio Repair  1556 Eagle Ridge Road – Pergola and  Miscellaneous Projects  1711 Quail Run Court – Remodel  1845 Tramway Terrace Loop - Reroof  1861 Tramway Terrace Loop – Restucco  1929 Quail Run Drive – Garage Door  Replacement  2006 Quail Run Drive – Restucco and Raise Wall  2007 Quail Run Drive – Restucco  2155 Black Willow Drive – Door Replacement  2313 Calle de Rafael – Restucco  2801 Tramway Circle – Repaint Trim and Garage  Door and Restucco  7726 Cedar Canyon Court - Reroof  8213 Indigo Court – Driveway Replacement  Go to the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org    to read about all projects currently under ACC  management.   | The Jewel of | Remodeling...
