Continued on page 2        NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT: FOURTH IN A SERIES  Joe Pappe    In each issue of The GRIT since August, I have shared with you, our  members, my concerns about the future of our Association. My  columns have recounted the benefits of having a strong and active  Association, most significantly SHHA’s protection of the value of your  property through the enforcement of our covenants and the control of  the community’s architectural standards. I want to re-emphasize that  SHHA is an organization of volunteers, and that voluntary service is  the key ingredient for sustaining our collective investment in one of  Albuquerque’s most sought-after communities.      When beginning my series of columns in August, I was very concerned  that within several months we would not have enough volunteers to fill  Board positions projected to be vacant in 2018. As it is currently  structured, the Association must have a minimum of 11 Board  members in order to conduct business and carry out our responsibility  to exercise ordinary care of our membership. I was so concerned, in  fact, that I sought legal counsel about the steps required should SHHA  need to be dissolved, and about the intended and unintended  consequences of such action. I was informed that dissolution of a  nonprofit organization like SHHA would be a long and difficult  process.    As you know, our Bylaws give us the flexibility to adjust the  composition of our Board and of our committees, should the need  arise. Between now and our Annual Meeting in February, the Board  will be evaluating options to modify our Bylaws. Exercising our ability  to consider alternatives for the best interests of SHHA is certainly the  preferred action to take at this time, in order to avoid dissolution.    I am pleased to report that the membership’s response to my first  three GRIT articles has been modestly positive. A number of you have  volunteered for positions on our Board and on our committees. We  will be welcoming all new Board members in the December GRIT. We  thank each of them for offering to step up on behalf of our community.  Our Nominating Committee is busy interviewing these members. I am  confident that enough volunteers will be both willing and able to  assume the responsibilities of Board and committee membership to  sustain the Association through the remaining business year.

Continued from front page  2   The GRIT – November 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 11                                                                           I ask for your attendance and support at our Annual Meeting on February 17, 2018, to approve any  potential changes to our Bylaws which the Board might propose for a membership vote, with the goal  of preventing the possibility of dissolution in the future. We have been a built-out community for many  years. As such, it is time to assess whether the Association might function most effectively with a  smaller Board, along with changes to our committees. These options will be part of our discussions  with you at the Annual Meeting.         A Review of How the Architectural  Control Committee (ACC) Works  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    If you are planning a home improvement  project that will alter the external appearance, you  are required to submit an application to the ACC.  Please note that even if you plan to replace items  using existing materials and colors, such as stucco  or roofing materials, the ACC still needs to review  your application for these “in-kind” changes. That  said, the initial step in planning your project should  be to review and understand your unit covenants.  You need to be aware of your property setback  distances and of any other features specified in your  covenants that can affect your project. The ACC  also has Design Guidelines to assist you in  planning.  After you have done your homework, go  ahead and submit your application. You can select  an appropriate contractor either before or after the  ACC approves your application. The ACC reviews  about 300 applications each year. Many involve  routine requests for re-roofing, re-stuccoing,  window and/or door replacements, heating and air  conditioning system upgrades, simple landscaping,  etc. These projects are usually administratively  approved by the chairman within a few days. More  complex projects, such as room or garage additions  and larger-scale landscaping, might need additional  time for review. The ACC will assign one of its  members to work with you on these types of  projects. It might also elect to gather relevant  comments from your neighbors concerning impacts  to their properties which could result from your  project. On these more complex projects, the ACC  strongly advises you to take advantage of its review  at the early (preliminary) design stage, before you  commit to a final design. You might find out that  some aspects of your design would not be approved  by the ACC and it is best to find this out at the  beginning of the design process.  One item you are advised to provide, which  really helps the ACC to understand your project,  particularly if it involves major construction, is a  plat plan or survey that shows the location of your  house and of the proposed project relative to your  property lines. The property survey that you  received with your property deed at closing will  usually be sufficient for this purpose.  The ACC will work hard to expedite your  application, but we need adequate time to do our  job of reviewing your project. Remember that  starting a project before you receive the ACC’s  written approval is a violation of your covenants.  With a bit of planning, you can avoid this risk.  Come talk to us if you need our advice on any of  your projects—large or small.      We Want to Hear From You!  By Bob Bower, SHHA Secretary    The SHHA Bylaws (Section 6.7) require that Board  meetings be open to all of our members. Come join  us—we want to hear your comments and concerns.  The Board meets the second Wednesday of every  month at 7 pm at the SHHA Office. The meetings  last about an hour. You can stay for part or all of  the meeting. You will be first on the agenda if you  want to speak! Out of courtesy, just let the Office  staff know that you want to attend. The Board will  try its best to address your questions and concerns.  During my time as a member of the Board, I have  rarely seen any of our members attend Board  meetings. These meetings are your chance for the  Board to get to know you and vice versa.  Take  advantage of the opportunity to talk to us about  your issues—we aim to serve you as best we can,  but need to know what’s on your mind.  Don’t wait  until the Annual Meeting in February to voice your  concerns—we are available to listen to you any time  during the year.    3   The GRIT – November 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 11                                                                                                    Don’t Let Your Water Pipes Freeze!  By Bob Bower, Chairman, ACC    I heard a couple of horror stories from last  winter, so once again it’s time for my annual  article on how to prevent your  water pipes from freezing.   It’s too early to tell if  Albuquerque’s winter of 2017- 2018 will be really cold or not,  but it’s always a good time to  remind you of ways to protect  your water pipes from the  effects of very cold weather.  Most local experts on this  subject generally agree that  steps need to be taken to  protect water pipes if  temperatures are expected to  drop below 21o F. A broken  water pipe inside your home  can cause a lot of extensive and expensive damage!  Let’s start with the outside of your home.  Disconnecting water hoses and protecting outdoor  water faucets are very important. Water that  freezes in outdoor hoses connected to faucets  causes a buildup of pressure on interior plumbing,  which can result in a rupture of the interior pipes  if the pressure is too high. Damage to these  interior pipes near an outdoor water faucet is often  difficult to repair due to their inaccessibility.  Disconnecting hoses from these outdoor faucets  and protecting the faucets with hard foam  insulating cups are good ways to reduce the  chances of damage to these water pipes that  extend through your exterior walls. These  inexpensive foam cups can be purchased at home  improvement or hardware stores and are easy to  install. I’ve also found it wise to wrap outdoor  faucets with some insulation prior to placing the  foam cup over the faucets, particularly if any of the  faucets are located on the north side of your home  or are located in an area that does not receive any  winter sunshine. Also, if you have any water pipes  located outside your home that are exposed to  outside temperatures, you should consider using  insulating tubes or heat tape around them.  Now let’s consider the inside of your home. If  Albuquerque experiences a spell of extremely cold  weather where temperatures, particularly at night,  drop below the 21oF “benchmark,” leave the water  supply line on at a very slow drip rate somewhere  inside your home. Water in slow motion is much  less likely to freeze than water that is motionless  inside a pipe. Normally, a faucet located far away  from where the water enters your home is the one  that you should use for this purpose. The  cost of water used is insignificant  compared to the cost of repairing damage  caused by a broken water line inside your  home. These very cold spells usually don’t  last long, so leaving an indoor faucet  dripping for a few days and nights should  get you through these spells until warmer  temperatures return. If you are away from  your home during the cold season, make  sure there is adequate heat inside your  home to prevent internal pipes from  freezing. Even when trying to save energy  costs, don’t turn the heat too far down  (experts recommend no lower than 55o F)  and don’t turn the heat off altogether unless you  have all of the water lines properly drained.  Believe me, I have seen the damage caused by  pipes that were not properly drained and then  burst inside the home where the heat was turned  off!  One final note for those of you who have  swamp coolers. If you have not already done so, be  sure to drain the water reservoir and disconnect  and drain the water supply line. It doesn’t take  much of a freeze to damage these cooler  components. Have a great winter!!

Don't try to  store them in your backyard, hoping your  neighbors will not see them. If you can afford  to own expensive toys and live in Sandia  Heights, then consider off-site storage as the  cost of ownership. You chose to live in an  area with covenants, but about 10% of our  homeowners feel that surely these covenants  do not apply to them. The CSC does not  patrol looking for violations, but will follow  up on signed, written complaints from your  neighbors.      Weeds and Landscaping  By Dick Wavrik, CSC Chairman    We had a very wet July and early August. Along  with the rain came growth of weeds and plants.  All Units’ covenants have wording that address  landscaping and natural vegetation. However,  many Unit residences have differing opinions on  what is acceptable landscaping, what are out-of- control weeds, and what is natural vegetation  growth spurred on by the wet weather.  It is the  position of the CSC that we will not customize  our enforcement to specific  Units, nor interpret  what a developer  might have meant by  “landscaping.” We try  to view all Units in  the same manner and  to handle complaints  accordingly. This of  course might not  satisfy everyone. One  person’s weeds are another’s “mature  landscape.”  In responding to complaints, the  CSC will try to determine if any corrective action  is required.      We suggest you look around your Unit to see  what others are doing. If you can’t see past your  front door, that might be an indication of tall  weeds or out-of-control growth needing prompt  maintenance.      SHHA is not a property manager.    SHHA is a volunteer organization run by  volunteers. We charge very nominal dues and  homeowners are not required to join unless  stipulated by your covenants. We do not “own”  the covenants, as they are legal agreements that  can be changed only by individual Unit  homeowners (there are no overall SHHA  umbrella covenants). While the SHHA Office  maintains regular hours, our volunteers are not  on 24/7 duty. We do, however, try to respond to  your concerns in a timely manner. The system  works well if homeowners respect their  neighbors’ rights and, if there is a violation, take  corrective action when made aware of a problem.  We have limited powers of enforcement–usually  requiring expensive legal action and time. So  please help us by correcting issues voluntarily.        Dying Pinons in Sandia Heights  By Robert Trucksa, Sandia Heights Resident    Many pinon trees are turning brown. Some think  this is a water problem. It is not. It is a fungus.  The wind sends it from one tree to another. Just  drive up Live Oak and adjacent streets. It first  infects the tips of branches and then spreads. If  you have driven along I-40 near Flagstaff, you  will see miles of dying trees. I am told there is no  effective  fungicide, and  that the only  effective  action is to cut  affected  branches  quickly. I have  a pinon in  front of my  house that I planted 35 years ago. For the last  two years, I have been cutting off a branch at a  time. The disease stops, then from one of the  infected trees nearby, the wind sends more  fungus, and I trim a few more branches. Being  thus vigilant will help minimize the impact of  this fungus in Sandia Heights.  8   The GRIT – November 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 11                                                                                                   ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:  304 Big Horn Ridge Place – Reroof and Deck   518 Black Bear Loop – Photovoltaic Panel   652 Cougar Loop - Landscaping  676 Black Hawk Drive – Landscaping  687 Black Hawk Drive – Retaining Wall  801 Tramway Lane – Reroof and Replace  Skylights  910 Tramway Lane – Color Coat Stucco  1179 Laurel Loop – Garage Extension  2020 Quail Run Drive – Landscaping and Misc.  2413 Tramway Terrace Court – Restucco  8250 Raintree Drive – Lattice Cover  12614 Colony Place – Restucco and Paint Trim  and Garage    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.    A Note from the Vice President –  Emily Rudin  New Security Signs Posted in  Sandia Heights    Many SHHA residents will recall the series of four  meetings in 2016 concerning crime in Sandia  Heights and vicinity. SHHA co-sponsored those  held on May 12 and October 13 with the Bernalillo  County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO). A third meeting on  October 18 was sponsored by Citizens for Safety— Far Northeast Heights, and was organized by  SHHA members Jim and Denise Dobier. The  fourth meeting on October 26 was organized by  John Betak, president of the Alliance of Sandia  Heights Neighborhoods, with participation by  Sandia Heights Services (SHS).  My predecessor, Bob Bower, attended all of these  meetings and reported on them in the December  2016 GRIT  ( http://sandiahomeowners.org/grit- newsletter?task=download&file=grit_upload_file &id=497353).  These meetings were prompted by residents’  concerns about rising crime, based on personal  experiences and media coverage. BCSO and SHS  presented data showing that the Far Northeast  Heights is one of the safest areas in the County.  Still, they noted, crime was increasing.  In response to the community’s concerns, SHHA’s  Parks and Safety (P&S) Committee began  evaluating options for enhancing security. One  approach came from our residents, who suggested  installing signage to warn people entering Sandia  Heights that it is monitored by security patrols.  This year, P&S began to implement this option, in  partnership with SHS and with Rodney Baldonado  of the County’s Public Works Division.    We’re pleased to announce that as of mid- September, eight new signs reading “AREA  PATROLLED BY SECURITY” have been installed.  You will find them at the following locations:  1. Eastbound Tramway Rd. E of Tramway Blvd.  2. Eastbound Tramway La. E of Tramway Blvd.  3. Eastbound Cedar Hill Rd. E of Tramway Blvd.  4. Eastbound Live Oak Rd. E of Tramway Blvd.  5. Eastbound Tramway Terrace Pl. E of Tramway Blvd.  6. Eastbound San Rafael Ave. E of Tramway Blvd.  7. Westbound San Rafael Ave. W of Tramway Blvd.  8. Westbound Tramway Terrace W of Tramway Blvd.  SHHA is responsible for maintaining these signs.  We thank the County and SHS for their  collaboration in getting this important project  done for the benefit of our residents.  9 The GRIT - November 2017 - Volume 33 - No. 11 10 The GRIT - November 2017 - Volume 33 - No. 11 11   The GRIT – November 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 11            Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org  Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
