    “    Joint SHHA/SHS Statement on Outdoor Lighting    Among the many pleasures of residing in Sandia Heights are the dark skies  which allow stargazing, watching the moon rise over the mountains, and  enjoying the distant sparkling night lights of Albuquerque. This was a  quality-of-life issue for the original developers of Sandia Heights and these  activities are possible today, some 40+ years later, in large part because of  regulations contained in our Sandia Heights Unit Covenants that apply to  light pollution.    Today, it is increasingly evident that some of our residents are “lighting up”  the outside of their properties for the purpose of enhancing security. The  Sandia Heights Unit Covenants do not address security and security-related  issues that can affect the neighborhood such as alarms, outdoor cameras,  outdoor lighting, and other methods intended to deter home invasions. The  Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) and Sandia Heights  Security (SHS) have jointly agreed that taking measures to secure one’s  home is important, so long as these measures are within the bounds of the  Unit Covenants.  “Lighting up” is not necessarily the best deterrent and, as  recently determined by analyses of national crime statistics, most home  burglaries occur during daylight hours and alarms, cameras, dogs, and  having a TV or radio turned on can be effective deterrents. SHHA asks that  all residents be aware of and follow the Unit Covenants for light pollution  and the Bernalillo County Ordinance for Light Pollution. The specific County  ordinance for North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights is quite  restrictive regarding outdoor lighting, and the County takes a serious  approach to its enforcement.    SHHA asks that, when planning the installation of new outdoor lighting or  replacing your current outdoor lighting, in addition to consulting the  regulations mentioned above, you think about the impact of your outdoor  lighting on your neighbors. Will the lights shine into their windows or onto  their patio? A little consideration can prevent a complaint to SHHA’s  Covenant Support Committee and/or to Bernalillo County. We have a  beautiful and unique neighborhood, and we are working to maintain and  insure for the future that the original concept envisioned for our community  continues to minimize the impact on our natural environment.  If you have questions, please contact the SHHA office at 797-7793 or visit  the SHHA website at sandiahomeowners.org.

Uh…not quite. But it is high season to be out and  about on foot or on wheels. In Sandia Heights, we  have amazing opportunities to recreate not far  from our front doors. But most of our streets lack  sidewalks, bike lanes, and crosswalks. Herewith,  some friendly pointers to keep us all aware and all  safe:      School is out and our kids are too. Drivers  and cyclists, please be continuously alert for  height-challenged enthusiasts at play whom  you might not see around the bend or  impulsively crossing the street. Kids and  cyclists, play your music at a low enough  volume to hear traffic and warning bells  behind and in front of you.    Sightlines need to be open. Our foothills  roads twist and turn. Although Bernalillo  County is responsible for maintaining our  streets and edges, homeowners should be  proactive in keeping vegetation clear along  the shoulders adjacent to your property.  And our dedicated U.S. Mail carriers would  be most grateful if you prune plants well  away from your mailbox on all sides.    Many of our streets feature two- and four- way stop signs. No matter how familiar you  are with these intersections on your daily  rounds, Stop means STOP. Always. Every  time. Make sure your car wheels actually  stop moving before proceeding.    Lots of us walk dogs. County ordinance  requires that dogs always be on leashes,  especially on trails, in arroyos, and even in  our own driveways. Drivers and cyclists,  please look for dogs and their people, and  courteously share the space.    Speed is no one’s friend. Drivers, please  keep your speed down to 25 mph or less, as  posted, at all times and yield to non-drivers.  It’s the law.    Cyclists, walkers, scooter- and skateboard- riders, and stroller-pushers need to be  exceedingly careful also. Remember that  you are always at a disadvantage with respect to  cars and trucks. Those on foot should stay to the  far left of the road, facing oncoming traffic.  Those on wheels should hug the right shoulder,  with traffic.    Everyone, please be both visible and predictable.  For non-drivers, a reflective vest makes a huge  difference any time of day. Pick one up at the  SHHA Office for just $2.    Never, ever use a hand-held device to talk or text  while driving. It’s the law. Non-drivers, know  that your being distracted can endanger you,  too, so be cautious.    Come to think of it, mindfully observing these  practices is smart any time of year! Your safety is  paramount to the pleasure of living in Sandia  Heights. Thank you.                                          HELP US HELP YOU!    Do you have a skill?

Sandia Mountain Bear  Watch        •  Keep trash in a bear-proof garbage container or  stored in a sturdy metal shed or closed garage.  Put out garbage only on the morning of pickup.  •  Don’t feed pets outdoors or leave pet dishes or  store pet food outdoors.  •  Hang seed feeders from wires between trees high  enough off the ground that a bear can’t reach it.  Bring in hummingbird feeders at night. Offer suet  and peanut butter only in winter, when bears are  in hibernation. Store birdseed in a closed  container in a sturdy shed or the garage.  •  Keep barbeque grills clean.  •  Keep kitchen windows and doors closed on  summer nights.  •  Don’t plant fruit trees or berry bushes near your  home. Remove fruit before it ripens to stop bears  from climbing and breaking branches. Remove  fallen fruit. Don’t add melon rinds or fruit to  compost piles, except in winter.  •  Don’t leave food, groceries, pet food, or birdseed  in your car overnight.  •  Don’t feed other wildlife, as it will attract bears  too.  •  If a bear is drinking from your swimming pool or  hot tub, put water out as far from your house and  neighbors’ homes as possible.  •  Keep all poisons inside your house; also, many  bears die from ingesting garbage bags.  •  Keep woodpiles and junk away from the house.  Bears will hunt for rodents that live there.  •  Please understand that a trapped bear does not  transplant well. There are no pristine,  unpopulated relocation areas left in New Mexico.  A large percentage of bears die from being  relocated.

From handling complaints from  your neighbors, it is apparent that a lot of folks are  unaware that they agreed to abide by legally  enforceable covenants when they rented or bought  their homes. Even if they understand that there are  covenants, they sure didn't read them. (I would hate  to think that you would disrespect your neighbors  by ignoring your covenants!)  If you are not sure  what your covenants say, stop by the SHHA Office  for a copy or look them up on the SHHA website.    This brings us to weeds (especially if you have  gravel in your front yard). Weeds seem to grow by  inches overnight. If you don't keep up with them,  they get overwhelming. Instead, treat them like  eating an elephant (a little at a time): you won't have  to resort to an herbicide for letting your property go  to seed. Again, it's a good-neighbor thing--keeping  all of our property values up.    Enforcement of Covenants    The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) often  receives complaints which are annoyances, safety  issues, or nuisances. Sometimes these involve  enforcement of County codes or ordinances (such as  barking dogs, traffic, parking on the street, and non- floodlight lighting).  When you file these complaints  with the CSC, we do investigate them, but you might  get a letter instructing you to contact the County for  enforcement.  The CSC does not have the authority  or ability to handle many of these issues.   Please understand that SHHA is not a property- management organization.      The CSC is staffed by resident volunteers (in  addition to our hard-working Office staff), and we  currently have very few people who want to help us  by serving on our committee. So it often takes longer  for the CSC to do investigations and resolve issues.  Making our job more complex is the existence of 35  different sets of covenants, one for each Unit. They  are far from perfect. Only the owners in each Unit,  however—not SHHA--can change them.    Speaking of the Office staff: when you come to the  Office, we know that sometimes you might be  frustrated and want something done about your  problem now. But please don't take your  frustrations out on the staff. Try to be respectful;  they are there to be helpful and not to be abused.

We  meet bimonthly in small groups in our members’ homes. Each small group is usually three couples plus a  host couple, with each couple contributing to part of the dinner menu. All couples and singles are welcome.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance. We’re always happy to have new folks join us,  so if this sounds like an activity that interests you, please contact Linda Mason at lindamason307@gmail.com  or 505-554-2934.
