                  WELCOME NEW SHHA BOARD MEMBERS!  By Emily Rudin, Vice President and Nominating Committee Chair    I am very pleased to announce that nine volunteers have joined  SHHA’s Board of Directors during October and November.    Beginning with the August 2017 GRIT, SHHA president Joe Pappe has  written a monthly series of front-page columns, urgently calling for  new volunteers to serve on the Board of Directors and committees. The  situation was dire. As recently as mid-October, Board membership fell  to 11, the minimum number our Bylaws stipulate in order to transact  business. We have been pleasantly surprised by the number of  members who have offered to step up in order to serve our  community.    I wish to emphasize that it is not simply a matter of gaining a robust  number of Board members, although we have achieved this goal.  Rather, our new volunteers bring experience from many walks of life,  represent many units within Sandia Heights, and have expressed a  commitment to our explicit request for new ideas, a collaborative  approach, and—crucially—a willingness to follow up with action.  These criteria will, I believe, best benefit our community as we turn  our attention to future priorities for serving the Association. It is thus  my fervent hope that the collective experience and efforts of these new  Board members, together with those of our entire Board, will enable  SHHA to enhance our responsiveness and service to our members.    Our newest Board members are: Stephen Baca, George Chen, Judy  Durzo, Walter Forman, Cheryl Iverson, Martin Kirk, Phil Krehbiel,  Craig Newbill, and Travis Rich.    I would like to thank the members of my Nominating Committee, Bob  Bower and Woody Farber. All three of us wear many hats within SHHA  and have worked very hard as a team to strengthen both the number  and the caliber of Directors on the Board. I am grateful to my  committee members who have given generously of their time and  intellect in interviewing candidates. Most especially, thanks to all of  you who have offered your support at a time when that support has  never been more critical. We look forward to working with you on  behalf of all our members.

By Susan Seligman, CSC Member    PLEASE DO NOT STORE THEM ON YOUR  PROPERTY!    Trailers, commercial trucks, boats and RVs  parked on your property are against Sandia  Heights covenants. Please help keep Sandia  Heights beautiful by removing or storing your  vehicles.      TIRED OF SEEING PARKED-VEHICLE  VIOLATIONS IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?    We do not patrol Sandia Heights for violations,  but we see them all over our community. We  can only act if you file a complaint, citing the  violation for your unit. You can find the  complaint form, along with the specific  covenants on our website, at  www.sandiahomeowners.org. If you have  questions, please call the Sandia Heights Office  at 797-7793. We DO NOT reveal your name  when you file a complaint.    With your help, we can make a difference in our  community.

If there is too much for your recycle bin,  paper and boxes can be taken to the Eagle Rock  transfer station (no charge for the outside bin  use) or places like the Sonic/Lowes on Juan  Tabo. Remember that your trash bins need to be  out of sight except on the pick-up day.  How to Really Enjoy Our Wonderful  Fall Temperatures  By Marion Simon, CSC Member    When summer finally comes to an end, a  lot of us Sandia Heights residents like to take  walks around the neighborhood. The  temperatures are finally cooler, the air feels  fresher, and we want to get out before it gets too  cool and uncomfortable for walking. We have  such a lovely area, but no sidewalks. The rules  for walking in our area are a little different from  the City and can be a little more hazardous.  Please walk on the LEFT side, facing traffic! We  have a lot of little hills and curves with LIMITED  SIGHT DISTANCE. Motorists as well as  pedestrians need to be cautious, and to see the  danger coming, pedestrians must FACE traffic!  Sometimes young mothers with baby carriages  walk on the right side and unfortunately don't  see danger approaching from behind, which  might be disastrous.    Walking on the left-hand side to face  traffic helps us step out of the way in time. So,  remember to trim the vegetation on your  property at least 2 feet from the road to allow for  pedestrians to get out of the way of vehicles  especially trucks that take up more than half of  the road. Be safe and enjoy our beautiful  neighborhood and weather. After all, that is  what made us choose this neighborhood.

Any of  these could cause short circuits.     Don’t overload your string sets. Check the  instructions on the package to find out how  many light sets can be connected to each  other.     Avoid overloading circuits. Most home circuits  can take 15 amps, or 1,800 watts.     Cover each outdoor plug and connector joint  with plastic wrap to protect it from rain and  seal it with electrical tape.     If you use staples instead of tape to secure  lights, be sure that they’re insulated staples.     Make sure decorations pose no danger to  children or pets. Don’t leave cords dangling  or strung loosely on the floor or stairs.                SNOW REMOVAL  Most of the roads within Sandia Heights are County  roads/streets; there are a few private roads. If you  need maintenance on your road/street, including  snow removal, please call the County at 848-1503.  The County is responsible for removing snow from  the public roads.    BEWARE: DON’T USE RODENT  POISON ON YOUR PROPERTY!   Submitted by SHHA Members    Some property-owners in Sandia Heights  are installing outdoor rodent bait traps. This  method of pest control can be detrimental to the  environment because of the indiscriminate nature  of its ability to kill animals other than the rodents  which it targets. After ingesting enough poison in  these traps, the rodents will die and might be  consumed by larger wildlife, which will in turn  become ill from the poison.   Predatory birds, such as hawks and owls,  are particularly susceptible to secondary  poisoning and often die as a result. These birds  are precisely the predators who keep the rodent  population down, as are coyotes and bobcats,  which might also eat poisoned rodents. Your pets  are vulnerable, too: poisoned rodents will not die  next to the bait traps on your property, but will  travel to other yards where they will possibly die  and be eaten by cats and dogs.  SHHA does not recommend poisoning  rodents, due to risks of environmental  contamination. We recommend keeping your  property clean and free of rats’ nests and  trapping and removing rodents. The GRIT has  published articles about the dangers of  poisoning. As a resident, if you decide to use bait  traps, you are responsible for promptly picking  up and disposing of all dead animals on your  property; informing all of your surrounding  neighbors of your use of bait traps; and knowing  the specific poison used in the traps, so that,  should a pet become ill, an antidote can be  administered quickly.  Many residents chose to live in Sandia  Heights because of opportunities to see wildlife  and appreciate an environment outside the city.  Your choice of pest control should not destroy  what others appreciate most. Please be  considerate.  SHHA hosted its Annual Volunteer Appreciation  Luncheon at El Patron Restaurant on October 21.  On behalf of SHHA, Vice President Emily Rudin  commended and thanked the member volunteers  who serve the community throughout the year, on  the Board of Directors and on committees.

Poinsettia Maintenance Tips    With proper care during the holidays, the life  of a poinsettia can be extended throughout  the year. During the holidays:     When selecting a poinsettia, choose  tightly clustered, small, central flowers  with crisp and bright foliage.   When surface soil is dry to the touch,  water thoroughly. Discard excess water  in the saucer.   To prolong color, keep a temperature  range of 60 degrees for night and 72  degrees for the days. High humidity is  preferred.   Avoid cold drafts and protect from cold  winds.    To rebloom for next season:     During the winter, continue to follow  holiday upkeep tips.   When bracts fade, cut back to eight  inches.   Lightly fertilize every three to four  weeks.   When temperatures are warm, place  plant outside, first in indirect, then direct  sunlight. Avoid temperatures below 50  degrees throughout the summer.   Cut back stems and branches twice  during the summer, and repot if  necessary.   During the first week of September,  move plant inside. Provide six or more  hours of direct light.   From October 1 through mid-December,  confine plant to darkness for 14 hours,  giving it 10 hours of natural light. This  will force the green bracts to change  color.  9 The GRIT - December 2017 - Volume 33 - No. 12 10 The GRIT - December 2017 - Volume 33 - No. 12 11   The GRIT – December 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   Community Event Bulletin Board    None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
