March  2017   Vol. 33 – No. 3  Message from the President, Joe Pappe ~  Many thanks to all of you who came to the Annual Meeting on February 4th.  Now  that the 2017 Annual Meeting is over, we have lost two Board members. Michael  Pierce was a Board member since 2010 and is a longtime volunteer on the  Architectural Control Committee. George Connor was a Board member in 2001- 2003 and again in 2010-2016 and has done a first-rate job as Secretary for the past  5 years. George also served as chair of the Communications & Publications and  Park & Safety Committees. We will miss both of them, and we extend our sincere  thanks for their service to SHHA and to the Sandia Heights community.  Your Association exists to support you, the members, and to uphold the  standards that make Sandia Heights such a unique and beautiful community, but  we need your help! Please consider volunteering for one of our committees or for  the Board. One committee that really needs members is the Covenant Support  Committee (CSC), but we will gladly accept volunteers for any of our committees.  We welcome your letters or emails expressing your concerns. You may e-mail us  at sandiaheights@comcast.net.  Annual Report from the President, Joe Pappe ~     The Board participated in the Mhoon-Hawks Landing successful mediation  resolution.      SHHA hosted two Meet-and-Greets with Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office on  area security, which were coordinated by the Parks & Safety (P&S) Committee.      The Board reviewed association procedures to ensure compliance with the NM  Homeowner Act (HOA) of 2013. The HOA makes certain information available  to members. The accessible information required by the HOA can be found on the  SHHA website or by requesting the required information in writing.      Annual Report from the Vice President, Bob Bower ~  The Vice President served on the Executive Committee and performed the duties  of the President at his request during times of his absence. The Vice President is  also Chairperson of the Nominating Committee. It was announced that three new  Directors were added to the Board in 2016.  SHHA 2017 Annual Meeting was held February 4, 2017  Officer and Committee Annual Reports are  Published in this Month’s GRIT  2   The GRIT – March 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 3                                                                                                    Annual Report from the Secretary,  George Connor ~  During 2016, the Secretary oversaw the production of  all Board Meeting minutes, certified the presence of a  quorum necessary for the proper conduct of business  at each Board Meeting, ensured the preparation and  publication of the notification for the Annual Meeting,  and ensured the preparation and filing of SHHA’s  annual report for non-profit corporations to the State  of New Mexico.  The Secretary is also responsible for  maintaining and updating the Official Records Book  which is on file at the SHHA office and is responsible  for providing Board-approved answers to all questions  and concerns expressed by members attending the  2017 Annual Meeting and Town Hall Meeting held on  February 4, 2017.    The Board is putting together written responses to  questions from the Annual Meeting and Town Hall  Meeting. We anticipate posting the questions with  written answers, by Board members, by the end of  March. If you spoke and asked a question(s) or  expressed concerns about a Sandia Heights  neighborhood issue, please look for your answer(s) on  the website.  In some cases, where the question or  concern is about only one or two items, we may also  be able to send the individual submitting the item a  direct response. In addition, the Annual Meeting  PowerPoint Presentation Slides have been posted to  the website at the following link: https://2017 SHHA  Annual Meeting PowerPoint    Annual Report from the Treasurer, Woody  Farber~  The 2016 final Year-end financials will be posted on  the website under the Board tab after the March Board  meeting.

The 2017 SHHA Budget:  • After reviewing the Finance Committee’s proposed  2017 budget at its November 9, 2016 meeting, the  Board approved the budget.  • The Finance Committee developed the budget based  on the current and projected reserves and the  revenues needed to cover the services needed by the  property owners.  • The Board maintained the SHHA dues at  $8.00/month for 2017.  • The Board approved an increase in Tram passes to  $6.00 each.  • This allows for a reasonable targeted Net Income  for 2017.  Each year the income and expenses  will be reviewed to establish the best course of  action for the following years.  •  Budgets are projections which may change as the  year progresses, so please go to the Finance tab  on the Board section of the SHHA website for  current details.  The budget vs actual will be  posted on the website on a monthly basis  following Board acceptance of the financial  reports.

The President presented the following CS&M report:  • The Tram Pass program continues to offer eight  passes per day for $6.00 per pass.

We will continue to have eight passes  per day in 2017.  •  SHHA Merchant Benefits Program is a program  that allows SHHA members to get a discount from  the participating merchants.

This  film is based on Ted Chiang’s Nebula-Award-winning  novella “Story of Your Life”, and it retains the story’s  extraordinary narrative structure. Beyond changing the  title, the main departures of the film from the novella are  found within the usual Hollywood add-ons, mostly of  the “things that go boom” variety, e.g., combat ships,  fighter aircraft, high explosives, impending world war,  etc. Other than that sop to popular culture, the film  preserves the delicate beauty of the novella remarkably  well.    The story’s motivation lies along a well-worn path in  science fiction, namely the difficulty of effectively  communicating with an alien intelligence. Stanislaw  Lem’s classic “Solaris” erected a complex narrative  edifice around this same topic, but “The Arrival” takes a  totally different path, with the viewer gaining a two-hour  alien language immersion lesson through the eyes and  ears of our protagonist, one Dr. Louise Banks.     Dr. Banks is a linguist, and her experiences upon arrival  of an advanced race of alien beings form the heart of the  film. Louise is played to perfection by Amy Adams, and  thankfully, Ms. Adams is not relegated to her usual  supporting role (e.g., Lois Lane in the recent Superman  series reboot), but instead radiates her star power as Dr.  Banks becomes the singular point of contact between  humanity and a heptagonal race of advanced aliens.  Think “smart inky octopus minus one tentacle” and  you’re getting into the right neighborhood.    But it’s not the alien cephalopod’s anatomical geometry  that powers the film: it’s their language. More  accurately, it’s their two languages, one spoken and one  written. The written version is central to the plot, and  Dr. Banks’ developing understanding of the subtleties of  that language creates the crisis and opportunity that  drive the movie to a unique and cerebral conclusion.     Jeremy Renner is understated for a change, as LANL  physicist Ian Donnelly, and it’s good to see Renner  wearing eyeglasses instead of his Marvel Avenger  archery outfit. Forest Whitaker is, as always, dependable  as Colonel Weber from Army Intelligence, wearing  worry on his uniform’s sleeve as he tries to figure out  what these aliens want from us. But it’s Amy Adams  who carries the film over an entire lifetime of  experience, and it’s that “lifetime” idea that makes the  story such an unusual and enjoyable vehicle for an alien  invasion movie.  4   The GRIT – March 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 3                                                                                                          STATS FROM SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  If you have questions regarding the following stats, please call Sandia Heights Security 856-6347, mobile 263-4654.

Johnny has been an integral part of our company, and  more importantly, our community, for nearly the past 50 years.  His hard  work, dedication and commitment to our Sandia Heights family and  community are but a few of the valued qualities we have come to depend  upon, and will so greatly miss.  We truly wish Johnny all the best as he enters  this new, exciting and well deserved chapter of his life.       At this time, we would also like to welcome Paul Adkins as our new Security  Manager.  Paul's experience includes 11 years serving as Director of Security  for CP Security Corporation in California, 10 years as an Arizona Sheriff  Deputy and 17 years in the US Navy Reserves.  We feel confident Paul's  experience, coupled with his degree in Criminal Justice, will be a valuable  addition to our Security team.          Let’s Work Together To Help Protect Our Community    Please ensure you are always aware of your surroundings and your neighborhood. If you see suspicious  activity, please call the Bernalillo County Sheriff's non emergency number (798-7000) and Sandia  Heights Security (263-4654). * For members of Sandia Heights Security that have alarms, please ensure  your alarm companies have Security listed as a contact: 263-4654.  5 The GRIT - March 2017 Judson McCollum Executive Broker 10 Million Dollar Producer Call or Text: (505) 269-3717 JudsonABQ@aol.com Sharon McCollum Executive Broker 15 Million Dollar Producer Call or Text: (505) 269-6217 SMMinABQ@aol.com Selling Sandia Heights Homes!

An  increasing resistance from homeowners to comply  with their covenants has been seen.  This has resulted  in multiple letters from the CSC to the violators and in  some cases from our attorney.     Of particular note are violations of not filing ACC  requests for work done and light intrusion.  The latter  is an attempt by many violators to thwart theft.  Many  of the light complaints are not from unshielded flood  lights but from other bright fixtures which are  violations of the Bernalillo light ordinance.    Although we have gained three people on the CSC we  have lost an equal number.  Due to the amount of time  each complaint investigation takes and need for more  volunteers, we anticipate longer times to resolve  complaints.    Covenant Support Committee ~ Dick  Wavrik, Chair    Comments made at the 2017 Annual Meeting indicate  that there is some confusion as to what the CSC can  and cannot do.      1. First of all SHHA cannot modify or change your  covenants.  This can only be done by property owners  in your Unit.  The home page of the SHHA website  has the procedures that may be referenced to amend  covenants.  Many of the Units west of Tramway Blvd.  have amended their covenants; however these were  done in the 1990's and the Units have fewer owners  than Units East of Tramway Blvd.    2.  For violations, SHHA cannot recover legal fees or  fine the violator without a court order permitting us to  do so.  This is a long expensive process but we will do  this.  The complainant may be asked to become a co- plaintiff in a lawsuit.    3.  The CSC does not give updates or progress  reports to the complainant; however, when the file is  closed the complainant will be notified.  In some cases  legal resolution may take months or more as we are  bound to the schedules of the court and the legal  process.    4.  CSC has no authority to enforce County  ordinances or laws.  We will refer the complainant to  the appropriate county agency.    5.  Most covenants have "annoyance and nuisance"  wording, however, this becomes very subjective and  difficult to enforce.    6.  Security is handled by the Sheriff's department  and the Sandia Heights Security staff.    7.  Membership in SHHA and the Security Service in  most Units (not all) is voluntary. It would require  covenant amendments to have all owners participate  and share the cost.    There are many constraints as to what the CSC can do.   We are bound by what your covenants permit.       PROCEDURES FOR PROPERTY  OWNERS TO AMEND THEIR   UNIT COVENANTS    The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association  (SHHA) cannot modify or change any unit  covenants.  Any covenant changes or modifications  can only be done by the property owners within their  individual unit. SHHA recognizes the right of  property owners to amend the covenants of their  units in accordance with procedures set forth in the  covenants of each unit. SHHA has developed  information to facilitate that process and to ensure  that a proposed amendment is in agreement with  established covenants. To avoid potential conflicts  with the existing covenants, it is suggested that the  proposed amendment(s) be presented to the SHHA  Board of Directors for review prior to initiating a  petition signature effort.   The information and steps to initiate a covenant  amendment are available on the home page of  the SHHA website or the following link:  https://Procedures for Property Owners to  Amend Unit Covenants.pdf. A copy may also be  obtained from the SHHA office.    THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF  ACTIVE CSC VIOLATIONS:  Unit No.  Type of Suspected  Violation         S5  No Prior ACC Approval  S18, S19  Parking  S18  Yard Maintenance     SHHA Court Action   S5  No Prior ACC Approval    6 Files Closed Since the Last GRIT  8   The GRIT – March 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 3                                                                                                     Annual Report from the Architectural  Control Committee ~ Bob Bower, 2016 Chair    The year 2016 was similar to our activities in 2015.  A  total of 342 applications were approved which is a  slight increase over the 324 applications approved in  2015.  The ACC continued to work with the County  on new developments in the community.  These  include the North Tramway Estates (NTE) and the  Hawks Landing developments.  Many of the 14  building sites in the NTE development have been sold  and the Hawks Landing project is scheduled to begin  construction of its planned development of 33  residences in mid-2017.    Just as a reminder, the ACC is chartered by the  covenants for all SHHA Units.  It manages the  architectural control process for SHHA by approving  all changes to the external appearance of properties  within the community (e.g., new construction,  additions, remodels, walls & fences, landscaping).   There has been a general decline over the past several  years in large construction efforts, particularly with  the construction of new homes on existing vacant lots  within the community.  As such, the ACC has spent  most of its activities on remodeling activities.  Based  on the scope of these efforts, the ACC conducted  several neighborhood reviews in 2016 in its on-going  effort to obtain inputs from neighbors in the  immediate vicinity of the proposed projects prior to  the final approval of these projects.    Again as a reminder, the ACC meets on the first and  third Wednesdays of the month and more frequently if  needed.  Throughout most of 2016 the ACC had eight  active members.  Guidelines (these are on the SHHA  website) are published and periodically updated to  assist residents with design projects.  The ACC also  maintains a Project Log on the website which displays  all current ACC projects.  The monthly GRIT  newsletter also lists the projects approved for the  current month.  Articles are also published in the  GRIT to help educate residents on the ACC processes  such as neighborhood reviews and on a variety of  other topics of interest.  For quick reference, a list of  titles of GRIT articles published in a given year is  summarized in the January edition of the following  year.    In 2017, the ACC will continue to keep the  community informed on the following efforts:  --PNM rate hike decisions  --Changes to the County’s Wastewater Ordinance and  how these changes will affect our residents who own  septic systems  --The Hawks Landing development effort    ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   11 Juniper Hill Road – Window and Deck  Replacement and Reroof   28 Cedar Hill Place – Landscaping and Retaining  Wall  419 Live Oak Court – Roof Repair  502 Black Bear Loop – Install Gutters   623 Cedar Hill Road - Reroof  725-9 Tramway Lane – Refinish House Trim                         810-F Live Oak Road – Reroof  865-3 Tramway Lane Court – Photovoltaic Panels  867-E Tramway Lane Court – Garage Door  Replacement and Down Spouts  948 Deer Drive - Reroof  950 Deer Drive – Install Fence  981 Antelope Avenue – Wall, Fence and  Landscaping  1018 Tramway Lane – Stucco Repair  1431 Honeysuckle Drive - Reroof  1808 Tramway Terrace Loop - Reroof  2019 Quail Run Drive – Garage Door Replacement  2412 Tramway Terrace Court – Plant a Tree  2454 Tramway Terrace Court – Window  Replacement  2508 Tramway Terrace Court – Window and Door  Replacement  2864 Tramway Circle – Install Deck  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.
