By Hugh Prather, Unit 23    Anyone who spends time reading the posts on the social media application,  Nextdoor, will notice a good number of posts devoted to safety and security:  ǲsuspicious vehicle,ǳ ǲstranger at my door,ǳ ǲattempt to break in.ǳ While  there are plenty of other non‐safety‐related posts‐‐missing pets, giveaways,  someone to help out with yardwork‐‐the need to reach out to others for  safety issues is a frequent concern.    Reaching out to others for neighborhood safety is exactly what  Neighborhood Watch provides our community. By organizing a  Neighborhood Watch program, Units provide another important link in  neighbors helping neighbors maintain the safety and security of our  respective Unit Communities within Sandia Heights.    Unit 2͵, the Las Casas neighborhood, had several important precursors in  place before we successfully applied and were approved to become a  Bernalillo County Neighborhood Watch community. Over the last ͳ5 years,  this neighborhood has organized an annual Memorial Day Block Party to  bring neighbors together to get to know each other and to build a stronger  sense of neighborhood identity.

With a  single email address, anyone of the 26 residents in  our neighborhood can now make the other 25  aware of a relevant neighborhood issue, e.g. “saw a  coyote on my back wall this morning while letting  the dogs out…”. The Google Group has given all of  us an opportunity to keep each other informed of  important and safety related issues.    Finally, last year for the first time, we used Survey  Monkey to do a quick assessment of how people  felt about the Las Casas Neighborhood and how we  might improve the quality of life in our  neighborhood. One of the suggestions encouraged  the creation of Neighborhood Watch.    The process of creating a Neighborhood Watch is  fairly simple but primarily depends on one  individual in the neighborhood willing to go point  with the project. The Neighborhood Watch Leader  (Block Captain) is a key for the project to succeed.  Longtime Las Casas resident, Roseann Houlihan,  stepped up in our neighborhood and helped make  the whole thing happen.    Roseann’s first step was to contact Bernalillo  County Neighborhood Coordination Specialist  Darrell Dady (505.468.7364) who is the point  person for Bernalillo County in creating a  Neighborhood Watch area. Darrell sent Roseann all  the necessary material and Roseann went to work.     She went door to door to determine interest and  found there was a significant positive response to  the idea of creating a Neighborhood Watch for our  unit of Sandia Heights. She had well over the  requisite 50% of the neighbors interested in  participating.    She then scheduled a meeting with Darrell and a  representative from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s  Office where the entire program was laid out for all  those in attendance. Residents from over half of the  26 homes in our Las Casas neighborhood were in  attendance. The two‐hour meeting with BCSO  Captain Sharp and Mr. Dady launched our inclusion  as an official Neighborhood Watch neighborhood.  Our street signs warning that you are now entering  a Neighborhood Watch Community have been  installed at the entrance to unit 23.      ATTENTION ALL SANDIA  HEIGHTS RESIDENTS!       Did you know? Regardless of whether you are a  member of Sandia Heights Homeowners’  Association (SHHA), you are legally responsible  for adhering to your covenants and Bernalillo  County Ordinances!     Violations are enforceable. Always check the covenants  you received with your closing documents, or on  SHHA’s website (www.sandiahomeowners.org). Or call  the SHHA Office (797‐7793) for guidance.    LIGHTING:  Exterior lights must be shielded and shine  on your property only, never into your neighbor’s  windows. Bernalillo County also has enforceable  lighting ordinances; call 314‐0350.    CONSTRUCTION: All external home and landscape  changes must be approved in advance by SHHA’s  Architectural Control Committee (ACC). See the website  or Office for guidelines and applications.    NOISE: Sound carries far and can disturb others.     PARKING: RVs, camper trailers, and boats can be  parked for up to 48 hours to load or unload them. Do  not store them on your property or on the street, unless  a method of storage has been approved by the ACC.  Your covenants might require that inoperable vehicles  must be moved after 30days.    LANDSCAPE: Remove all dead or dying trees, shrubs,  and brush. Particularly if you own a patio home, remove  weeds and leaf litter frequently.     BINS: Remove trash and recycling bins as soon as  possible after collection. They must be stored out of  sight. Place them at the curb after 5 pm the day before  collection or before 7 am on collection day. During April  through November, when bears are active, wait until  the day of collection.      3   The GRIT – June 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 6                                                                                                      Movie Reviews   By “The SHHA Couch Potato”    My mom used to describe nutritious food as ǲit will  stick to your ribs.ǳ  And since any self‐respecting  couch potato loves food, I’ve long since applied  mom’s culinary descriptors to characterizing movies.  For example, the classic Wachowski Brothers movie,  ǲThe Matrix,ǳ is a ǲstick to your ribsǳ kind of flick, i.e.,  there’s plenty of food for thought even after repeated  viewings.    On the other hand, some movies are what I call  ǲcotton candy,ǳ because they are delicious upon a  first watching, but don’t have any rib‐sticking, long‐ term nutritional value. They’re fun, but after a turn or  two, it’s time to cut back on the sugar in search of  healthier fare.    The latest Star Wars movie, ǲRogue One,ǳ is a perfect  example of a cotton‐candy movie. It’s great fun to  watch, with a terrific cast and awesome whiz‐bang  technical effects, but anyone familiar with the  original ͳ977 ǲEpisode IV: A New Hopeǳ knows how  ǲRogue Oneǳ is going to end: we all saw that opening  screen crawl of ǲ...Pursued by the Empire’s sinister  agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,  custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people  and restore freedom to the galaxy.ǳ There will be no  surprise endings in this movie!    But cotton candy movies are fun even if we know the  ending, and ǲRogue Oneǳ doesn’t disappoint in the  treacle department. The new characters we are  introduced to include a blind quasi‐Jedi warrior and  his trusty sidekick ȋplayed by Asian superstars  Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang, respectivelyȌ; our plan‐ stealing protagonist, Jyn ȋportrayed with due  pluckiness by Felicity JonesȌ; and Alan Tudyk ȋof ǲI,  Robotǳ and ǲFireflyǳ fameȌ, cast as the latest, and by  far the coolest, android in the Star Wars universe.    Forest Whitaker’s talents are largely wasted as rebel  leader Saw Gerrara ȋhe spends much of his screen  time rearranging his breathing apparatus, to little  dramatic effectȌ. And since Mads Mikkelsen seems to  be appearing in every movie made of late, he shows  up here as Galen Erso, who is the father of both Jyn  and the Death Star. Anybody care to guess who  provided Jyn with those Death Star plans!?    And if the great cast and the awesome special effects  aren’t enough, the film resurrects a couple of now‐ deceased cast members from the original movie!  Villainous Gran Moff Tarkin and heroic Princess Leia  Organa appear in ǲRogue Oneǳ through the magic of  ͵D special effects. It makes one wonder if we need a  new Oscar category for ǲBest Supporting Actor from  Beyond the Grave.ǳ    The story, like all Star Wars storylines, is entirely  predictable: the bad guys can’t shoot straight, while  the good guys possess aim that is true, and  everything comes together at the last moment to land  the Death Star plans in the hands of Princess Leia and  R2D2, with Darth Vader in close pursuit. So sure, it’s  predictable, and the special effects are the real stars  of the show. But like cotton candy, ǲRogue Oneǳ is  way too much fun for as long as it lasts.

Really? Well no, not really, and that's the point of Bernalillo County’s  educational campaign.  Our pets, especially our dogs, make great  companions as we enjoy the wonderful outdoor  spaces of Bernalillo County. But we need to take care  of our beautiful natural environment by picking up  after our pets. Whether you’re enjoying an open  space trail or just your own neighborhood, you can  keep our county more attractive and healthier by  ǲscooping your pet's poop!ǳ   Why should we 'grab it, bag it, toss it'?  When pet waste is not picked up, it does not magically  disappear or fertilize the ground. It remains there  until it gets washed away by stormwater.  Then  stormwater pollution happens because that pet waste that was left on the streets, yards, trails or  roadsides is then picked up by stormwater runoff and carried into drains or arroyos. Stormwater is not  treated before it reaches the river, and pet wastes contribute to poor water quality. To find out more out  go to http://www.bernco.gov/poopfairy.  Dog waste is a serious source of bacteria in the river. About 20 percent of the bacteria in the river comes  from our pet dogs. It doesn’t break down in our dry climate; it just waits for the rain. Please Scoop the  Poop, and learn more about the There is No Poop Fairy campaign.  Due to the success of Bernalillo County’s past yard sign campaign, they are currently unable to provide  free yard signs at this time.

In addition, carbon monoxide ȋCOȌ detectors  should be replaced every five to seven years.    Since most homeowners normally change just the  batteries on their safety devices, SHHA is reminding  you to take look at the real age of your device by  checking the date of manufacture or expiration date  on the back. If there's no date and you can't  remember when you bought it, you're probably due  for a new one.    Various types of safety devices are available to  purchase, either online or at a home improvement  store. For more information on how to test and  install a new smoke alarm, visit:  http://www.nfpa.org/public‐education.

There are many ways to satisfy this need, but doing  an Airbnb or room rental is not one of them. It is  very tempting to rent out the extra bedroom in  order to make extra money; however, your  covenants do not permit this.    There are also concerns about maintaining security  in your neighborhood as a short‐term landlord. You  are inviting transient renters into the area, which  may pose a threat to your neighbors. The Sandia  Heights Security Patrol, available by subscription,  does a great job of patrolling and looking for  unfamiliar cars in your area.  But by doing short‐ term rentals, you make their job more difficult.    If you have your home listed as a daily room rental,  please immediately remove your listing. If your  neighbor is involved in room rental, please file a  covenant complaint so that we may investigate.      Summer is Here    Unfortunately, also returning are boats, campers,  trailers, and RVs. When you bought or rented your  home in Sandia Heights, you agreed to follow your  Unit covenants, which have restrictions on parking  these vehicles on your lot. SHHA does not look for  violations, but rather investigates complaints  submitted by your neighbors whose names are not  divulged.  After investigation, if a violation is  confirmed, you will receive a letter asking you to  correct the problem by a specified deadline.    Note: In previous court action, it has been ruled that  RVs fall under the definition of a house trailer.  Camper trailers, motor homes, and RVs are allowed  on‐site for up to 48 hours to load, unload, or do  maintenance.  8   The GRIT – June 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 6                                                                                                       ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects since the last GRIT:   ͵7 Rock Ridge Drive – Gazebo Installation  48 Rock Ridge Drive – Patio Enclosure  7ͳ Pinon Hill Place –  Restucco  ͳ͸͸ Juniper Hill Road – Garage Addition, Patio  Cover and Remodel/Expansion of Master Bedroom  ͳ85 Big Horn Ridge – Reroof Porch and Install Stair  Railing  224 Spring Creek Lane – Patch and Reseal Asphalt  Driveway  ͵͵4 White Oaks Drive – Window Replacement ͸2͵ Cedar Hill Road – Repair Stucco  7͸0‐ͳ0 Tramway Lane – Resurface Deck and  Repaint House Trim  808 Tramway Lane – Restucco  90ͳ Tramway Lane – Replace Front Porch Beams,  Repaint House Trim and Garage Door  994 Lynx Loop –  Reroof  ͳͳ57 Laurel Loop – Water Feature  ͳ805 Tramway Terrace Loop – Install Security  Bars on Windows  2005 Quail Run Drive – Garage Door Replacement 202ͳ Quail Run Drive – Restucco  240͵ Tramway Terrace Court – Reroof  2885 Tramway Place – Elastomeric Coating of  House and Paint Trim and Garage Door  82ͳ8 Raintree Drive – Garage Door Replacement 8249 Raintree Drive – Reroof  9ͳ00 Lynx Loop – Stucco Repair and Recolor  House  9ͳͳ4 Lynx Loop – Reroof  ͳ270ͳ Colony Place – Reroof    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.      Portable Storage Containers  Over the past several years, SHHA has noted that the  popularity of Portable On Demand Storage ȋPODSȌ  containers, as well as storage containers from other  suppliers, has resulted in an increased presence of  these containers here in Sandia Heights. These  containers are used to provide temporary, on‐ site secure storage for personal items. ȋThey are not  to be confused with the large open‐topped  dumpsters used during construction for temporary  storage and removal of debris.Ȍ In most cases, these  secure storage containers are placed in the front  portion of a property where they are being used,  usually during short‐term home remodeling or  repairs, for temporary storage of such items as  furniture. Along with the increased use of these  secure containers within Sandia Heights comes, as  expected, an increase in complaints from residents  who can see them from their properties. When  applying to the Architectural Control Committee  ȋACCȌ for additions or remodels to the exterior of  your residence, your  application should state  whether or not one or more  of these secure storage  containers will be used in  conjunction with the  construction. The ACC’s intent is not to deny usage  of these containers, but to understand exactly how  long they will be located on the property and to  address any neighborhood complaints. If the ACC  determines that the containers have exceeded the  timelines for expected usage on the property as  stated in the ACC application, the owner will be  contacted to either modify the application or  remove the containers. In the event that one or  more secure storage containers are needed for  interior modifications that are not subject to prior  ACC approval, property owners are asked to notify  the SHHA Office of the presence and anticipated  timeline of the containers.       9 The GRIT - June 2017 10 The GRIT - June 2017 11   The GRIT – June 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 6              Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: sandiahomeowners.org.
