Continued on page 2            NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT: THIRD IN A SERIES  Joe Pappe      As with previous columns where I promised to share with you, our members,  my concerns about our community and its future, here is the third column in  this GRIT series you have seen this year.    The Association will not be able to continue. In past columns, I have asked  again and again for volunteers to step forward to keep the business of the  Association working. As of this writing, not enough volunteers have come  forward to fill the Board of Directors positions that will be vacant in 2018.  According to the By-laws, not having the required minimum number of  Directors means the Board cannot do any Association business, and as a  result the Association must dissolve by the end of the year. The Board of  Directors must make the decision to continue or not in November.      How does dissolving the Association affect you? Current Association  services become unavailable to you. All committees are dissolved. This  means:  No Architectural Control Committee (ACC) support  No Covenant Support Committee (CSC) support  No services such as notary, copying, and fax support and reduced- price Tram passes  Discontinuation of Association publications such as the annual  Resident Guide and Directory and the monthly GRIT newsletter    Without ACC and CSC committees available to do the Association’s work,  no one will be looking out for your property values and protecting your  views. This means no enforcement of architectural control or of adherence to  each unit’s covenants. Any homeowner can do anything he or she wants to do  without having to follow the Association’s architectural control guidelines  and unit covenants. Since the covenants “run with the land and are binding to  all residents”, your only recourse will be to prosecute, at your own expense,  any action in the proper court for covenant violations in your individual unit.  The covenants will still be in effect, but there will be no Association to pursue  covenant violations.

If so,  we need you to volunteer. If you are interested in volunteering, check the website for information regarding  forms for volunteering, and information on committees. Also, please contact the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association Office if you are interested in volunteering. And look for my fourth column on the status of the  Association in the next issue of The GRIT.      2018 SHHA Resident Guide and Directory Deadline    Please check your listing in the 2017 Resident Directory and let the Office know if you have any  changes or additions. All changes must be received on or before Friday, October 27th, 2017, in  order to be included in the 2018 Resident Guide and Directory.      What is a Single Family?  By Dick Wavrik, CSC Chairman    We get complaints from concerned homeowners  regarding a residence apparently being rented to  multiple people in "violation" of a single-family R1  zone and Unit covenants. We have consulted with  Bernalillo County and our attorney and have taken the  following position:    1.  Daily rental, such as a bed and breakfast listing, is  not permitted.  2.  If the entire house is being rented under one lease  to up to 12 individuals who are not related, the lease  may not violate the covenants. The Bernalillo County  Zoning Ordinance defines "family" as "one or more  [unrelated] persons occupying a premise and living as  a single housekeeping unit as distinguished from a  group occupying a boarding house, lodging house or  hotel, not exceeding 12 people."   3.  There are protected groups, such as group homes,  in which the Court has found that the group home  functioned as a single family. The group home was  therefore allowed in the single-family community, as  opposed to a hospice, a boarding house, or a hotel.  4.  The issue of cars parked on the street needs to be  addressed to the Sheriff’s Department, as the streets  are County property and not under covenant  enforcement by SHHA.      DRONES  By the Covenant Support Committee    New technologies are upon us!  As drones have  become cheaper and more available, so have concerns  about invasion of privacy. Several of our neighbors  are concerned  about drones  peering in  their  windows or  flying over  their  backyards.  To date, there has been little restriction on flying  drones in the County (FAA has some restrictions  around airports). NM Senate Bill 556, 2103 session,  addressed drone use for surveillance, and  Albuquerque has restrictions on which parks may be  used for drone flights. There are also concerns if the  drones are used to "spy" on children (the Sheriff's  Department will address this concern). However, there  is nothing that the SHHA can do to address careless or  uncaring drone pilots. You should express your  concern to our County Commissioner and urge the  enactment of ordinances to control drone flight.    If you enjoy flying drones, please do so in a  responsible manner. Go to one of the city’s approved  parks and keep them out of our neighborhood. Try not  to let your hobby destroy the tranquility of Sandia  Heights.    3   The GRIT – October 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 10                                                                                                    ACC Activity Log    Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:     2 Sandia Heights Drive – Roof Repair  16 Juniper Hill Loop – Restucco and Replace Front  Door  53 Rock Ridge Court – Replace Mailbox  77 Pinion Hill Place – Ground Mounted  Photovoltaic Panel Installation  82 Juniper Hill Road – Landscaping (Trees)  176 Big Horn Ridge Drive – Fence and Security  Door Installation  236 Spring Creek Court – Restucco  429 Live Oak Road – Landscaping  529 Roadrunner Lane – Re-grade Driveway  604 Cedar Hill Road – Replace Windows and  Doors  711-37 Tramway Place – Replace Gate, Doors and  Paint House Trim  726-3 Tramway Vista Court – Garage Door  Replacement  727-4 Cedar Hill Lane – Restucco  795-I Tramway Lane – Reroof and Replace  Windows  890 Tramway Lane – Restucco   1003 Tramway Lane – Re-stain Wood  1023 Tramway Lane – Restucco and Parapet Repair  1065 Tramway Lane – Replace Driveway  1156 Laure Loop – Replace Driveway   1417 San Rafael Ave. - Landscaping  1430 Honeysuckle Drive – Window Replacement  1460 Bluebell Drive – Window Installation  1703 Quail Run Court – Reroof   1805 Tramway Terrace Loop – Gate Replacement  1840 Tramway Terrace Loop – Fence and Gate  Replacement and Trash Bin Screening  2020 Quail Run Drive – Reroof  2303 Calle de Rafael – Reroof  2413 Tramway Terrace Court –Reroof  2452 Tramway Terrace Court –Remove Replace  Tree   2535 Tramway Terrace Court – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  7733 Cedar Canyon Road – Recoat Stucco and Re- stain Miscellaneous  8210 Indigo Court – Restucco  8215 Indigo Court – Restucco and Plant a Tree    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org to read about  all projects currently under ACC management.

In those earlier years we had the  occasional deer and bobcat sightings, but the animals  were exhibiting their innate behaviors of foraging  and moving on.  We did not have homeowners  feeding chicken to the bobcats or corn, apples, and  grain to the deer.  We enjoyed seeing the wildlife  as it moved through the different units.  In  essence, we learned to cohabitate.     Today it is a different scenario.  Neighbors are  attempting to make “pets” out of the deer,  bobcats, and bears because seeing them brings  pleasure.  We now have deer and bobcats that  are permanent residents of some of our units  because they are being fed and have no  reason to go elsewhere.  And now, we can  add bears to the list of permanent residents.   I find bear scat in my yard full of corn.   While those of you who feed say that the  corn is intended for the deer or birds, the  bear are feasting away on it as well.  I would like to ask those of you who  feed the deer and bobcats, and as a  result the bear, to look at the bigger  picture.  You have all heard  repeatedly that you are upsetting the  eco system and that it is not healthy  for the animals.  However, do you  realize that your feeding of the  wild animals has created a  nuisance and a very real danger  with the presence of bear for  immediate neighbors around  you?  With resident deer,  neighbors’ yards are being  decimated.  With resident  bobcats, neighbors’ small animals  and children are at greater risk.  And now, with momma  bears and cubs cruising through the neighborhood at  11am, there is risk to anyone who comes between  momma and her babies.  We all must be extra vigilant at  this point.  When I have asked neighbors to cease feeding, I have  been ignored or laughed at, followed by “they are so  cute”. People don’t seem to listen.  Think about the fact  that you are not living in isolation; you are a member of  a community.  As a member of a community  who feeds the wildlife, you are  impacting the quality of life of those  who live around you. Be a good  neighbor and be considerate of  those who live around you.  Please  discontinue harmful and dangerous  feeding and allow the animals to return  to their normal innate behaviors of  roaming and foraging.  I repeatedly read  of many people complaining of irritating  light from a neighbors’ home; this is a  similar type of nuisance.  The animals you  have attracted are negatively impacting the  people around you.    For those of you who do not know, feeding  the wildlife is against the State Wildlife and  Game laws.  If you are reported, a game  warden will issue a warning; if you continue to  feed, you will be issued a citation.  The result is  a court hearing with consequences of a $500 fine  and/or jail time.  I have enclosed the reference  below.               D.  Causing a nuisance  game animal problem:  It  shall be unlawful for any  person, by their action or lack  of action, whether  intentionally or through  negligence, to cause a  nuisance game animal or  depredation problem by baiting, feeding, or otherwise  enticing game animals to an area, and such persons, if  convicted, may be punished under 17-2-10 NMSA  1978.  The department shall not be required to offer or  provide interventions to depredation complaints caused  by landowner, lessee, or employee of either violating  this prohibition.

The C&P Committee, comprised of several  members, has been placed in inactive status under  the aegis of the Executive Committee, until an  SHHA member volunteers to chair it. In the interim,  SHHA officers and our excellent Office staff have  bent every effort to ensure that The GRIT and our  website are kept on track with the most current  information and mailings.    This is an excellent opportunity for someone with  appropriate skills and an average of up to 15 hours  per month to devote. The importance of this function  cannot be overstated. Below are the key skills we’re  seeking, and the responsibilities entailed.    KEY SKILLS:  • Clear, grammatical writing.  • Readable, interesting style.  • Ability to choose appropriate topics of  interest.  • Strong organizational and teamwork skills.  • Adherence to deadlines.  • Accurate proofreading.  • Responsiveness to interests and needs of  SHHA members.  • Ability to contribute to C&P policy review  and revision, as necessary.  • Optional, but a bonus: good understanding of  graphics, for both print and web.    RESPONSIBILITIES:  • As committee chair, active service on  SHHA’s Board of Directors.  • Monthly publication of The GRIT.  • Preparation of annual Resident Guide and  Directory.  • Oversight of SHHA website.  • Management of C&P’s operation and  maintenance of Office’s technology  infrastructure.  • Preparation of other documents, including,  but not limited to, annual updates for  SHHA’s Rules and Regulations for the  Association; utility-bill stuffers; flyers; and e- mail alerts.  • Leadership of quarterly meetings of C&P  Committee members.    If you’ve read this far, perhaps you’re the person  who fits this role. You’ll find that SHHA’s officers,  Board, and Office staff are here to support and  collaborate with you. Please consider contributing  your talents as C&P chair. Contact the Office at 797- 7793, or at either shha@sandiahomeowners.org  or  sandiaheights@comcast.net. Thank you.
