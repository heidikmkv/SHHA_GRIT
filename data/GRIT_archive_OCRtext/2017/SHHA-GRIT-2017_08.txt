      NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT: FIRST IN A SERIES  Joe Pappe    As my term of office as the President of Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association ȋSHHAȌ draws to a close in the next few months, I will  share with our membership my concerns about our community and its  future. My thoughts are based on nearly a decade of volunteer service  to SHHA—as a member of the Board of Directors for 9 years; an  Architectural Control Committee member for ʹ years; Chairman of the  Covenant Support Committee for ʹ years; Vice President for ʹ years;  and President for 4 years. This column is the first in a series you will  see each month in The Grit through the end of the year.    I ask you, our members: Do you know what your Association does for  you? You’re probably familiar with such benefits as our tram ticket  program, corporate discount offers, and notary public services. But  most significant is this: SHHA protects the value of your property!  Through the activities of our chartered committees—particularly the  Architectural Control Committee and the Covenant Support  Committee—we ensure that deed restrictions, guidelines, and  standards of quality are maintained throughout our community. SHHA  also keeps communication flowing to you about issues that affect you.  It is no understatement whatsoever to say that SHHA plays a vital role  in preserving the worth of your most precious investment: your  property.    We are an organization of volunteers. All of SHHA’s Officers, Board of  Directors, and committee members are property owners—just like  you—who have committed to serve Sandia Heights by contributing  their time, ideas, and effort. Think of this voluntary service as an  investment in sustaining our collective investment in one of  Albuquerque’s most sought‐after communities.    According to SHHA’s By‐laws, however, the terms of those who serve  our community are finite. Very soon, the service life of a number of our  Board members will end. Per the By‐laws, in order to function, SHHA  must retain a minimum of ͳͳ Board members. We are now facing the  very real risk of losing more Board members than we are gaining, and  of dropping below the minimum required.

It is distressing  that, out of a community of over ʹ,ʹͲͲ homes,  there has been not one response. We urgently  need you to step up to the plate—as committee  members, committee chairs, and nominees for  the Board. ȋWhile it has been both customary and  desirable to have served on a committee before  being nominated to the Board, SHHA is open to  consideration of Board candidates who have  appropriate experience.Ȍ    So now I must ask you this question: Do you  want the Association to continue? Please think  seriously about your answer and consider  volunteering. And look for my column in the next  issue of The GRIT.        Construction Courtesy and Safety in  Sandia Heights    By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    This is the time of year when much of the heavy  outdoor construction takes place here in Sandia  Heights. Although some of the following points  are stated in the construction approval letter we  send to an ACC applicant, experience has shown  us that a few of these points need additional  emphasis and that other items not included in  the approval letter need to be addressed.    When you have significant construction activities  underway at your property, please consider the  following points as a matter of courtesy to your  neighbors and for the safety of the community:    ͳ. Please limit all noisy work to between ͺ am  and ͸ pm, Monday through Saturday, and try not  to schedule exterior work on Sunday. If your  project involves significant amounts of up‐front  excavation, please consider not performing it on  holidays and weekend days.    ʹ. Control your construction debris by using  appropriate trash containers, so our local winds  don’t scatter it outside the borders of your  property. Make sure that the containers are  periodically emptied and, if possible, not placed  in the street. If your contractor is building your  home or addition using ǲgreenǳ standards, this  code prohibits the use of on‐site trash dumpsters.  Excess construction materials are required to be  placed in piles, instead of in dumpsters, to  facilitate reuse of materials. Contractors should,  however, use appropriate trash containers for  materials not associated with the construction  ȋlunch trash, etc.Ȍ.    ͵. Make sure your contractors provide  receptacles for the safe disposal of smoking  materials such as cigarettes. Spring and summer  can be hot and dry and we don’t need wildfires  caused by the careless discarding of cigarettes at  a construction site. Please pay extra attention to  this point!    4. Don’t allow your contractors to dump used  concrete, stucco ǲswill,ǳ or other construction  materials on empty lots, down street gutters, into  storm drains, or on AMAFCA easements or  County‐controlled  properties such as water  diversion channels. If this happens, you may get  stuck with cleanup costs.    5. Please don’t allow your contractors to create  on‐street traffic problems by parking too many  vehicles on the sides of our narrow roads.    ͸. Ask your contractors to limit the use of radios  and boom boxes that create excessive amplified  music at the construction site.    ͹. Make sure that your contractors maintain  proper sanitary facilities on site for use by  workers at all times.      Remember to stay involved with your  construction project. If you see issues such as  those listed above, take action to correct any  situation that you feel might create a safety issue  for the community or be an annoyance to your  neighbors.    3   The GRIT – August 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 8  Keep Your Trees Healthy!   By Desert Oasis Teaching Garden  Albuquerque has the third‐highest tree mortality  rate in the nation. Numerous factors influence  Albuquerque’s tree mortality, including drought,  lack of adequate irrigation methods, root girdling,  and compact soils. The good news is that we can  change that! Some practical suggestions to keep  your existing trees healthy:  Watering needs to increase and move outward as a tree grows ȋexpanding with the growing root  zone of the treeȌ.  When you first plant a tree, it is good to water just outside the current root zone to encourage the  roots to grow outward.  Watering should cover a wide area around the tree, so lawn sprinklers are good for trees, but they  are not a sufficient source of water. They mimic  rain and can provide good volume and diffuse  distribution to the roots.  If you xeriscape around a tree, it will be important to make sure there are a number of  drips installed all around it.   Deep‐water around the tree ͳ‐ʹ feet into the soil every other week from spring through early fall.   When it is windy, trees will need more water due to the resultant evaporation.  Trees generally do not need fertilizer. Trees do need mulch around them, preferably organic mulch. It provides important soil microbial  activity, increases water‐holding capacity, and  regulates soil temperature.  Place mulch about a foot away from the trunk of the tree outward to the end of the drip zone in a  circle around the tree.  Try not to walk on the soil around a tree when it is wet, so that it does not get compacted.

Roesler, Sandia Heights Resident  Neighbors and friends met at a residence in Sandia  Heights for a Fourth of July neighborhood parade.   The informal parade route circled the two Quail  Run loops and featured a water stop halfway  through.  Safety was reviewed and emphasized  during the parade. The parade was advertised by  word‐of‐mouth for a few weeks ahead of the  event.  Children and adults were encouraged to  decorate themselves and their bikes, strollers, and  wagons for the parade.  Crazy hats, waving flags,  and bouncing balloons were common adornments  on the paraders.   The weather was near ͳͲͲ degrees at the start of  the parade. Children and adults enjoyed cooling off  before and after in a sprinkler set up in a  driveway.  Popsicles, soda, chips, and cookies were  provided pot‐luck style by neighbors. A highlight of  the event was that new and old neighbors met each  other for the first time. Enthusiasm was expressed  by all to make the parade an annual event, with a  goal to advertise it to more residences along the  route.  4   The GRIT – August 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 8                                                                                                         Emergency  Police, Fire, Rescue   911   Sheriff non-emergency  798-7000  Fire non-emergency   798-7000  Poison Control    272-2222    Sandia Heights Security  Mobile       263-4654  Office       856-6347    Sandia Heights Services  Refuse, Water, Sewer  856-6419  After hours emergency  888-5336        SANDIA HEIGHTS SERVICES (SHS) 10 Tramway Loop    Please be reminded that Sandia Heights Services (they provide water, sewer, trash and  recycle collection, and security services) is a subscription service separate   from Sandia Heights Homeowners Association membership.

For the past year we have been asking for help on  the Covenant Support Committee.  We were able to  get one excellent volunteer, but we need more.   When we get a complaint it is assigned to a  volunteer investigator.  If it is a valid complaint, it  will take several site visits to see if the violation is  resolved.  Each trip must be documented in an  investigative report.  The SHHA staff drafts and  sends the appropriate letters as well as keeping  track of the timing for follow‐up site visits.  So if you  feel that maintaining your covenants is important to  preserve the integrity of your neighborhood please   join us on the CSC.  If we don't get enough interest   and support from our members eventually we will  have to consider whether we can continue to do  covenant enforcement. [If you always wanted to  park your RV or boat on your front lawn, paint your  house bright red, have flock of plastic pink flamingos  lining your driveway, and leaving your trash cans  out then no enforcement may be attractive to you].        Room Rental    Big house, feeling lonely, want to meet new folks?   There are many ways to satisfy this need, but doing  an Airbnb or room rental is not one of them. It is  very tempting to rent out the extra bedroom in  order to make extra money; however, your  covenants do not permit this.    There are also concerns about maintaining security  in your neighborhood as a short‐term landlord. You  are inviting transient renters into the area, which  may pose a threat to your neighbors. The Sandia   Heights Security Patrol, available by subscription,  does a great job of patrolling and looking for  unfamiliar cars in your area.  But by doing short‐ term rentals, you make their job more difficult.    If you have your home listed as a daily room rental,  please immediately remove your listing. If your  neighbor is involved in room rental, please file a  covenant complaint so that we may investigate.          SEND IN YOUR PHOTOS NOW!
