If you want to melt the ice and snow, you  may be tempted to use old-fashioned inexpensive rock  salt, but it can be lethal to pets and wild animals if  ingested. In addition, it is only effective at  temperatures around 20° and higher.  Calcium chloride or magnesium chloride are more  effective at lower temperatures. Magnesium chloride  is preferred, as it is safer around animals in addition to  being environmentally friendly. Sand or kitty litter are  two other options to consider. Whichever you choose,  be sure to remove as much snow and ice as possible  first, follow the instructions, spread your granules  evenly, and store the product in a place where children  or animals cannot access it.  Additional hints:   Store in an airtight container or heavy duty  trash can.   Remember that most ice melt products also  damage plants, driveways, and concrete.   Do not spread with bare hands! Apply with  broom, spreader, or a cup.      Odds & Ends from Parks &  Safety Committee  With thanks to Larry & Frances Desonier    As everyone who has lived in Sandia Heights for a  while knows, we can get some pretty bad weather in  winter, particularly in December, that leaves our roads  treacherous For those who may be new to the  neighborhood this is a reminder that our roads are  OWNED and MAINTAINED by Bernalillo County.  Your homeowners association has absolutely NO  authority to do anything about the roads when they are  totally iced over.  The county policy for bad weather is: “The most  heavily traveled roads are prioritized first. As an  example in the Sandia Heights area, Eubank and Paseo  Del Norte would be a priority because of the number  of cars that use it.” In talking to them there       really is no time schedule and they usually work the  storm as it develops. This being the policy, the best   advice is to stay home the morning after a storm, if at  all possible, safe and warm, until the ice on the streets  begin to melt and it is safe to travel.    Pedestrian Safety Reminders  • Walk on the left side of the road Facing Traffic;  make eye contact with drivers approaching you.  • Wear reflective vest or brightly-colored clothing,  particularly in the evening.  • If you are walking a dog, keep the dog to your left.  • Whenever cars approach, a group of pedestrians  should walk in single file.          Movie Reviews by   “The SHHA Couch Potato”    This month, we kick off a new feature for folks who  prefer to enjoy their movies at home instead of at the  local multiplex. For our first article, we’ll look at three  newly released action films that tap timely themes  while offering plenty of antihero action. Of these  films, one is merely good, one is better, and one is  truly best.    Good: “The Take,” directed by James Watkins, stars  Idris Elba as a CIA operative saving Paris from  terrorists who are not what they seem. There is a fine  movie buried in here someplace, but there are also  enough plot holes to make a couch potato head for the  kitchen instead of watching bullets flying and bodies  dropping. Richard Madden gives a strong performance  as a pickpocket with a heart of gold, Charlotte Le Bon  is believable as a bomb mule with a heart of gold, and  Idris Elba is terrific as a rogue CIA agent with (what  else?) a heart of gold. Terrorism in Paris provides a  timely backdrop for the action, and Watkins even  throws in some fake news as a contemporary plot  device. But despite its many features, this movie is  mostly cotton candy, i.e., it’s tasty enough to satisfy as  a buddy movie, but with no real lasting nutritional  value.    Better: The fourth installment of the Bourne Trilogy,  the eponymous “Jason Bourne.” Director Paul  Greengrass and superstar Matt Damon resurrect the  series they both swore they would never revisit, and  we are well-served by their decisions to return.     Continued on page 3  3   The GRIT - January 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 1                                                                                                        Continued from page 2    Jason Bourne is back, this time with his memories  restored and loaded for bear, so the plot has plenty  of non-stop mayhem. Tommy Lee Jones provides  some old new blood as a CIA chieftain, and Alicia  Vikander offers a welcome dose of young new blood  as an enigmatic intelligence agent with a hidden  agenda or two. Julia Stiles reprises her supporting  role as Nicky Parsons, and there are plenty of ties to  newsy topics du jour, including mass  demonstrations, terrorism, and political intrigue.    Best: David Mackenzie’s “Hell or High Water.”  Here, the action is lifted straight out of the classic  western bank-robbers-on-horseback genre, but with  our antiheroes riding in stolen cars instead of on  hooves. Chris Pine gives a star turn as one of two  brothers trying to save the family ranch, and Ben  Foster is terrific as his ne’er-do-well sibling. Jeff  Bridges livens up the action as a grizzled Texas  Ranger, and his law-enforcement partner is played to  pitch-perfection by Gil Birmingham. The storyline is  right out of today’s financial-page headlines, and the  cast of characters is populated with bad-guy bankers,  gun-toting depositors, and sub-prime financial  worries that drive the compelling plot. It’s one of the  best movies of 2016, and it’s the top choice this  month for a discerning couch potato’s quality time in  front of the tube.                            Martin Luther King Jr. Day January 16          Coyotes  By Anne Manning    When we moved our family to Sandia Heights back  in the early nineties we were excited to find coyotes  amongst our neighbors.  At night we would hear  them yipping and howling as they ran through the  arroyo near our house.  We knew that there were  enough rabbits to feed, not only the coyotes, but also  our hunting cat.  She used to leave parts of the  rabbits she caught on the kitchen steps in the garage.   I was also fortunate enough to see the same coyote  just about every day as I walked early in the  morning.  He would appear on the west side of  Tramway, which at that time had not been built over,  and cross the highway near where I was walking.  As time went by, the rabbit population diminished  and the coyotes gradually disappeared – at least in  my neighborhood.  Back in July 2016 I ran across a  fascinating book: “Coyote America – a Natural and  Supernatural History” by Dan Flores who describes  the life and mystical significance of the coyote in  North America.  It is an amazing book that I would  recommend to anyone interested in these magical  animals.  One day, recently, as I was returning from my  morning walk up Live Oak on the west side of  Tramway, I saw a coyote, my first in years, waiting  beside the road at the intersection.  There was quite a  lot of traffic and I was concerned that he would just  run across and get hit.  But the light changed, the  traffic stopped and the coyote, who was aware of my  presence, crossed the road.  When he got to the east  side of Tramway, he walked up a little slope towards  the park, stopped, turned his head and looked  straight at me with an expression that clearly said,  “I’m good, you didn’t need to worry.”  Then he  headed up Live Oak!  Wow, what a gift!      4   The GRIT – January 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 1                                                                                                            STATS FROM SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL  If you have questions regarding the following stats, please call Sandia Heights Security 856-6347,   mobile 263-4654.

Residents are advised not leave mail in mailboxes,  either incoming or outgoing. If you cannot retrieve your mail promptly ask a trusted neighbor to get it for you. If  you are leaving town suspend your mail delivery - have it held at the Post Office.  If you have mail that would be considered sensitive, you may want to mail it at a USPS office. Another suggestion  might be to replace your mailbox with either a heavy duty locking type or totally enclosing the box  with acceptable construction and a lock to impede vandals as well as thieves.  Please be alert to anyone in a vehicle checking mailboxes. A license number on a vehicle along with a vehicle  description would go a long way to putting an end to this activity.  If you experience mail theft, notify the BernCo.  Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) (798-7000), the USPS inspector (1-877-876-2455), and Sandia Heights Security (856- 6347 and 263-4654). If you witness a crime in progress notify BCSO and Security.        2017 Directory Photo Winner  Thank you everyone who submitted a  photo for the 2017 Directory, The photo  chosen for the cover to the left was  submitted by Raymond Brandwein.

If you are  a member of the Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA) and a homeowner  please consider volunteering for your Covenant  Support Committee and help ensure the  enforcement of SHHA covenants. We meet at the  SHHA office once a month and we have the  excellent back up of our SHHA staff.     Covenant enforcement contributes significantly to  maintaining our property values and to preserving  our unique community. If you would enjoy  meeting with interesting, concerned, and fun  neighbors who share your appreciation of Sandia  Heights please consider joining the CSC.  You can volunteer by calling the SHHA office at   505-797-7793.          THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF  ACTIVE CSC VIOLATIONS:  Unit No.  Type of Violation     S2  No Prior ACC Approval  S7  Yard Maintenance  S19  Renting Rooms     SHHA Court Action   S5, S6, S7  No Prior ACC Approval    4 Files Closed Since the Last GRIT          LIGHT REMINDER    We are receiving an increase in lighting  complaints and suspect this is due to security  concerns from our residents.  Unfortunately, we  all moved into a neighborhood with no street  lights, restrictive covenants, and within the  Bernalillo Light Pollution Ordinance.  The  covenants and Ordinance restrict your outside  lights from intruding on your neighbors' property.   There is no waiver for all-night security lighting.      Part of the charm of Sandia Heights is the ability  to enjoy the night sky.  It is suggested that you  look at alternative means for security protection  other than with lights.  If you have guests over  please remember to turn the outside lights off as  soon as possible.  Lights should remain off after  11:00pm and must be aimed to prohibit the light  from leaving your property.  When the covenants  were initially written in the 70’s, there weren’t any  high intensity LEDs or Quartz lights; however, the  CSC will consider these newer technologies as  "flood lights" in our enforcement of lighting  complaints.  A little light goes a long way in our  neighborhood.    TRASH CANS    Trash containers, visible from the street, are also a  major source of complaints.  The trash bins should  be wheeled behind a fence or screen or put in the  garage.  The containers may be put out on the day  before collection in the late afternoon but must be  stored after the trash is picked up.  At this time of  year we also generate more paper and boxes then  will fit into our recycle bins.  If this is your case  then consider using some of the off site recycle  bins throughout the city (found on the BERNCO  web site) or divide the load up for two pickup  cycles.  You can also call Sandia Heights Services  and ask what other options, such as special  pickups, can be arranged.    PARKING    Most all of the covenants address cars that have  not moved from a lot or driveway or are  unlicensed.  These may be a covenant violation for  which the CSC will investigate.  However, we do  get complaints about cars parked on the street or  in communal parking areas.  The CSC does not  handle these parking issues and they should be  referred to the Sheriff's Department.  SHHA does  not have the authority to enforce parking on  county roads or common areas.  The Sheriff can  and will tow cars at the owners expense.  Once  towed it may be difficult or expensive to reclaim  your car, so be mindful of where you park.      8   The GRIT – January 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 1                                                                                                     ACC Activity Log     Summary of Approved Projects activity since the  last GRIT:   7 Juniper Hill Loop – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  37 Rock Ridge Drive – Reroof, Restucco and Paint  95 Juniper Hill Road – Privacy Wall  181 Juniper Hill Road - Reroof  212 Spring Creek Place - Landscaping  319 Big Horn Ridge – Temporary Garden Storage  380 Big Horn Ridge Place – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  538 Black Bear Road - Reroof  749 Tramway Lane – Window Replacement  869-F Tramway Lane Court - Reroof  922 Tramway Lane – Reroof  1012 Tramway Lane – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  1228 Rockrose Road - Landscaping  1478 Morning Glory Road – Window Replacement  1483 Morning Glory Road – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation  1701 Quail Run Court – Deck Replacement  1847 Tramway Terrace Loop – Photovoltaic Panel  Installation, Extend and Raise Wall  1854 Tramway Terrace Loop – Window  Replacement  2726 Tramway Circle – Reroof and Restucco  2732 Tramway Circle – Window Replacement  2878 Brushwood Street – HVAC Installation  2885 Tramway Place – Window Replacement  8213 Indigo Court – Driveway Replacement  Chamisa Park HOA, 720-30 Tramway Lane –  Storage Facility    Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org   to  read about all projects currently under ACC  management.

All couples and  singles are welcome.  The emphasis is on food and fun rather than formal elegance.
