Without new volunteers to replace the Board members  we are losing this year, the Association will not be able  to operate according to the By-laws. This means the  Association will cease to provide the services  Association members have come to expect from the  Board and committee members.  The work of the  Association is intimately tied to your property values,  and the dissolution of the Association will almost  certainly have a dramatically negative impact on those  property values throughout our community. Are you  willing to put the value of your property at risk? Think  about this and ask yourself if you are willing to commit  some of your time to help sustain your Association. And  look for my third column in the next issue of the GRIT.         NEW COLOR REFERENCE  TO BETTER MEET YOUR NEEDS!    Emily Rudin  Member, Architectural Control Committee    Sandia Heights homeowners, you spoke…we listened!    Say goodbye to the old stucco samples and paint charts  you’ve consulted in the SHHA Office over the years  when applying to the Architectural Control Committee  (ACC) for your projects.    The ACC is pleased to offer you a dynamic new  master color guide. We hope you’ll find it useful— even inspiring!— whether you’re proposing to  maintain, construct, or upgrade your house façades,  perimeter and courtyard walls, accents, and trim.  These example colors are intended to represent a range  of options acceptable to the ACC.    Gone are the corporate color names and materials  samples to look at in the Office. No longer might you  spend time trying to locate and purchase a specific  company’s color you saw and liked. Over time, some  of you have told us you’d selected El Rey’s Color X,  or Valspar’s Color Y, which you’d seen displayed in  the Office—only to learn that it was no longer readily  available or even in production.    Designed as a color wheel, our new master chart will  guide your choices as you apply to the ACC. It is  available in two formats when you visit the SHHA  Office. You’ll see a large poster on permanent display  on the wall. For your convenience, you can also  borrow—as with a library book—a portable, high- quality version of the chart from the Office for one  month. A refundable deposit of $20 is required (by  cash or check payable to Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association or SHHA).    We think you’ll find that the chart is easy to use as a  guide, and expands the color possibilities for you to  consider. Please be aware that (a) it does not apply to  roofs, and (b) white is not acceptable. The chart’s  design and colors, which were created by the ACC,  are copyrighted and thus may be reproduced only by  SHHA. The chart will be available in hard copy from  the SHHA Office and not on our website.        Policies for Member Feedback  SHHA welcomes input and articles from SHHA  members and local officials, as well as nonprofit  organizations and individuals with information  appropriate to our area. Deadlines for article  submissions are the 10th of each month.

Content that requires significant editing  will be returned to the person submitting the content  along with the comments of the GRIT staff. GRIT  staff will not rewrite submitted content.   SHHA will not publish anything that is defamatory,  insulting, or demeaning to any person, group, or  organization. Content that is not suitable for  publication will be returned to the person submitting  the content along with the reasons why the content is  not suitable.   SHHA publications will present all sides of any issue  in which there are opposing perspectives.   SHHA publications will maintain a neutral tone for  any issue involving a conflict between the SHHA and  a resident.  3   The GRIT – September 2017 – Volume 33 ACC Activity Log:  Summary of Approved Projects activity since the last GRIT:   47 Pinon Hill Place – Ground-Mounted Photovoltaic Panel Installation   148 Whitetail Road – Landscaping  361 Big Horn Ridge Dr – Install New Security Door 421 Live Oak Ct. – Landscaping and New Wood Shade Structure  632 Cougar Loop NE – Landscaping and Retaining Wall  662 Roadrunner Lane – Replace Evaporative Cooler 711-37 Tramway Place – Install New House Numbers 1064 Red Oaks Loop –Landscaping  1177 Laurel Place – Deck Replacement  1212 Marigold Drive – Install Wooden Fence 1430 Honeysuckle Road – Garage Door Repair 1477 Morning Glory Road – Reroof  1559 Eagle Ridge Road – Fence Replacement 1701 Quail Run Court – Window Replacement 1866 Tramway Terrace Loop – Replace Exposed  Beams  1908 Quail Run Drive – Install Handrail and Replace Beams  1920 Quail Run Dr NE – Window Replacement,  Siding, Driveway Replacement  8214 Indigo Court – Restucco  Visit the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org about all projects currently under ACC management. 33 – No. 9 activity since the last  Mounted Photovoltaic  Install New Security Door  Landscaping and New Wood Shade  Landscaping and Retaining  Replace Evaporative Cooler  Install New House Numbers  Install Wooden Fence  Garage Door Repair  Fence Replacement  Window Replacement  Replace Exposed  Install Handrail and Replace  Window Replacement,  www.sandiahomeowners.org  to read  about all projects currently under ACC management.

What is the job of the SHHA?      A.  The SHHA is a volunteer homeowners  association given the task to enforce covenants by the Tram  Company. SHHA Board members are dedicated to  maintaining our unique community and environment to  ensure continued viability and high property  values. Membership in the Association is largely voluntary,  but our strength lies in everyone's participation who shares  this vision. SHHA is NOT a property management company.     Q.  What is the function of the CSC?    A.  The CSC enforces each of the 35 units’ covenants  as they are written. Most of these covenants are over 35 years  old, but only homeowners, not SHHA, can update them.    Q. Where can I get a copy of my covenants?    A.  Your covenants are on the SHHA website, or you  can come to the SHHA office for a copy. There are no overall  Sandia Heights covenants, only the individual 35 unit  covenants.    Q.  How come I see violations all over Sandia Heights?    A.  Because no one in the unit where the violation  occurs has filed a complaint.       Q.  Why doesn't the CSC look for violations?    A.  By replying on formal complaints from  homeowners in a unit, the CSC is not "selectively enforcing"  covenants. We do not have enough volunteers to patrol all 35  units, with over 2,200 homes, looking for violations. To  assure fair, consistent, and uniform enforcement, we rely on  written complaints from members.    Q.  Can I complain about violations in other units?    A.  Not unless you are directly affected by the  violation, are in an adjacent unit, or in the line of sight.  Covenants limit complaints to those unit homeowners who  have legal standing.    Q.  What is the process for filing a complaint?    A.  Obtain a complaint form from the SHHA website  or from the Office. Cite the specific covenant(s) that you  believe are being violated. Return your signed copy to the  Office (you can e-mail the form with your electronic  signature).    Q. Then what happens?    A.  All complaints are assigned to a CSC investigator  who verifies that a violation exists, usually by a site visit. A  recommendation is made to write a letter from SHHA to the  violator with a deadline to correct the violation. Follow-up  site visits are made to assure compliance. If necessary, SHHA  sends a second letter, followed by two letters from the SHHA  attorney. If there is still no compliance, SHHA’s Executive  Committee and Board of Directors are asked to approve court  action.    Q.  Why do I have to sign a complaint form?    A.  Because it is your complaint. We do not divulge  the name of the complainant unless court action is required.  The complaint form then becomes part of the documentation  submitted to the court and available to the violator and their  attorney.    Q.  Why does it take so long to resolve complaints?    A.  The system works best if violators comply with  their covenants. In some cases, however, the process requires  time for multiple letters, site visits, and, if required, court  action.    Q.  Can we change our covenants?    A.  Yes. All of the 35 sets of covenants allow the unit  homeowners to vote (usually by 75% of owners) to amend  their covenants. SHHA cannot do this for you, as the  covenant is a legal document between you (the homeowner)  and the Tram Company.      Q.  Why doesn't the CSC act on complaints about dog  barking, loud traffic, parking, noise, and general outside  lighting?    A.  These are violations of Bernalillo County codes  and ordinances. SHHA has no legal authority to enforce these  codes and ordinances, and therefore we refer the complainant  to the Sheriff's Dept. or County contact.    Q.  There are lots of bright lights in Sandia Heights. Why  doesn't SHHA do something about it?    A.  Almost all of the covenants address only  unshielded floodlights shining into your property. All other  bright lights are violations of the Bernalillo County Light  Ordinance and enforced by the County.     Q.  Why are many landscaping and home improvements done  without ACC approval?    A.  All covenants require the submission of an ACC  request to do work, and prior ACC approval. This is a  covenant requirement for all residents, whether or not they  are SHHA members. As with all complaints, we rely on unit  homeowners to file a complaint whenever they see work  being done without prior ACC approval and/or that might  violate their covenants.    Q.  Why doesn't SHHA maintain the landscaping in common  areas of many of the units?    A.  SHHA does not own any property in Sandia  Heights. Units with common areas were initially set up by the  unit's developer with maintenance as the responsibility of  homeowners in that unit. SHHA cannot assume the costs and  the responsibility for this maintenance.

How can I help?    A.  Building a strong SHHA with a diverse  membership on committees and the Board of  Directors will assure that your HOA is able to keep up  the property values and lifestyle. You must  participate!    THE CSC THANKS YOU    Since the July GRIT, the CSC has been able to gain  several new volunteers. Thanks for helping make  Sandia Heights a nice place to live by covenant  enforcement.    Note: We have over 2,200 homes in Sandia Heights,  with about 3,300 homeowners who could be  volunteers on committees or the Board of Directors.  Our participation is only about 30 folks-- not a good  percentage! Like any volunteer organization, we  depend on members helping. Imagine Sandia Heights  without a homeowners association. Your very low  ($8.00/month) HOA dues help protect your  investment in your home and tranquility of your life.            Choosing Your Contractor  By Bob Bower, ACC Chairman    Once again, it’s time for my periodic article on  choosing a contractor for your home  improvement projects. Credit for this article goes  to Jessica Speck of JADE Enterprises, Inc., a  local contractor with many years of experience in  the design and construction business here in  Albuquerque. It is well worth reading. Know who  you are dealing with when hiring a contractor— the wrong one can cost you lots of headaches and  money.    Many homeowners are choosing to remodel their  current homes rather than purchase a new one.  But in order to cut costs, some homeowners are  hiring unlicensed and uninsured contractors.  These contractors can become a sizeable liability  to the homeowner through shoddy workmanship  or even by failing to complete the remodeling.  Keep in mind that contracting without a license is  illegal in New Mexico, and hiring unlicensed and  uninsured contractors has had a strong negative  impact on the local home remodeling industry.    There has been a recent rise of unlicensed  individuals entering the home remodeling market  equipped with a set of tools, a truck, and minimal  remodeling skills. They deliver bids to the  homeowner at prices too good to be true!  Unfortunately, many of these individuals end up  getting hired for the remodeling job. Remember  the old adage: “You get what you pay for”; this is  very true for the home remodeling industry. The  use of low-quality materials and shoddy  workmanship can go unnoticed for months or  years. The cost of redoing poor work can be  avoided by using some “up-front smarts” when  choosing the contractor in the first place.    The lack of proper insurance is one of the most  obvious and devastating ways construction costs  are cut. If a contractor should fall off the  homeowner’s roof, use faulty materials and  methods, or damage the homeowner’s home or  belongings, there is no coverage to protect the  homeowner. In these circumstances, the  uninsured contractor cannot afford to pay for  personal injuries and other damages, leaving the  homeowner with an uncompleted project and  significant costs to settle claims against the  homeowner’s insurance policies.    If you have been the victim of unlicensed  contracting or would like more information on the  topic, you can visit the New Mexico Regulation  and Licensing Department’s Construction  Industries Division website at:  www.rld.state.nm.us/CID/unlicensed.htm.     Note:  When hiring a contractor, look for license  number, liability coverage, and workers’  compensation. Don’t be afraid to ask for copies of  these documents to make sure they are up to date.  Good luck with your home improvement projects.  Remember to provide comments (pro and con) to  the SHHA Office for inclusion in our contractor  evaluation books, so other members can take  advantage of your experiences with your  contractors.  9 The GRIT - September 2017 - Volume 33 - No. 9 10 The GRIT - September 2017 - Volume 33 - No. 9 Notice: Any corrections to the printed version of the GRIT can be found on the website: www.sandiahomeowners.org.  11   The GRIT – September 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 9              Community Event Bulletin Board  None of these groups are sponsored by SHHA.
