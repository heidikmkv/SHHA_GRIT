A Note from the Vice President~ Emily Rudin      We sincerely appreciate the interest and participation of all  of the SHHA’s members who attended the Annual Meeting  February 4th.   It’s important to know that your SHHA Officers, Board, and  Office staff are actively committed to the well‐being of our  community all year round.

As SHHA members, you are welcome to share questions and  concerns with us at any time, not only at our Annual Meeting each  February. In addition, please feel free to let the Office know if you  wish to attend a Board meeting, held at 7 pm on the second  Wednesday of each month (except February). Or ask us about  joining one of our committees; it’s an excellent way to get to  know your neighbors, learn about issues we care about, and  contribute to the quality of life we all enjoy here in Sandia  Heights.   An aware and engaged membership benefits us all. We look  forward to seeing you throughout 2017.

Since we are having an exceptionally early spring  it is a great temptation to start pruning – DON'T.   Roses in particular need to wait until April 15 –  remember that date!  I learned that from the Rose  Society annual lectures at Tony Hillerman  Library.  Watch for the announcements, since  they have several pruning sessions.  Roses thrive  in our high desert climate, especially when  pruned and fertilized and watered correctly.    Most trees and shrubs tolerate selective  pruning at any time, except pinions which might  bleed to death when you attack them as the juices  flow (do it in late fall).  Another great temptation is buying your  annual and perennial flowers and vegetables as  soon as they hit the local nurseries or big box  stores.  Unless you have a greenhouse you are  headed for disappointment.  Remember, most of  those plants come from California.  Our climate is  subject to frost until sometime after Easter.  If  you buy plants, keep them in a sheltered area or  inside the house until all frost has past.  It has  snowed on Easter in Sandia Heights.  If you are looking for new plants, choose  only the drought hardy variety.  There are lots of  flowering wildflowers that survive our intense  heat, dry climate and sun:    gaillardia, blanket flowers, lavender, cone flower,  evening primrose, four o'clock, desert marigold  and globemallow.    Some of my wisdom comes from Judith Phillips  book Southwestern Landscaping with Native  Plants which is a wonderful resource for old  timers and newcomers alike.  It also has valuable  advice  on  landscaping  (remember  your  neighbors like their views as well).  Another  resource  is  Growing  Desert  Plants  from  Windowsill to Garden by Theodore B. Hodoba.    Stay tuned for follow up articles for  summer, fall and winter gardening.  If you have  input, that would be welcome as well: just email,  visit, or call the SHHA office.    Just Not Enough Time  by Jo Ann Hamlin, SHHA Member  The highlight of the day for my two  Dachshunds and me is our daily walk. On this day  while they are busy sniffing on leaves, plants,  rocks and the dirt, I look up at the Sandia  mountain, the foothills that I have been  privileged to live in for over forty years and the  incredible city of Albuquerque. The air is filled  with snowflakes drifting slowly down to earth.   I was bundled up in my warm coat and my  new walking shoes that my daughter had given  me for Christmas. The bright colored stripes on  them are what I love the most. They are beautiful.  I looked up and let the snowflakes fall on  my face leaving a wet trail behind them. Aaaah--- the joy of living in Sandia Heights.  And then, it happened. Something under  my feet felt funny. Instead of the hard pavement,  my new shoes were sinking into something soft. I  didn’t wonder what it was, I knew----dog poop. I  looked down---down at the soft, brown pile  oozing over the side of my new shoes.  I don’t swear very much, but I used every  swear word stored in the swear word  compartment of my brain. I tried to think of  reasons why a dog owner would fail to pick up  his/her dog’s poop.   Continued on page 3  3   The GRIT – April 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 4                                                                                                    Continued from page 2    Didn’t have time---I understand how our  days can be so full of things to do that we can’t  cram anything else in. But, I decided to see just  how long it takes to pick up a pile of dog poop. I  looked at the second hand on my watch, took a roll  of poop bags out of my pocket and tore one off. I  looked at my watch again--- four seconds. I opened  the bag---well, I tried to open the bag. I just can’t  believe they can put a man on the moon but they  can’t make a plastic bag that is easy to open. I was  lucky this time; I opened it in twenty seconds. I  picked up the offending pile and tied the top of the  bag, ten seconds. I had a total of thirty four seconds  involved in this task. Throwing the bag in the trash  after I got home was another two seconds. So a  total of thirty six seconds, less than a minute, that  would have left our roadside pristine and beautiful  and our fellow walkers serene and happy to enjoy  a walk that many people feel is a true privilege.  There was one more reason I could think of  that people might not pick up after their dogs. They  just didn’t care. But, I can’t imagine we have  anyone who thinks like that living in Sandia  Heights.     Pack Rats: Our Sandia Heights  Residents [Part 1]  Pack Rats share our property and arroyos, which  may not be beneficial to us. Below is more  information about your mammalian neighbors:    Properly called the White-throated Wood Rat, these  animals are common in New Mexico, and are  nocturnal in nature. They are up to fifteen inches  long and weigh up to ½ pound. Their coloration is a  dark gray-brown on top  with a lighter  underbelly.   Adult pack rats are  solitary: only one adult  per nest. They are  active diggers and  skilled climbers. Their  primary foods are  cactus, but they will eat  almost anything and do  not need a water   source.    Females give birth to two to three young  every six to eight weeks with a life expectancy of  two years.   Since they must have shelter, nests are built  in any protected area including: cacti, bushes,  trees, rock crevices, pool heaters, spas, car engines,  ceiling voids,  gas grills,  under sheds,  and wood  piles. They will  fortify the nest  with  additional  material  including  cactus, rocks,  sticks, dog droppings and just about anything else  they can find; the presence of additional  fortification material is the telltale sign that  distinguishes a pack rat nest from that of a squirrel  or other rodent.    The problems created by pack rats are that  the nests harbor blood sucking kissing bugs  (conenose bugs), fleas, lice, brown spiders,  scorpions, and mice. The nests attract snakes,  skunks, foxes, coyotes and bobcats. The nests  damage and destroy landscaping. Nesting areas  include cars, pool equipment and even get in to the  ceiling voids of homes. They enjoy chewing on and  through wires in cars, attics, spas and pool heaters,  causing fecal and urine material to accumulate.    Lastly, nests are vectors for disease including:  •  Allergic reactions from kissing bugs  •  Hantavirus from mice  •  Plague from fleas  •  Infections from Brown Spider bites.    The Solution will be covered in Pack Rats:  Part 2!

The inmates were asked to respond anonymously to 17  questions detailing how they broke in, when the crime occurred and what they were looking for.   What they learned could help you keep your home safe from burglaries. You can find the  complete list of questions at the following link: http://www.kgw.com/news/investigations/we- asked-86-burglars-how-they-broke-into-homes/344213396 or pick up a copy at the SHHA office.  Although this survey was performed in another state, CRIME HAS NO BOUNDRIES. The survey is  informative and provides insight into how burglars think and how you can better protect your  home.  Burglars stated that they prefer breaking in early morning or afternoon, between 12:30 pm  and 2:30 pm. Most inmates broke in through an unlocked door or window.  Several burglars kicked  the door open but most would leave if an alarm system was in place. Burglars suggested  homeowners should always leave a TV or radio on and most avoided homes with alarm systems.    Get to know your neighbors and call Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office at 798-7000 if you see  anything suspicious.    5 The GRIT - April 2017 6 The GRIT - April 2017 7   The GRIT – April 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 4                                                                                                     Covenant Support Committee (CSC)    SANDIA HEIGHTS LIGHTING    Among the many pleasures of residing in  Sandia Heights are the dark skies which allow  stargazing, watching the moon rise over the  mountains and enjoying the distant sparkling night  lights of Albuquerque. These activities are possible  in large part because of the light regulations of  both Bernalillo County and our Sandia Heights Unit  Covenants.  Per the North Albuquerque Acres and  Sandia Heights Light Pollution Ordinance of the  Bernalillo County Code, all exterior light fixtures  shall be aimable, shielded fixtures so that excessive  light does not cross into adjacent properties,  equipped with motion sensors or automatic timing  devices, and remain off between 11:00 p.m. and  sunrise except for illuminating walkways or  driveways. More detailed information can be found  at:  https://www.municode.com/library/nm/bernalill o_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=BEC OCO_CH30EN_ARTVILIPO.  The various Unit Covenants may have  different wording but all are trying to accomplish  the same purpose: the minimization of the effects  of outdoor lighting on one’s neighbors. Covenant  documents for each Unit may be found at:  http://sandiahomeowners.com/unit-covenants.  When planning new or assessing your  current outdoor lighting, in addition to consulting  the above regulations, think about what impact  your lighting will have upon your neighbors. Will it  shine into their windows or onto their patio? A  little consideration can avoid a complaint to the  Covenant Support Committee and/or to Bernalillo  County. We have a wonderful, unique  neighborhood - let’s keep it that way!        Happy Easter!      Covenant Support Committee    SPRING HAS SPRUNG    Spring is here. Unfortunately, also returning  are the boats and RVs.  When you bought or rented  in Sandia Heights you agreed to follow your Unit  covenants which have restrictions on parking your  recreation vehicles on your lot.  SHHA does not  look for violations, but rather investigates  complaints submitted by your neighbors whose  names are not divulged.  After investigation, if  there is a violation, you will receive a letter asking  you to correct the problem.    PROCEDURES FOR PROPERTY  OWNERS TO AMEND THEIR   UNIT COVENANTS    The Sandia Heights Homeowners  Association (SHHA) cannot modify or change any  unit covenants.  Any covenant changes or  modifications can only be done by the property  owners within their individual unit. SHHA  recognizes the rights of property owners to  amend the covenants of their units in accordance  with procedures set forth in the covenants of each  unit. SHHA has developed information to facilitate  that process and to ensure that a proposed  amendment is in agreement with established  covenants. To avoid potential conflicts with the  existing covenants, it is suggested that the  proposed amendment(s) be presented to the  SHHA Board of Directors for review prior to  initiating a petition signature effort.   The information and steps to initiate a  covenant amendment are available on the  home page of the SHHA website or the  following link: https://Procedures for  Property Owners to Amend Unit  Covenants.pdf.

MARCH 2017 SUMMARY OF ACTIVE   CSC VIOLATIONS:    Unit No.  Type of Suspected  Violation         S5  No Prior ACC Approval     SHHA Court Action   S5  No Prior ACC Approval  3 Files Closed Since the Last GRIT  8   The GRIT – April 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 4                                                                                                     Movie Reviews   by “The SHHA Couch Potato”    The Marvel Cinematic Universe has a lot  of moving parts, including television series and  even new comics, but the heart of that universe  is the series of interlocking feature films that  have been a staple of the movie business over  the last decade.  The Marvel superheroes have  so far been kept busy fighting evil in the  physical world, but with the release of the  newest Marvel superhero flick “Dr. Strange”,  Marvel’s universe has now opened a branch  office in the world of mystical powers and  astral projections.  And no, I’m not talking  about Santa Fe: Dr. Steven Strange’s  headquarters are found at 177A Bleecker Street  in New York City.    This newest of the Marvel superhero  flicks offers plenty of big fun.  A movie about  magic requires a myriad of special effects, and  Dr. Strange delivers the cinematic goods with a  host of color-coded spells, mass urban warping  effects that are more complicated than the  mind- and city-bending effects from  “Inception”, and even a scene-stealing  levitation cloak that deserves an Oscar  nomination for Best Supporting Cardigan.  Between the amazing special effects and the  breakneck pace of the movie’s first hour, don’t  plan on getting up off the couch for a sandwich!    The cast of “Dr. Strange” has more star  power than a typical Oscars’ award ceremony.   Stephen Strange is perfectly over-played by  Benedict Cumberbatch, and the exquisite Tilda  Swinton portrays Strange’s teacher and spirit  guide.  Swinton, as always, steals the show as  The Ancient One (and yes, that’s her name as  listed in the credits).  Rachel McAdams is cast  as Strange’s ER-medic-colleague-and-main- squeeze Dr. Christine Palmer, and the always- dependable Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the Master of  Mystic Arts Karl Mordo, who becomes Strange’s  capable sidekick in the climactic battle against  timeless evil.  Said evil is delivered by Mads  Mikklesen as Kaecilius, a fallen angel of the  mystic realm.     This couch potato has been losing faith  lately in the Marvel movies, because each new  movie seems to be motivated by the mantra of  “more noise and less story”.  Whether it’s  Captain America or Iron Man or even The  Avengers franchise, the early stories are just  more fun and less ponderous than the sundry  sequels.  With “Dr. Strange”, Marvel has clearly  set the stage for new movies starring this  master of mysticism, and here’s hoping that  those future episodes will be as enjoyable as  this initial installment.
