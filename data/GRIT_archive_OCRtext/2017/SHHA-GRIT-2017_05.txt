Meet and Greet Procedures of Conduct:  1. Please silence all cell phones during the meeting.  2. Each speaker is limited to three minutes.    A Note from the Vice President ~ Emily Rudin    May in Sandia Heights—beauty is all around us. The last frost ebbs away,  the soils warm, and plants sprout even in the barest rock crevices. Our  Foothills habitat is alive with wildlife and the renewal of cycles to which  we cannot help but be attuned. Our notorious spring winds are simply  part of our ecosystem, even as they challenge our allergies and dust mops.      We are indeed fortunate to live amid Nature, to sense its daily and  seasonal rhythms along with our own. Many public-health studies have  proven the myriad benefits of being outdoors and experiencing the  natural world. So we welcome the advent of spring and the opportunity to  connect with our environs.    While we’re out and about, let’s take a look at our homes and lots as  others might see them. Are there trees and shrubs that didn’t survive the  winter? Let’s remove them, as the Deed Restrictions call for. Maybe that  gate could use a fresh coat of paint. Or the walls’ stucco needs patching,  last fall’s leaves need raking, or vegetation is too close to the house,  posing a fire hazard. Perhaps those loose or eroded steps, risking safety,  must be replaced.    Although the character of our Sandia Heights neighborhoods is rustic,  benign neglect of properties diminishes their attractiveness and  valuation. Be assured that no external structure, landscape, or amenity is  without the need for maintenance. As you plan for repairs and  improvements, it’s crucial to ensure compliance with your unit’s Deed  Restrictions.

To stay safe walking, follow these rules of the road: 1. Walk on the LEFT Side of the Road Facing Traffic. 2. Cross Safely. Look both ways before crossing any street. Make eye contact with any drivers or bikers who  may be turning. Give them a wave. Make sure they see  you.   3. Walk Single File. This practice is particularly important in this neighborhood, where there are lots of  curves and where traffic has only a split‐second chance  of seeing you before hitting you. Drivers don’t expect to  encounter you walking down the road two or three  abreast, chatting merrily and indifferent to traffic. You  might lose a walking buddy or two!  4. Stay Aware of Bikes and Runners. Share the road and path with bikes and runners. Bike riders should  alert you when approaching from behind with a bike  bell or a "passing on the left/right." Runners should also  call out when about to pass. Bike/walker collisions can  result in broken bones or head injury for either.    Continued on page 3  3   The GRIT – May 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 5                                                                                                    Continued from page 2  5. Be Visible. Wear bright colors when walking in  daytime. When walking at night, wear light‐colored  clothing and a reflective vest ȋstill available for only $ʹ  at the SHHA officeȌ.  6. Be Predictable. Make a practice of staying on left  side of the road while walking rather than weaving  randomly from side to side. Watch your arm motions,  or you may end up giving a black eye to a silently  passing walker, runner, or biker.  7. Keep the Volume Down. Don't drown out your  environment when listening with your earbuds or  headphones. Keep the volume at a level where you can  still hear bike bells and warnings from other walkers  and runners. Your audiologist will also thank you.  8. Hang Up and Eyes Up. Chatting, texting, or playing  games on a mobile device while you walk is as  dangerous as doing those things while driving. Keep  your phone in your pocket, or at least stop in a safe  place to complete your phone tasks.  9. Walk Dogs on Short Leashes. It is terrifying and  tragic to witness dogs running out into traffic or getting  into a dog fight, whether on leash or off leash. But there  is also a danger when walking your pet on a long leash  that you will trip other walkers or bikers. Keep your pet  and yourself safe by learning proper leash walking.  10. Know When to Stop Walking. Heat sickness,  dehydration, heart attack, or stroke can strike walkers  of any age. Learn the symptoms of medical emergencies  and carry a cell phone to dial 9ͳͳ.  Pack Rats  Our Sandia Heights Residents    [Part 2—Destroying the Nests]     “Pack Rats: Our Sandia Heights Residents [Part 1]” was  published in the April GRIT and can be found at the  following link: Pack Rats: Our Sandia Heights Residents  Part 1    Pack rat issues can be solved by creating and  maintaining a pack rat‐free area around your home, and  by eliminating nests and opportunities to build nests on  your property. This means analysis of vehicles parked  outside, vegetation types, and terrain: Is it flat, hilly,  rocky, or sandy?   The key to eliminating and preventing pack rats is  addressing their use and need for shelter. Eliminating  nests as well as potential nesting sites is critical.   • You cannot control the food supply ‐ the desert  provides all they need.  • You cannot control how many rats are on adjacent  properties.  • You can only control nest and nesting opportunities  on your property.    1. Inspection   Locate existing nests and potential nesting sites in the  area.   2. Live Traps   Catching and removing the rat is essential before taking  out a nest, or it will seek shelter and build a new nest  elsewhere. Capture traps are readily available on the  web and at local pet supply shops.  Have‐a‐Heart is a  popular brand and, depending on size, usually sells for  under $ʹͲ.  Suggested bait is a wet spoonful of peanut  butter and oatmeal mix.  Once captured, the rats can be  released in several open areas directly on the east side  of the Sandias.  They are harmless to handle in the trap.   Do not do this in the winter months, as the pack rats  will become trapped overnight and eventually freeze to  death before the morning sun warms the air.  If  interested call the SHHA office, as there are residents  who can answer questions and can quite possibly loan  out traps.   There are some, very few, critter control companies  that advertise they trap and release in another area.   Check them out very carefully as it is too easy just to kill  the critters.  Most of these companies will not bother to  relocate the rats.  3. Nest Treatment   Once the resident pack rat is removed, parasites and  other pests may be living in the nest. These pests can  move outwards if the nest is not promptly treated.   4. Remove the Nest   Within ʹ4 hours of removing the resident rat, the nest  needs to be completely destroyed before another rat  moves in. Here is a list of items needed: Safety glasses,  dust mask, heavy gloves ȋdo not touch any nest itemȌ,  long‐handled, flat‐bladed shovel and garden rake ȋto  pull the nest apartȌ, loppers ȋto cut up debris in order to  box itȌ, and large cardboard boxes. All debris should be  removed. Any hidden underground chambers need to  be located and filled in. Boxes can then be brought to  the land‐fill or Convenience Center.  5. Environmental Change at the Nest Site  Rats like to go where rats have been, and even after  catching the resident rat and removing the nest, other  rats may try to rebuild in the same area. Thinning,  trimming, and possibly adding soil need to be  performed in the immediate area to prevent new  nesting. In some cases rat‐proofing, especially in car  engines and grills, is needed to keep rats from nesting  in those places.  6. Prevention   Pack rats need a sheltered area to feel secure enough to  start a new nest. Deny them protection and they will  move on.   4   The GRIT – May 2017 – Volume 33 – No. 5                                                                                                       MARCH CALLS TO SANDIA HEIGHTS SECURITY PATROL    The following statistics are the latest provided by Sandia Heights Security since the last GRIT.

This article begins a GRIT series that explains why  using parliamentary procedure is so important.    1 - Why Use Parliamentary Procedure?    The use of parliamentary procedure:    1.  Helps an organization achieve its purpose. Business conducted in meetings focuses on purposes  stated in the bylaws.  2.   Provides equal treatment for all. Each member has the right to speak; rules determine how many  times and for how long one can speak.  3.  Expedites business and saves time. Attendees are not allowed to introduce delaying issues; the  skilled presiding officer keeps the meeting moving.  4.  Maintains order. Rules allow the skilled presiding officer to guide the meeting in an orderly manner.  Members who know parliamentary rules help keep order.  5.  Protects the right of the majority to decide. Business brought before the assembly with motions or  resolutions is adopted by a majority or a two‐thirds vote.  6.  Protects the right of the minority to be heard. Debate can be conducted in a way that each side of  an issue has equal time to be heard. Minority reports are heard on some votes.  7.  Protects the rights of members. Members have the right to make motions or introduce resolutions,  to debate, and to vote.  8.  Protects the rights of absentees. Minutes of the meeting inform absentees of the proceedings.  Previous notice is needed for introduction of some types of motions.  9.  Helps members understand the universal rules that are useful in any organization. Meetings of  large numbers of members require more formality; meetings of small groups or committees may be  conducted with less formality.  10.  Makes for meetings that members want to attend. When there is order, business is  accomplished within a reasonable time limit, and members gladly attend and participate.

This is done to preserve the  enjoyment of the night sky. Regardless of the  individual covenants for your Unit, the entire North  Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights fall under  the Bernalillo County ȋBerncoȌ Code for light  pollution. The code includes, but is not restricted to,  security lighting, street lights, landscape lights,  building‐mounted area lights, and building façade  lights. In general, lights shall remain OFF between  ͳͳ:ͲͲ pm and sunrise; lights on buildings shall be  mounted no higher than ͳ͸ feet and all lights must  be shielded so the light is directed perpendicular to  the ground; bulbs should not be more than ͹ͷ  watts.      To see the entire code and for exceptions, go to the  Bernalillo County Website ȋwww.bernco.govȌ and  look under ordinances, Section ͵Ͳ‐ͳͺ͸. If you leave  your lights on at the entry, garage doors, or house  floods after ͳͳ:ͲͲpm and they are not shielded,  they are in violation of the county code. While the  CSC does not enforce county ordinances, we will  work with folks to make them aware of their  options. At night, even a 4Ͳwatt bulb in an  unshielded fixture can be a distraction to those that  wish to enjoy the night sky, the darkness of the  neighborhood, or the lights of the city below.        Bernco can help with light pollution    SHHA cannot enforce county codes and ordinances  such as light, noise, traffic, and on‐street parking.   Only what is stated in the covenants can be  enforced by SHHA. However, the county will  enforce their ordinances, including those for light  pollution.  Recently a homeowner filed a covenant violation  with SHHA citing a large number of outdoor lights  located at a property across the street which were  shining into their living room and bedroom  windows.  There are ͵͸ units in Sandia Heights,  each with their own set of covenants, but with  regard to lighting most state ǲNo un‐shaded flood  lights shall be maintained which cause light directly  into the homes of other residents in the  Subdivision.ǳ  In this particular case there were no  bare flood lights and therefore with a strict, legal  interpretation of the covenants the SHHA could not  act.  As a result the complainant was informed that  there was no covenant violation but there might be  a violation of the county lighting ordinances.    As a result the homeowner proceeded to file a  violation complaint with Bernalillo County. This can  be done on‐line and provides a tracking number so  you can log in and review their investigation. In this  case the county investigator visited the alleged  violator’s property within a couple of weeks and  found that there were several issues that would be  an ordinance violation and needed to be addressed.   This resulted in Bernco giving the homeowner a  month to complete corrective actions.    If you would like to know more about Bernalillo  County Ordinances visit  http://www.bernco.gov/planning/ordinances‐ codes.aspx.

The application forms  are not difficult to fill out and are available at the  SHHA office and online at the SHHA website  (www.sandiahomeowners.org). Make sure the  application is complete. If you are not sure how to  fill it out, the SHHA staff will provide assistance.  Remember that small projects such as reroofing,  restuccoing, and repainting, even if the new  materials and colors will match existing ones,  require the application form. Many of these  applications can be approved within a few days.  More extensive construction projects will, of  course, take longer to review and approve.    All applications approved by the ACC are listed  each month in the GRIT under the heading ǲACC  Activity Log.ǳ Occasionally, a resident will notify  the ACC of ongoing construction that is not listed  on the log. In these cases, the ACC will determine if  the construction has been approved and, if not, will  contact the property owner to ask that they submit  an after‐the‐fact application. Residents can also  submit a complaint to the Covenant Support  Committee ȋCSCȌ regarding ongoing construction  and/or landscaping that is not shown on the log,  and this complaint will be forwarded to the ACC. In  these latter situations, the ACC will also request an  after‐the‐fact application for review. Correcting  after‐the‐fact changes to your property can be  difficult and expensive if the ACC does not approve  some or all of the project. Save yourself the hassle  of this kind of situation by applying to the ACC for  approval before you undertake the project.      The ACC is here to help you, so please take  advantage of our expertise and keep us in the loop  when planning and executing your project. We are  willing to work with you to make your remodeling  experiences as pleasant as possible.
