The SHHA is launching initiatives for local park improvements, dependent on sufficient financial backing. The initiatives include a membership drive and an open invitation from Evelyn Patten for residents to join SHHA, as well as securing new board members. Commitment to sustainability is highlighted by all association documents being printed on recycled paper. Furthermore, SHHA is contemplating plans for the Paseo del Norte Highway/Freeway, including a contract for a study on alternative routes and a review of upgrades to a significant portion, from 1 25 to Tramway. The association is also elated about the upcoming construction of a new local elementary school. SHHA pledges to continuously work towards the community's betterment and encourages unity, while promoting themselves as the top choice for real estate properties in Sandia Heights.
