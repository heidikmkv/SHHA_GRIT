In summary: The SHHA had their 2016 annual meeting on February 6, where the president reported on several key issues. Developments included an update on Mhoon property zoning, integration of North Tramway Estates (NTE) responsibilities, collaboration with the County on a Vehicle Seizure and Forfeiture Ordinance to manage drag racing issues, a new metal sculpture proposal for WL Jackson park, hiring Amanda Allen as the new Office Administrator, and a review of HOA procedures for compliance. The Mhoon property zoning was changed from A 1 to R 2 unanimously by the SHHA board, leading to a mediated settlement that required several provisions including the implementation of an SUP and withdrawal of the R 2 zoning request among others. The SHHA served the community by publishing 2015 year end financials, offering relevant info through the sandiahomeowners.org website, maintaining SHHA office technology infrastructure, encouraging community safety with the help of Sandia Heights Security, and helping homeowners deal with various issues. The association offered tram passes to members, and real estate associate broker Greg Lobberegt listed several properties in Sandia Heights for sale. SHHA ended the year with 1731 members, amounting to 82% of total households. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) focused on remodeling projects in 2015, recording a total of 324 projects. Several residences and townhomes in Sandia Heights were listed for sale, sold, or pending sale. The Sandia Heights Backyard Ski Area received over 100 inches of snowfall and offers services like downhill and cross country skiing to SHHA members. The SHHA office provides services including notary, copying and faxing, email alerts and a contractor evaluation binder. A board meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, March 9 at the office at 7pm. The SHHA will continue to monitor community concerns and post responses on its website.
