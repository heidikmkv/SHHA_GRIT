The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) in Albuquerque is led by a board of officials and provides guidelines regulating changes to residences and handling emergencies. Plans requiring ACC approval involve any external changes like re roofing, restuccoing, landscaping, and installing solar panels. Immediate repairing is permissible only during emergencies, while any non emergency upgrades demand approval. Recommendations for protecting homes while away and dealing with scams are also provided. Homes built since 1983 should have National Flood Insurance, and residents are encouraged to coexist with snakes, which serve in controlling rodent populations. Emergency contact numbers and services provided by Sandia Heights Services (SHS) are listed. SHS offerings include water, sewer, trash collection, recycling, and security. However, SHS subscriptions are separate from SHHA membership and Sandia Heights Security membership. Real estate market activity in Sandia Heights is diverse, with a range of sizes and prices. A custom contemporary home by Roger Smith is for sale, with potential snake encounters being a natural part of life in Sandia Heights. Advice on cohabiting with snakes is given, with safety measures suggested in case of snake bites. The text also lists home maintenance violations and the benefits of SHHA membership, including local business discounts. Approved projects range from repaintings to landscape maintenance, with ongoing projects and advertised properties noted. Community events include the Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour and "Cork & Fork" dinner group gatherings. Administrative information like office hours, board meeting details, and classified ads are also included.
