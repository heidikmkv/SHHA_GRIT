The SHHA consists of several administrators including President Joe Pappe, Vice President Josephine Porter, Secretary George Connor, and Treasurer Woody Farber who operate out of an office in Albuquerque on weekdays from 9 am 4 pm. The recent completion of a dirt path from Tramway Blvd to Jackson Park by Bernalillo County provides a convenient route for residents, eliminating the need to use Cedar Hill road. SHHA is currently seeking resident input on platforms for the GRIT newsletter, with a focus on cost effective, eco friendly electronic distribution, and calling for volunteer participation in community oriented services and covenant enforcement. The 10.40 acre property‑Tract 5, Lands of Mhoon‑was granted a Special Use Permit for Planned Development by the Board of County Commission on May 3, 2016. Bernalillo County will also be hosting the "Movies in the Park" summer series, complete with food for purchase at select venues, and residents can gain additional information through the provided contact. Residents are advised to report noise disturbances to Bernalillo County, while property covenant violations should be reported by SHHA members to the Covenant Support Committee. The SHHA security patrol logged 310 calls in the previous month, with the most prevalent types being special requests and suspicious vehicles. Detailed real estate services are provided by seasoned Executive Brokers Sharon and Judson McCollum. Their 2016 market analysis shows a consistent activity rate, with properties of varying sizes selling at an average price of $158.94 and $156.35 per square foot respectively. Active covenant violations, to be countered with written notifications and potential legal action, include home maintenance, lighting, and trash bin issues. Recommendations for home remodeling projects include hiring licensed, insured contractors and secure necessary building permits. Additionally, the SHHA has partnerships offering Member Benefits Programs with various local businesses. Upcoming community events include the Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour and the eleventh cycle of the "Cork & Fork" dinner group. Office hours, meeting updates, member services, and other key information can be found on the SHHA website.
