The SHHA in Albuquerque, NM, is led by Joe Pappe (President), Bob Bower (Vice President), George Connor (Secretary), and Woody Farber (Treasurer), along with Amanda Allen (Administrator) and Betsy Rodriguez (Administrative Assistant) who handle daily operations. The association is aware of escalating crime levels and is addressing community related security by liaising with Sandia Heights Services (SHS) and Bernalillo County Sheriffâ€™s Office (BCSO), exploring measures such as home security enhancements, surveillance cameras, and changes to unit covenants. The SHHA encourages active resident engagement with local officers and county commissioner Lonnie Talbert. Recreational activities include skiing on the east side of the Sandia Mountains, made affordable and accessible for residents. SHHA encourages resident safety during the holiday season to prevent burglary and theft. Sandia Heights Security Patrol can offer special security watch for absent homeowners, despite persistent issues like mail theft. The SHHA is exploring real estate developments through Sharon and Judson McCollum from RE/MAX to increase property values. SHHA members can access discounts via www.sandiahomeowners.org, while volunteering opportunities are available with the Covenant Support Committee (CSC). Holiday season brings reminders about considerate lighting, parking, and trash disposal, while ACC approved projects are shared for transparency. High end listed properties feature a wide range of luxury amenities, and another property is under contract. SHHA also offers daily free Tram passes, and has organized a meeting aiming to engage the community and address issues. The Association, operating from Monday to Friday, 9am to 4pm, encourages active resident involvement and will see an increase in TRAM pass costs from January 1, 2017.
