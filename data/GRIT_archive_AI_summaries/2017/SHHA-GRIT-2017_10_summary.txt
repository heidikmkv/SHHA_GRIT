President Joe Pappe of the Association has reported concerns about a dearth of volunteers willing to serve on the Board of Directors, an issue threatening the Association's continuation into 2019; this could result in the loss of services, committees, and the potential drop in property values due to lack of architectural and covenant enforcement. The future of the Association will be decided in November, however, residents are encouraged to volunteer to ensure the continuation of services. Updates prompt residents to verify their Resident Directory listing, follow property rental rules, and report drone invasion of privacy to the County Commissioner. The Sandia Heights' Homeowners Association is unable to act on anonymous correspondence; Residents are advised to view updates on their website. Community security reports have been revealed including cases of vandalism and animal control issues, and the Homeowners Association is organising an annual photo contest for the cover of the 2018 Resident Guide. The Association cautions against feeding local wildlife which disrupts ecosystems and may violate State Wildlife laws. The need for a new Chair for the Communications and Publications Committee has been expressed; the commitment measures up to 15 hours a month involving various duties related to internal and external communication. The Association has also implemented a discount initiative with various local merchants. In observation of Columbus Day, the SHHA office will be closed on October 9th, 2017; Membership cards and tram passes are purchasable at discounted rates for members. Community events include concerts with the Albuquerque Philharmonic Orchestra, worship times at St Chad's Episcopal Church, and auditions for New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus.
