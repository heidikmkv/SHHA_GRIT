Vice President Emily Rudin of the SHHA thanked members for attending the Annual Meeting on February 4 and encouraged their involvement in community matters including local ordinances, safety, and new constructions. Secretary Bob Bower stated past meeting information would be available on the SHHA website, and highlighted an article on garden maintenance and local wildlife issues. The article also discussed security statistics and prevention measures for burglaries in the area, advised by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office, including forming relationships with neighbours and reporting suspicious activities. Residents are also reminded to comply with lighting and parking regulations to maintain the neighbourhoodâ€™s pleasure and safety. The SHHA offers guidance to residents who wish to propose covenant amendments and provides updates on violation activities. The SHHA newsletter also includes film reviews, most recently praising the Marvel movie "Dr. Strange". In terms of architecture, several properties were permitted for improvements, and real estate executive brokers Judson and Sharon McCollum, who have a 25 year history with Sandia Heights, continue to promote properties in the area. Three modern homes in the Sandia Heights area were highlighted for their luxury features and expansive views. The SHHA sponsors events and services including member benefits such as office resources, safety vests, tram passes, and community wide activities.
