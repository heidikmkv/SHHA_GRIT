Joe Pappe, President of the GRIT Association, raised concerns about the future of the organization due to insufficient volunteers, potentially leading to dissolution, but recent volunteers and proposed structural changes to the Board and Committee have led to increased optimism. An annual meeting in February aims to propose changes for membership voting to protect future organizational sustainability. The Association reinforces the importance of submitting architectural project applications to the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) for community guideline adherence. To prevent covenant violation, the ACC requires plat plans or surveys for significant construction projects and encourages members to consult with them for project advice. Open Board meetings, held the second Wednesday each month, welcome all membersâ€™ comments and concerns. Winter preparations for water pipes are advised, and violations like trash accumulation and lack of ACC approval are noted. In September 2017, 257 calls were logged, with 193 being special requests, alongside issues such as alarms, theft, and loud music. SHHA listed benefits and participating merchants offering discounts to members. Articles emphasized covenant adherence, appropriate vehicle storage, and landscaping guidelines. Issues like pinon tree fungi infection are also monitored. The GRIT, ACC, Sandia Heights Services, and SHHA work collaboratively on various community projects, available for reference on the Sandia Homeowners website. SHHA responded to crime concerns with eight new "Area Patrolled by Security" signs, in partnership with the Parks and Safety Committee and local law enforcement. SHHA offers various free services and resources for its members, including notarization, photocopies, e mail alerts, and contractor evaluations. Paid resources like safety vests, tram passes, and classified ads are offered online. The SHHA Office, located at 2 B San Rafael Ave. NE, observes holiday closures, and resources like the ACC Color Reference Guide are available for lending, with cash or check payments accepted for sales and deposits.
