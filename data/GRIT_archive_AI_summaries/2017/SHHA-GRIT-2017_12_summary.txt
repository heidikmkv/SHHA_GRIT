In October and November, nine volunteers joined the Board of Directors of the SHHA, alleviating a crucial staffing shortage. These new members bring a variety of experiences and innovative ideas, intending to better serve the SHHA's members. The association disseminated information on how to limit unsolicited marketing calls, mail, and emails by registering for the Federal Trade Commission's National Do Not Call Registry or the Direct Marketing Association's mail and commercial email reduction options. Residents were reminded of the covenants against storing large vehicles such as RVs and commercial trucks on their properties. They were also urged to utilize forms on the association's website to report any violations, ensuring anonymity. The community was encouraged to enjoy outdoor walks, provided they adhere to safety guidelines such as walking on the left side of the road and maintaining a 2 ft clearance of vegetation from the road. The American Red Cross, in partnership with the Bernalillo County Fire Department, is offering free smoke detector installations. Meanwhile, residents were reminded that membership in the SHHA does not cover security, water, sewer, and waste collection services. The GRIT, the association's newsletter, provided tips for holiday lighting safety, snow removal, and avoiding rodent poison. An article on poinsettia care throughout the seasons was featured, and the SHHA's recent events, including a Volunteer Appreciation Luncheon and new project approvals, were highlighted. Additionally, the community was informed about a new local coffee shop and social activities such as "Cork & Fork" bimonthly group dinners. The association posted their office hours and a reminder to check their website for member benefits. Lastly, SHHA's special office schedule for Christmas and New Year was conveyed to the community members.
