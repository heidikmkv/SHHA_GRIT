Sandia Heights' locals will showcase their talents at an Arts and Crafts Bazaar on Saturday, November 14 to benefit the Volunteer Fire District, featuring local art, crafts and food. The Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association (HOA) urges residents to be more aware and active regarding community issues, like the water rate hike which they secured a three year freeze for instead of challenging it. Among other topics discussed at their board meetings are snow plowing costs, covenant violations, zoning changes, and park upkeep. The community is reminded to adhere to neighborhood rules, like noise control and proper storage of recreational vehicles. Other community news includes a range of offerings, services and events. Lost and found items, a typing service, holiday shopping items, home deliveries of the Tribune, a neighborhood bazaar, a needlepoint event, and a house sale are also noted. The GRIT publication encourages contributions by December 1, 1981. Further offerings and events consisted of a gallery for sale, Christmas trees sold by Lobo women's sports teams, babysitting services, a found gray kitten, a bicycle for sale, and an aluminum cans collection by a Scout troop. Sandia Tram Gift Shop promotes its Christmas gifts and an art and collectibles store is featured.
