On November 14, 1981, the Sandia Heights Neighborhood held an Arts & Crafts Bazaar at the Tram's foot fire station. This successful event featured a wide variety of items for sale, such as dolls, watercolors, handcrafted goods, bread, puzzles, pottery, and Girl Scouts' baked goods. With strong community participation, the bazaar raised approximately $2,900, which included a $276 donation to the Volunteer Fire District #5. Participating artists and craftsmen also displayed their work at multiple galleries, and a future bazaar was announced for either October 30th or November 13th. In addition, many Sandia Heights residents have been contributing to the development of the New Mexico Ronald McDonald House. This facility is intended as a temporary home and support center for families with children undergoing long term medical treatment. The location in Sandia Heights is undergoing a $300,000 first phase construction, intending to provide eight bedrooms, a manager's apartment, and common areas. The goal is to eventually expand the house to accommodate up to twenty four bedrooms. Currently, the project has received $180,000 in donations as well as donated goods and services to offset costs. Additional volunteers and donations are still welcomed to help reach the goal.
