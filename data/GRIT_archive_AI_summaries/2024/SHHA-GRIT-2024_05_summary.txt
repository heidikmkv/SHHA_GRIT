The SHHA management and daily operation is led by President Jim Stewart, VP Eric Faulring, Secretary Martin Kirk, Treasurer Randy Tripp, with Office Director Diane Barney and Lead Administrator Trish Lovato carrying out daily operations from the office at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE. Key activities include discussions on universal membership, younger board member inclusion, financial transparency, and incorporating neighbor feedback. SHHA features a president's message on ongoing activities in the association, their planned board meeting on April 10, 2024, the Sandia Heights security services distinction from SHHA, and guidelines for services, such as notary and copy services. The text also outlines geological features in the Sandia Heights region, including reddish Chinle rocks and brown coarse grained rocks, with an emphasis on Low Angle Normal Faults. It provides warnings against unsafely attracting bears through ill management of food waste and congratulates local artist Sharon Arendt for her acrylic work. The locals are encouraged to maintain the natural beauty of their homes while controlling invasive tumbleweeds and adhering to leash laws. Homeowners are also introduced to the new affiliate membership of the Sandia Heights Artists group and the bi monthly Cork & Fork dinners.
