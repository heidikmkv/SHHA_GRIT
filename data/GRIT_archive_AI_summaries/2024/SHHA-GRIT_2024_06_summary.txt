The Sandia Homeownersâ€™ Association document outlines operational details, contact information, board members, and office staff. The roles include Jim Stewart as President, Eric Faulring as Vice President, Martin Kirk as Secretary, Randy Tripp as Treasurer, Diane Barney as Office Director, and Trish Lovato as Lead Administrator, among others. The President's June 2024 message discusses ongoing issues and initiatives within the community as well as the history of the Cosme Garcia homestead in North Sandia Heights. Board discussions revolve around universal membership, engaging with the community newspaper The GRIT, and acknowledging long serving members. The homestead's history includes its use for grazing and cultivation, while the remnants of the homestead show indications of deterioration amidst an encroaching residential complex. A total of 148 neighborhood related calls was documented in June 2024, covering a wide range of matters, from alarms to pet nuisances. The GRIT also features profiles of local artists such as Deborah Griswold, who upcycles materials into beautiful artworks, and Ariel Foster, a talented musician turned teacher and watercolor artist. The community's sanitation service provider Sandia Heights Services offers assistance for disabled residents, and there are ongoing home improvement projects within the community. Lastly, recreational activities like the Duke City Bridge Club and the "Cork & Fork" Dining Activity are picking up again, with residents encouraged to join. Details about these updates, news, and initiatives can be found on both the SHHA website and The GRIT publication.
