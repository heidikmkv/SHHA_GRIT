The SHHA, which covers 2200 properties with 1800 members, successfully held its annual meeting with its board directors and office team. President Roger Hagengruber announced his departure while the association ensured financial stability even with increased dues and ticket costs. The team welcomed new members Diane Barney, Trish Lovato, and Holly Sylvester. These changes, along with various improvements, were documented in a video, now accessible on SHHA's website. The organization also completely implemented a Consent Agenda for optimized Board meetings. Detailed contributions from several committees include: The Architectural Control Committee managed over 300 projects, keeping a log on the SHHA website. The Communications and Publications unit continually upgrades the resident database interface and the SHHA website, which now includes the 2024 Residents Guide and Directory. The Community Service and Membership team focused on enhancing member benefits, increasing households to 1885 by year's end. The Covenant Support Committee guided residents to adhere to covenants through complaint forms and "Good Neighbor" letters, but faced challenges with Airbnb like violations and invasive elm trees. The Environment & Safety Committee emphasized wildfire risk reduction and encouraged community spirit through various activities. Lastly, the SHHA office sells safety vests at $3 per vest and Tram pass tickets, available on a first come, first served basis. Note that the Tram will undergo upgrades from January 9 to March 13, 2024.
