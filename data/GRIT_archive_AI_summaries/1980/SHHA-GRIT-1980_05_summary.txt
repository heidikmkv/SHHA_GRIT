The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association detailed various updates and notices in their May 15, 1980 newsletter: Their fiscal year will end on June 1, 1980, with their Annual Meeting set for June 4 at the Firehouse. Three board members are due to be replaced for three year terms at this meeting. The association reported on the ongoing playground grassing program which has cost approximately $9000, causing a minor deficit in the treasury. They sought contributions to alleviate this deficit and fund new projects, such as a bike and jogging path. Other announcements included increased guard service, a pet containment reminder for residents, and a warning regarding fraudulent "landscapers". The newsletter also contained advertisements for various services and praised the efforts leading to the resurfacing and striping of Tramway Boulevard. A continued sensitivity towards children during summer months was requested, as was participation in the swim team. The costs for coaching services were outlined at $22.00 for the first child and $18.00 for each additional child per family, funded by family dues. Coach Livy was confirmed to be returning. There was a plea for contributions to the discontinued "GRIT" publication and a reference to Alvarado Realty Co. The newsletter concluded with an unclear reference to "Miller Jometack Bear Ry NE stBuaueRuUE."
