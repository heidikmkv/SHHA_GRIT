On November 13, 1979, nearly 100 Sandia Heights residents attended a homeowner's board meeting during which County Representative Wray Simmons discussed issues related to county services, particularly Tramway Blvd. While the community often feels neglected, concerted action led to the Bernalillo County Commission approving funds for Tramway Blvd's resurfacing. Simmons encouraged residents to voice their concerns related to roads, dogs, police protection etc, to their commissioners to further improve the community. Residents were also asked to financially support the community's main security, the guard service, which operates 70 72 hours a week. Letters received by the GRIT showed residents recently voiced concerns about problems caused by stray dogs and road safety due to the hilly and low visibility nature of the roads. Additionally, future local events and services were announced, including a ski trip, a need for Scrabble players, and a sale of items. Babysitters were reminded to send in their details and there was a call for children interested in summer jobs. Home safety reminders were also issued. The self contained Sandia Heights community, housing around 650 residences and governed by Fire District #5, is proud of its water service, waste disposal system, and roads, developed primarily by communityâ€™s developers: Alvarado Realty Company, Sandia Peak Tram Company, and Sandia Peak Ski Company. Not only do these companies fund improvements to community facilities, but they also facilitate recreational facilities, like the Four Seasons Club with swimming and tennis, horse stables, and the Sandia Peak Tramway for outdoor activities. The community also provides direct access to two restaurants, The Firehouse and High Finance.
