On July 24th, the SHHA Board of Directors elected their new officers, including President Jim Ciraulo, Treasurer Bob Hoffer, Vice President Bill Johnson, and Secretary Beth Overacker. The Board has planned several projects for the upcoming year, such as finalizing Sandia Heights Park's landscaping, monitoring guard patrol services, contracting snow removal, providing new members with area maps, and enhancing Tramway Road. A resident interest survey is also being conducted. Maintenance responsibilities for roads and drainages have been delegated by Bernalillo County to the Tram Company, backed by the Homeowner's Association. Residents were asked to report road issues to the County's corresponding departments and also to clear blocked culverte around their homes. Moreover, a local publication, The Grit, highlighted the substantial contribution made by the Guard Service during the past year. Guards have reportedly assisted in several burglary arrests, addressed vandalism issues, performed tasks like monitoring homes of vacationing residents, and responded to multiple emergency calls. Finally, the publication included various advertisements for buying/selling items and services, from a girlâ€™s bicycle and an 8 piece dining room set to window cleaning and math tutoring. The publication also advertised opportunities for job services and requests for trading skills.
