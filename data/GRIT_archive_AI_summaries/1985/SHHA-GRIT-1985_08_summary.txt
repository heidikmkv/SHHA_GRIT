On June 1, 1985, the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association held its annual general meeting, during which presentations were given on the plague by Curt Montman and on covenant monitoring success. Five residents were elected to a three year term on the Board of Directors: Lynne Behnfield, Jerry Boucher, Judy Harris, Bill Jackson, and Don McBride. The neighborhood "Tiny Triathalon" was deemed successful. The association commenced its new fiscal year on July 1, with dues due for community activities. Concerns were raised over nine major fires in the district, mostly caused by illegal fireworks, with the most significant one being the Juniper Hill fire. In response to this, the association aims to enforce a fireworks ban within the community to prevent endangering lives and property. The community was asked to respect restrictions in place and was reminded about the upcoming events. The association has petitioned the Bernalillo County government to address traffic and safety issues on Tramway Boulevard. Requests include street light installations, left hand turn lanes at major intersections, and plans to make the boulevard a four lane thoroughfare. Community support is sought for these improvements. Community residents Matthew Neal and Tom Reed offer their services for odd jobs and marine examinations, respectively. Mothers in the community are encouraged to exchange babysitting services, with Marie Rundle as the point of contact. A recipe for 'Aunt Linda's Praline Cookies' has been shared, and the Prince of Peace Catholic Community invites all to their Sunday Mass. Lastly, the association reminds residents about the member directory with their contact information and committee positions.
