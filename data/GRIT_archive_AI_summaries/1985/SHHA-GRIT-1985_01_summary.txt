Six months into their tenure, the Sandia Heights Board of Directors have reported progress towards their objectives with significant contributions from board members Harry Criel and Harry Ottinger. The Board's key areas of focus include: A community directory initiative led by Criel that will be delivered to paying members. A campaign led by Ottinger for improvements to Tramway Boulevard, which will be presented to the County Commission. Legal action against covenant violators, emphasizing the need for robust membership for financial strength. Addressing traffic and road safety issues, particularly at the intersections of Live Oak/Tramway Blvd and Tramway Lane/Tramway Blvd, and compensating Sandia Peak Tram Co. for snow plowing and road salting. A petition for expedited improvements to Tramway Boulevard and an 'ultimate' plan for expanding it into a four lane separated thoroughfare. Neighborhood security measures including a patrol cart, security decals, and a security guard who can provide emergency medical assistance and manage non emergency situations. Additionally, the association is responsible for enforcing Class I and II covenants for the maintenance of a harmonious living environment and has recently announced a Christmas decoration contest, the appointment of a new board member, W.H.B. Jackson, and a schedule for a community event. Sandia Heights residential directories will become available on February 1st for those who have paid membership dues, and there are various neighborhood activities for residents to partake in along with an opportunity to see a solar demonstration for discontent homeowners with high utility bills.
