The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association has scheduled its annual meeting for Thursday, June 5, 1980, at 7:00 PM at the Fire Station. The agenda items include: Reading of minutes Treasurer's report, which indicates current financial shortage of $700 and pending bill of $2,000 for playground seeding Reports on the neighborhood's status Old business New business, including plans for a bicycle and jogging path Election of new board members Given these financial challenges, particularly an expected total cost of $8,000 for a new playground and automated sprinkling system, the association strongly urges resident contributions. These funds will be allocated to crucial services such as road maintenance, newsletter production, and the employment of a playground supervisor. A copy of the area map drafted by Bob Hoffer is included for reference, alongside attached plague information for review.
