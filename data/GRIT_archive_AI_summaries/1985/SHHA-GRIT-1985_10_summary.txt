The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association President, Rob Freeman, thanked the community members for their annual membership dues contributions, which fund neighborhood services such as snow removal, covenant monitoring, and dissemination of advisories on various topics e.g., infrastructure developments, pet safety guidelines, details of the annual house decoration contest, environmental upkeep and waste management recommendations. The Association's Treasurer emphasized the reliance of the non profit organization on these $30 membership dues, breaking down expenditures into administration, playground maintenance, snow removal, publications and a legal fund for potential covenant violator court cases. They urged homeowners to pay their dues for maintaining Sandia Heights as a pleasant community. Ernest and Nora from Finca La Floresta Apple Orchard have praised the local community and welcomed visits, especially during the apple blossom season from April 20 25, with a special invite for teachers to bring student groups. In other letters, Russell and Alicia Snyder thanked Bob Murphy, President of Sandia Peak Tram Company, for improving dangerous road conditions on Juniper Hill. Moreover, an appeal was made to members to continue supporting the Association by paying annual dues, specifically to fund a creative needlepoint project, and to participate in the forthcoming neighborhood survey.
