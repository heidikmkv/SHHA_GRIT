The Sandia Heights/Bernalillo County residents are encouraged to vote "YES" in the coming General Election for the Recreational Bond Package(#3), promising benefits like a $2M BioPark River Otter Exhibit. The appeal on Mhoon property was denied by the County Commissions, allowing a 30 home residential development on the property. This region highly commends Linda and Kerney Bolton for developing the SHHA Coffeehouse Concert Series in Sandia Heights from 2005 to 2014. The SHHA membership ensures various perks including local merchant discounts, pedestrian safety tips, and home security patrol services. SHHA members also have a Septic System Update and are reminded to clarify their details for the 2015 Resident Directory and Guide. A food drive is organised in collaboration with the Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico. Mail theft is a pressing issue and residents are advised to secure their outgoing mail. Risk of plague and tularemia from deceased animals have been reported so caution in handling is advised. Renters in Sandia Heights can enjoy most SHHA perks, excluding voting rights and lodging covenant violation complaints. The SHHA also encourages residents to report vegetation causing visibility hindrance and issues with the approved projects. For maintenance of vegetation within the county's right of way, the Bernalillo County Contact Center can be reached. Notably, the SHHA office hours are 9 AM to 4 PM, Monday to Friday, but it will be closed on Columbus Day. Residents can stay updated on various AGMs and other proceedings through emails and website alerts. A photo contest hosted by SHHA has the deadline for submissions on November 7 and the winning photo will feature on the 2015 Annual Directory of SHHA.
