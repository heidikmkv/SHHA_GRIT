The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) has announced its 2014 officer election results: President Ann Zimmerman, Vice President Joe Pappe, Secretary George Connor, and Treasurer Ann Marie Caffrey. Board members Joe Pappe and Michael Pierce will stand for re election for a 3 year term at the Annual Meeting on February 8, 2014. The meeting will introduce new officers, present committee chairs, and host elections for returning board members. Notable upcoming events include a performance by jazz guitarist Greg Ruggiero exclusively for SHHA members on February 15, 2014. The SHHA website has been updated, allowing members to alter information and access to exclusive features such as the Tram pass availability. The Association has also bought eight corporate tram passes per day, details of which are on the website. Volunteering opportunities are available for those interested, with the required qualifications being a desire to help the community, available time, a willingness to work, and the ability to work with others. The “Letters to the Editor” feature allows community discussions but is regulated to maintain relevance and avoid personal attacks. The SHHA encourages practices such as spreading laundry loads, minimizing household cleaner usage, limiting food waste disposal, and using septic friendly items for maintaining septic care. The Association stresses that the Sandia Heights Services, which provides utilities and security services, is separate from SHHA membership. Residents are reminded of various safety measures, such as using the correct side of the road when walking, wearing reflective vests in low light conditions, proper dog waste disposal, careful driving, and reporting safety concerns to the SHHA office. Additional free services for SHHA members are also highlighted, including notarization, copies, faxes, tram passes, email alerts, and contractor evaluations. Lastly, advice is available regarding contracting issues, with the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department's Construction Industries Division website recommended for extra information. A contractor evaluation binder is available at the SHHA office for comment and review. The Annual Meeting and Town Hall Meeting Standing Rules and services offered by the Church of the Good Shepherd are also outlined.
