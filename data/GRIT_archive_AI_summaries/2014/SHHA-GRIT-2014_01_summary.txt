The Sandia Heights Homeowner Association (SHHA) is hosting a concert on January 11 with Boston based musician, Greg Klyma, at the Church of The Good Shepherd, which is open to all ages with varying rates depending on age and membership status. SHHA has their annual membership meeting scheduled on February 8, 2014, where new officers will be introduced, returning board members voted in, and members can voice their concerns. The SHHA website offers benefits such as the availability of tram passes and discounts at local merchants, as well as features the 2014 Photo Gallery with photo submissions from the community. SHHA and Bernalillo County have received two Special Use Permit requests for residential building sites, with hearings being deferred until 2014. A holiday food drive was successful, and SHHA reminded members of the difference between their membership and the separate services provided by Sandia Heights Services (SHS). SHHA office alerts and newsletters can be obtained digitally, with the newsletter 'GRIT' now being free on the website to save printing costs. The SHHA website also provides classified ads, safety vests for purchase, and a community bulletin board with details on local events, and an opening for a new member in the Sandia Heights Book Club.
