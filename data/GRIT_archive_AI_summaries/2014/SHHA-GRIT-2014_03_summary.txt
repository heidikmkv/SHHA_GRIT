The SHHA Easter Egg Hunt is scheduled for April 19, 2014, at WL Jackson Park from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm, featuring activities such as an age divided egg hunt, face painting, chalk art, and prize giveaways. However, only SHHA members will be permitted, whom must RSVP with personal details for security purposes. The association has also implemented an email alert system. Regarding local wildlife, residents have been urged to bear proof their properties due to increased bear movement following the dry winter. Detailed advice is due in the April GRIT newsletter. Despite ongoing community challenges, the SHHA maintained steady progress and growth throughout 2013, with a successful turnout at various events and maintenance of community safety and aesthetics. An increase in member benefits, like local merchant discounts, and tram pass usage were also noted. The year also saw the Covenant Support Committee handle member reported issues like inappropriate vehicle parking and property maintenance. In addition, SHHA continued providing key services such as water, sewage, and security. Residents were warned against scams involving unsolicited roof check offers, with Sandia Heights Security offering vigilant oversight. GRIT magazine also held information about neighborhood based home enhancement projects and other community announcements, with further details on the SHHA website. In light of preserving road safety, residents were asked to follow basic walking precautions and construction safety measures. SH resident, Peter Marks volunteered his services for SHIP, assisting people in navigating the healthcare system free of charge. For artists in Sandia Heights, a studio tour was announced for September 6 & 7, 2014. Members were also encouraged to submit photos for the residence directory of the next year.
