Acclaimed Nashville based singer, Carolyn Martin, will perform in a concert organized by the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series at the Church of the Good Shepherd at 7:30 p.m. on September 13. Her band will perform various original work, western swing classics, songs from the swing era, Broadway and Hollywood show tunes, and traditional country music. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA) is looking for board members and members to join the Covenant Support Committee (CSC), due to a decrease in members and anticipated delayed investigations into suspected covenant violations. Eligible residents should consider volunteering and can reach out to the SHHA office to sign up. SHHA members avail discounts at local participating merchants and free, access to an online GRIT newsletter, as well as a directory guide. They've recently approved the Hawks Landing Development Plan, which was later appealed, and initiated a campaign promoting cleaning up after pets. Advice on tree care is also provided as part of the membership but does not cover services under Sandia Heights Services. Residents are reminded to secure homes against burglaries and engage actively in community safety efforts. They're also advised on maintaining trees and arroyos on their properties, while adhering to community covenants, notably regarding parking and storage rules. SHHA office provides a range of services from notary to tram passes, and is open from Monday to Friday. Moreover, a photo contest is open for the annual 2015 Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide and residents can submit their original photographs for consideration.
