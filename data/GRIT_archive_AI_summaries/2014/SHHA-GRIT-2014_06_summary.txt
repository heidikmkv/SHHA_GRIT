Ann Zimmerman, the President of SHHA, will resign on May 23, 2014, due to a health issue and a move to Whidbey Island in Washington. She previously held various roles within the organization, including community service committee member and Membership chairperson. A new President will be elected in June. As of June 1st, SHHA has ceased its free tram pass service, which was previously eight corporate passes per day. Now, each pass will cost $5, with no allowances for deposits, refunds, or cancellations. As a response to the ongoing drought and increased fire risk, the Bernalillo County Commission imposed fire restrictions on March 25, 2014, lasting for 180 days. The SHHA had a successful Easter Egg Hunt, enjoyed by members and attendees despite weather conditions. Property owners can pass on SHHA membership dues to their tenants via utility bills. This grants renters access to membership benefits, barring voting rights and file covenant violation complaints ability. More volunteers are needed in the Covenant Support Committee to investigate covenant violations quickly to maintain property value. George Connor of the Parks and Safety Committee provides cycling safety tips for bikers and motorists, while Sandia Heights Services offers security suggestions like securing all entry points to houses to reduce burglaries. The Parks & Safety Committee urges homeowners to cut back thick vegetation near driveways to improve visibility, and issues related to such should be reported to SHHA office. They also focus on combating light pollution to preserve night sky visibility. There is a new Little Free Library at 1606 Quailwood Drive, and multiple home improvement projects have been approved and detailed on the SHHA website.
