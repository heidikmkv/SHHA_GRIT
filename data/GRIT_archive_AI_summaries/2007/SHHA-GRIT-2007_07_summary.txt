In July 2007, the SHHA released its update, highlighting the following points: The SHHA Board of Directors (BOD) re elected Marsha Thole and Bill McCall and introduced six new directors. Existing committees, such as the Community Service & Membership Committee (CS&M), Architectural Control Committee (ACC), and Communications & Publications Committee, are seeking new volunteers. Various community concerns about community rules enforcement, emergency response times, rezoning areas, and traffic issues were expressed. The results of the 2006 financial audit were a clean bill of health and some procedural recommendations. The organization's cash flow is positive, with a total of $1,411.62. Upcoming events include the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert featuring Tim Grimm, the annual photo contest, and numerous activities for the singles group, SOSH. The SHHA office is at 2 B San Rafael, Albuquerque, NM 87122, staffed by Lena Martinez and Sheraz Saint LÃ´t. The Executive Committee comprises President Sy Caudill, Vice President Ed Tull, Secretary William McCall, and Treasurer Ed Whitten along with several other board members. The Sandia Heights Security Patrol, as well as the Architectural Control Committee, reported on their recent activities, including various community patrols and approved home improvement projects. Homeowner related projects ranged from roof replacements, stucco refinishing, to updating privacy elements. For instance, at 1913 Quail Run Drive, numerous improvements were approved, with the exception of the Ponderosa pine due to possible obstruction of views. SOSH is planning a variety of events, including a backstage tour at the Opera, Chile supper, and concert at Lensic Theater. There's a conflict of interest regarding a proposed T Mobile cell tower. While better connectivity is desired, many are concerned about the obstruction of views. Further information and resources are available on the SHHA website at www.sandiahomeowners.org. The statement ends with wishes for a safe Fourth of July holiday and postage information.
