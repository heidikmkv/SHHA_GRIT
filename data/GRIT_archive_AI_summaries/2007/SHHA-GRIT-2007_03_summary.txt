The SHHA has announced several important updates: A zoning change request for the property at Tramway Blvd and Paseo Del Norte is to be revised to a Special Use Permit (SUP) for a planned residential development of 70 residences. No apartments will be built, the natural arroyo will be preserved, and any infrastructures will adhere to the 26' height restriction. SHHA seeks new volunteer directors for the 2007 board. Directors serve three year terms, starting from the election time. They communicate regular meeting times and sudden changes via email and phone lists for residents to get in touch. The current leadership includes President Dick Cline, Vice President Ed Tull, Secretary William McCall, and Treasurer Ed Whitten among other board members. Their office staff includes Lena Martinez (ACC Administrative Assistant) and Sheraz Saint LÃ´t (Publications & Communications Editor). Residents can reach them through calls, emails, or visits to the office located at 2 B San Rafael, Albuquerque, NM 87122 during office hours (Monday to Friday, 9 am till 3 pm). Their editorial policy maintains a balance of opinions in issues, filters out abusive or unsigned submissions from their publications, and encourages community engagement with security and architectural updates. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC), which enables access to the project log on the SHHA website, has approved several construction projects throughout the community. To uphold architectural standards and enhance property value, residents are asked to support the ACC through membership, financial contributions, or volunteer work. Resident Alyson Clark stresses the importance of backing the Covenant Support Committee (CSC), urging residents to notify of any negligence of neighborhood agreements. Park Status updates include the addition of benches, a bike rack, and picnic tables. The Bylaws Committee is on the lookout for two volunteers to help maintain community standards and regulations. Lastly, a recycling event is scheduled, with the exception of glass recycling. For those willing to volunteer during this event, they should contact Cheryl Ferguson by phone (505 856 1403) or email (cheryl@nmpolicymatters.com).
