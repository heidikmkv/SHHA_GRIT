The SHHA serves the community by handling various needs like permit acquisition, road safety, park, and land use while safeguarding community standards. It recently reached a solution that allows an office building but with less broad uses to occur in a case of rezoning, but suffered a loss in August with an inflow of $13,619.85 and an outflow of $22,464.30. Among other initiatives, SHHA seeks public funding to acquire a 10.3 acre parcel of undeveloped land for future preservation, is drafting revisions to board term limitations, and encourages community input in decision making processes. Efforts are also being made to coordinate road maintenance with refuse pick ups and repair curb damages. Most architectural applications obtained approval, with exceptions including an incomplete application for a wall at 1476 Morning Glory Road, disapproval of an non compliant project at 403 Live Oak Loop, and a landscape project at 1223 Rockrose Road. The organization also cautioned residents against illegal modifications like the replaced fence at 2717 Tramway Circle. Feedback on the board's term of office and election process can be submitted until October 8. Additionally, SHHA is hosting a photo contest for the 2008 Resident Directory, with a submission deadline of November 15. It also hosts the Singles Of Sandia Heights (SOSH), planning multiple fall activities, and has a community event at the State Fairgrounds. In other news, Bob Francis announced the blooming of Aster plants in the area and recommended the cutting of the Brickle Bush before it seeded. Finally, SHHA reiterated the need for safety during Halloween and announced a Board Meeting on October 10 at 7 p.m.
