Post the annual meeting, the SHHA and Board of Directors are actively engaged in various community projects, as highlighted by President Sy Caudill. This includes the contribution of the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) and the Covenant Support Committee (CSC), maintaining the unique character of the community through clear communication and stringent adherence to covenants. The SHHA is also efficient at managing these projects despite a reduced number of board members. Key upcoming community events and activities include the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series featuring Tim Grimm, the 4th Annual Studio Tour spotlighting local artists and the Grand Opening of the Rio Grande Ace Hardware store under new administration. There's impressive participation in the Sandia Heights social club, SOSH, showcasing diverse member demographics. The association's financial status as of July 2007 reflects a healthy cash inflow. The executive committee is directed by President Dick Cline, Vice President Ed Tull, Secretary William McCall, and Treasurer Ed Whitten, aided by twelve board members and dedicated office staff Lena Martinez and Sheraz Saint LÃ´t. Communication guidelines exist for the platform, GRIT, with anonymity discouraged and constructive criticism encouraged. For security, optimal parking is suggested in the garage; July's data reports 442 security related calls. The ACC has been busy with numerous approvals and reviews pertaining to home reparations and modifications. Regrettably, there have been disturbing incidents involving irresponsible cycling and an outbreak of Rabbit Fever, causing a high population of rabbit deaths. SHHA residents are asked to adhere to traffic rules and be mindful of the ongoing disease. Upcoming dates to remember include the SHHA Office closing in observance of Labor Day on September 3rd, the SHHA Board meeting on September 12th and free notary services for active members. Lastly, to stay informed, residents are lovingly urged to frequently visit the constantly updated SHHA website.
