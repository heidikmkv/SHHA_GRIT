The SHHA works with Sandia Heights Services to provide essential utilities and services, including offering security checks and maintaining community character, financed by monthly residents' dues of $20. An optional $32 fee grants access to the community pool. The Association stresses respect for private property rights, particularly regarding the shared but privately owned arroyos, and illegal use of these is punishable under New Mexico law. SHHA members now have exclusive benefits including free access to the world's longest aerial tramway and Sandia Heights Coffeehouse concert series, opportunities made possible by the GRIT committee. Officers and board members, headed by President Sy Caudill, aim to uphold community safety, collectively with the residents, by encouraging reporting of any suspicious activities. The Sandia Heights Security receives numerous calls, particularly from vacationing homeowners, and any queries regarding these can be addressed to them directly. Updates include an upcoming performance by Nashville folk country singer/songwriter James Talley as part of the Coffeehouse Concert Series. In terms of real estate activities, the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) approves most home improvement projects, but reminds residents to refer to the ACC Project Log and guidelines to avoid missteps like the unauthorized ones occurred at 795 E Tramway Lane and 1038 Tramway Lane. They strongly advise homeowners to consider tree and plant species and appropriate placement to protect the community's unique mountain and valley views. The Singles of Sandia Heights (SOSH) group invites new members to join shared drives to events and activities. Other planned events and activities include a residents' photo contest, a vendor night at the Church of the Good Shepherd Preschool, and Sandia Heights Wildflower Club meetings. The winning photo from the contest will be featured on the 2008 resident directory cover.
