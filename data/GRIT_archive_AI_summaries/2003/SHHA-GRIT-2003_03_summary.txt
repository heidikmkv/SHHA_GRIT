After lengthy deliberations, the SHHA board has approved new regulations due for ratification at the annual meeting set for June 7, 2003. Along with the adoption of new regulations, the annual meeting will also serve as a platform for electing new board members, discussing the future of Cedar Hill Park, and deliberating potential impacts of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County's proposed unification on Sandia Heights. The board also emphasized the role of the Traffic & Safety Committee in ensuring residents' safety, despite criticism over the use of speed humps as traffic calming measures. The Architectural Control Committee will continue reviewing plans of new construction and renovation projects within Sandia Heights for alignment with the neighborhood's restrictive covenants. The revised bylaws aim to make roles and responsibilities clearer and enhance the efficiency of standing committees. Despite underrepresentation from four districts on the SHHA board, the administration effectively manages the interests of all homeowners and property owners, though efforts are underway to recruit candidates from unrepresented districts. Plans are underway to revise the Restrictive Covenants across the community, which will require a 75% approval of property owners in each unit. The text also outlines the history of Sandia Heights, a community developed since 1965. The SHHA, founded in 1972, was formally incorporated as a non profit in New Mexico in 1975, seeking to promote the shared interests of the homeowners, property owners, and residents in the Sandia Heights Development. The association grew in tandem with the Tram Company and its subsidiaries and took on greater financial responsibility by 1985 to offer services like covenant monitoring and enforcement. Meanwhile, issues such as noise disturbances, remodeling endeavors, and community events within Sandia Heights have been addressed, and a neighborhood questionnaire is to be released. Lastly, residents can enjoy natural landscaping and participate in local clubs and events to enhance the community's livability. On a different note, the text concludes with seasonal gardening tips, including pruning schedules and planting recommendations for Albuquerque residents. April and May are perfect times for fertilizing, planting, and landscape improvement activities, and residents are encouraged to get involved.
