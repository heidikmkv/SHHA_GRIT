The accounting records of SHIA from June 2001 to October 2002 were audited with modifications made to improve our accounting system. Non board members Ben Bonner and Dan Benton affirmed that our records and accounting practices are in line with standard practices. Los Arboles Tree Service, unlicensed and misusing tree sprays, has been given a warning by the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, cautioning against their use. The 2004 SHIA photo contest for a chance to feature on the Residence Directory cover is announced, with a reminder that our ads are not endorsements, and can be halted should there be complaints against an advertiser. The traffic issue of excessive speeding in SH is also raised, with the enforced speed limit of 15 mph scrutinized due to lack of law enforcement and belief of some residents that the previous limit was 25 mph. The speed study done in May 2002 found nearly 500 cars daily with many excessing the limit. Residents are encouraged to drive respectfully, pointing out that a possible speed limit increase to 25 mph would only save around 19.2 seconds, urging to weigh it against potential dangers.
