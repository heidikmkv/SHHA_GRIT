Jack Wolfe's contribution to the SHHA Board of Directors, marked by his quest for better clarity and procedural efficiency, is deeply missed. Concerns about the growing disregard for local guidelines in Sandia Heights community, including unauthorized construction projects, visible material storage, and inappropriate parking, need to be addressed urgently to preserve the area's unique character. Residents are suggested to periodically review Unit Covenants, interact with neighbors about concerns, and report any violations to the Covenant Support Committee (CSC). SHHA is gearing up for an audit of the previous year's accounting records and is seeking volunteers with relevant experience. It is essential for residents to adhere to their annual membership fees obligation for the community's sustenance. There are several available services in the community, including plumbing, heating, cooling, tax law, estate law, business law, jewelry repair, landscape design, and home services provided by various local businesses. Potential community changes like enhancing commercial presence along Tramway Blvd, altering residential lawns during persistent drought, and a proposed regional Water Control Board could have a lasting impact on Sandia Heights and the City/County Unification. Issues such as the potential use of Cedar Hill Park and demands from property owners to build walls around their lots are also prevalent. The benefits of recirculating air conditioning systems equipped with electrostatic filters for allergy sufferers, its electricity efficiency, and the cost saving advantage of reusable filters have been highlighted. A common installation error of replacing a swamp cooler with an air conditioner and adding a single return duct is addressed. The differing functioning mechanism of both systems needs separate treatment. For dual swamp cooler houses, the suggestion of installing a high capacity air conditioner at one and using the other as a return duct system is proposed. The importance of strategic airflow and preventing potential mold formation due to condensation from cool ducts is underscored. Professional advice is recommended for addressing uncertainties during conversion.
