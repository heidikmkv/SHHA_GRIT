Throughout the past year, the SHIA Board of Directors realized a number of achievements: Implemented a dues increase for improved future funding. Unanimously approved new by laws. Participated in the Sandia Pueblo settlement. Made substantial contribution towards Cedar Hill Park's development. Conducted a resident survey and attended CityCounty Unification Charter Commission meetings. Smoothly transitioned roles from old to new officers. Welcomed five new board members and reelected three SHHA Board members. Suggestions for discounted local business services for SHHA members were initiated by the Service & Membership Committee while the Covenant Support Committee addressed several covenant violations. Communications & Publications, led by Rick Nelson, garnered a surplus from advertisement revenue. Cedar Hill Park was a primary focus, with productive planning meetings and generous financial and design contributions leading to construction commencement. Despite budget limitations, other smaller scale activities were also completed. The year's financial report revealed total earnings of $137,297.26 against expenditures of $144,707.93. Concurrently, the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) approved 144 projects while ensuring these remained compliant with established covenants. The ACC developed internal guidelines to guarantee consistent and fair decisions regarding construction and renovation projects. They emphasized covenant conformance, including for unclear restrictions, and encouraged homeowner involvement in their meetings. A particular attention area was the rising wall/fence construction applications. Finally, the Traffic, Safety, and Environment Committee focussed on environment preservation and safety initiatives. These included measures to control dog waste, prevent accelerated erosion, manage community street safety and upkeep roadside appearance through vegetation management. The committee's uncertain investigation into Sandia Heights to National Forest access legality signals a need for user respect and propriety. Any parties interested in natural gas services were advised to contact SHEA's office. The board ends its report with well wishes for the 4th of July and noting the payment of presorted standard U.S. postage, with permit #375 in Albuquerque.
