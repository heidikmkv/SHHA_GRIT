Sandia Heights emphasizes compliance with covenants for detached structures on residential lots concerning their size, aesthetic, and location. The size should not exceed 20% of the primary residence, should blend in with the primary house's style to avoid reducing property values, and should adhere to setback provisions. A financial report for August 2003 was given by Cheryl Iverson showing total cash of $49,080.88 and total assets of $63,777.88 with liabilities of $24,028.50. The possible unification of Albuquerque and Beralillo County sparked a debate on potential tax base expansion and loss of residents' operational control influence over the unified governance. Homeowner association communities have increased 21% since 1998 in the U.S, offering cities and counties benefits, but also fostering conflicts necessitating third party or court resolution. In Sandia Heights community, the introduction of discounts on membership cards and organizing events like concerts are enhancing the community feeling. However, potential issues such as accidents involving cars and bikes, blocked views due to excessive vegetation, and damage to pine trees due to beetles have emerged. These could be controlled by obeying speed limits, maintaining property vegetation, and removing affected trees. The SHHA has evolved to handle these responsibilities, including covenant enforcement. They now have an office, a website, have developed various public areas, and have established procedures for recruitment and dismissal of staff. Hearings have been raised regarding speeding by local teenagers and increasing security measures. Consequently, membership and active participation in the SHHA are encouraged. The benefits of switching to refrigerated air conditioners are highlighted alongside their potential rise in operating costs. A public announcement was made for the third annual Holiday Lights featuring affordable electric luminaria sets available for purchase. There is a detailed gardening schedule for October and November to prepare gardens for fall and the upcoming 2021 planting season. Various events are also described such as, the Sandia Mountain field trip in August and residents are encouraged to partake in these community building endeavors.
