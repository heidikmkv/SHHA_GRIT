The SHHA held its annual meeting in summer 2000, addressing an array of topics: Discussing water landscape themes. Casting information for Judge Reed S. Sheppard. Revealing outcomes from a special session. Sharing tips to prevent tantrums. Announcing the new Sandia Heights bank. In addition to these, attendees were provided with information about Desert State Bank and numerous advertisements for local businesses such as cleaning services and pool construction. Local politician Tim Cummins made an appearance to endorse a more responsive, less intrusive government, proud Republican values, and highlight neighborhood needs. Attendees were also updated about the upcoming changes to the SHHA 2000/01 Directory of Residents and the summer outreach program. Advice on home remodeling and stress busting was disseminated, alongside advertisements from local businesses like a roofing company and a swimming instruction facility. The event concluded by introducing Sharon and Judson McCollumâ€”top performing agents in the area, along with the distribution of information about vacation opportunities, local events, and homeowner tips.
