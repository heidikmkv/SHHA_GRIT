Barbara Seward, outgoing County Commissioner praised by the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, has made notable contributions to the area in sectors like transportation, public safety, and land use during her eight year tenure. A large commercial development proposal in Sandia Heights was withdrawn due to the mobilization of the homeowners association and residents, who objected to the large retail space and limited residential properties in the proposed plan. The community, including artist residents and board members like Finian Murphy, is passionate about preserving the natural beauty and tranquility of Sandia Heights. The SHHA is active in communication with residents and is involved in numerous initiatives such as: Inviting residents to gardening meetings, featuring experts for landscape advice. Allocating a $60,000 reserve budget split into three reserves for operations, legal matters, and open space. Maintenance and update of the SHHA website, announcing board vacancies & organizing litter cleanup events. Regular community events, including the annual Membership Meeting and the Holiday Open House, at the newly established SHHA office. Launching a membership drive and seeking residents' photos for a new office gallery. Addressing existing concerns such as abandoned vehicles and potential discussions on access to Forest Service Lands and Trails in Sandia Heights. A nostalgic piece also describes a resident's connection with a local tree, igniting memories from their past and reinforcing how Sandia Heights' natural appeal contributes to residents' attachment to the community.
