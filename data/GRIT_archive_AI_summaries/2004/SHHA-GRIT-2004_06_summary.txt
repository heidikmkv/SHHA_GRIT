During his tenure as President of SHHA, Bob Francis prioritized legal activities, including enforcing community covenants and addressing the unsuccessful County Unification proposal. The SHHA board recently developed new by laws, committee charters, and orientation sessions for incoming board members to improve their understanding of the association's legal implications. SHHAalso held their annual meeting recently where they appointed new board members and officers, and necessary financial updates were also presented. Some key figures include a total receipt of $178,547.55 and disbursements totaling $141,123.03. The Association reported a profit from fundraising events but saw an increase in insurance costs. Several committees made significant updates during the meeting. The Traffic and Safety Committee reported speed hump challenges and issues with Fire Marshal communication; the Architectural Control Committee discussed the concept of "Harmony" which encourages constructions to blend with natural surroundings. Meanwhile, the Financial Committee welcomed new Sandia Heights community members. The Association also announced some community events and updates, such as extended office hours, commencement of construction at W.L. Jackson Park, and an annual brainstorming meeting. Additionally, several local services are available in the area, such as pet sitting, babysitting, house sitting, and social event planning. The community has also continued work in the Communications and Publications Department and Community Service & Membership, which involve improving publications, websites and increasing memberships. The Special Liaison Committee reported commercial development discussions related to properties owned by Futures for Children, the Outpost, and a land at the northeast corner of Tramway and San Rafael. Efforts are continually being made to exercise control over development projects. As for future plans, a proposal for an internet based forum for property owners to debate significant issues was made two years ago. The project is finally making progress, and volunteers for beta testing are being recruited. The full implementation of this forum will be decided by the SHHA BOD after adequate testing.
