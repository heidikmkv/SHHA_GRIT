The SHHA is requesting nominations for new board director positions, with elected directors expected to serve three year terms, and make a weekly commitment of 4 6 hours. Board members should also attend monthly meetings and participate in at least one standing committee. Additionally, SHHA has secured a contract with Lawnshapers of Albuquerque for the removal of dead or dying pinons on residents' properties. Although financial reports reflect some hit on expenses, the association has increased voluntary membership by 67%. Sharon Chapa expressed her concern over the leaks from the radiant floor heating system in her home, and SHHA stressed the new rules that require motor homes and boats to be enclosed in garages. Philip Ciofalo raised an ongoing issue with a low pitched humming noise in his home, encouraging residents to support a petition for further investigations. The Covenant Review Group is finalizing unified covenants, while efforts are being made to preserve the pinons and Ponderosa Pines. Residents are also invited to join the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club, and Dan Caudillo shared a series of gardening tasks for February in his "Gardener's Calendar". The tasks are split into early, mid, and end of the month, covering all aspects of seasonal gardening including seed preparation, tree pruning and bed preparation.
