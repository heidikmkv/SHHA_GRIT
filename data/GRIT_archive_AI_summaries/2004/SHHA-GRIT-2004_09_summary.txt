During the September 2004 Board Meetings, the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association deliberated and approved necessary modifications to the Bylaws. Adjustments include the protocol for electing directors, business transaction agendas, handling director resignations, and changes to committees' functioning. These changes will be discussed in a membership meeting on October 16th. Updates were given on the prevalent flat roof problems in Sandia Heights. Current codes dictate a small slope for efficient drainage, and homeowners are advised to fix the issue through professionals if necessary. Progress of the W.L. Jackson Park construction was shared with an estimated completion in September. The selected artwork, "Lizards," is set to be installed thanks to the Akerson Family Foundation. September 8 meeting shared various updates, including new office hours, contractor evaluations, and the availability of a notary public in the office. Frank Soper's Covenant Support Committee discussed creating Unified Covenants (UCs), trending towards less ambiguous covenants to aid property values. Despite challenges in amending the covenants, they're undergoing legal review and resident critique. Community issues highlighted include reckless driving, tall trees blocking views, and insufficient community spirit among Sandia Heights residents. For traffic calming, "chokers" will be installed on San Rafael street. Several classified ads and important information, including trash pick up timings, were provided, ending with the address of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association.
