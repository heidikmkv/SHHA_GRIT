The SHHA will conduct its Annual Wine Tasting event on April 24th, between 4 7pm at Futures for Children, featuring global wines, live music, a silent auction, and socializing. All proceeds will go to Futures for Children, and attendees need to reserve seats as organized ticket sales will be absent. The SHHA is also requesting silent auction donations and volunteers for different roles. The SHHA has called for new board members to take over from retiring directors for three year term positions, where they will take part in committees and attend monthly board meetings. The emphasis is on community representation in this changeover phase. Concerns have been raised about neighborhood commercial developments, particularly the planned Eckerd building and proposed Albuquerque Kwik Lube building, with accusations of insufficient community and county official consultation. Don Wortman, Chair of the Special Liaison Committee, has suggested boycotting Eckerds. The SHHA is revising its record of covenant amendments for all units, with Frank Soper, Chair of the Covenant Support Committee (CSC), emphasizing the need for residents to check their units' covenants. Mark Boslough highlighted the issue of traffic and safety, mentioning the setting up of stop signs due to limited visibility at certain intersections, and he welcomes input about other potentially hazardous junctions. Despite efforts, the proposal of speed humps on San Rafael Ave was vetoed by the Bernalillo County Fire Department. Letters to the editor have expressed worries about road walking and doubts about the utility of speed humps, while another letter suggests a self assessment for authority figures, examining their motivations and possible consequences.
