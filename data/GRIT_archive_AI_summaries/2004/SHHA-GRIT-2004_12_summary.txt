The SHHA invites members to a Holiday Party on December 8th for appreciation and board member discussions, particularly stressing the need for a Vice President. A design contest for subdivision entrance signs and a treasurer's report were shared. Recent events include a Halloween party, installations at W. L. Jackson Park, and a plan for an April 2005 Lizard artwork installation. Ep Turf Hill Park is promoted for various leisure activities while safety tips for the holiday season were put forth by Sandia Heights Security. A land use attorney reviewed the Unified Covenants, a photo contest with a winning photo featuring on the 2005 Directory was held, and initiatives like the ArtsView and Wildflower Club were spotlighted for community engagement. SHHA Board seeks suggestions from members and encourages them to use a project log for neighborhood query. A new ACC fee schedule effective from January 1, 2005, lowers rates for constructions, remodels and other changes to property, with unit specific adjustments, and exemptions for certain property updates. Varied fees apply to different commercial projects managed by SHHA, ranging from $40 (Variance Request) to covenant based rates (for Commercial Building and Multi Family Construction). Finally, a holiday greeting was issued by the SHHA office and a Presorted Standard U.S. postage fee has been paid with permit #375 in Albuquerque, NM.
