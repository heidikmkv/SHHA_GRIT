The SHHA is preparing for its upcoming annual wine tasting event, and residents of drinking age are invited to RSVP. The event will include a silent auction, with participants encouraged to donate auction items. The SHHA is currently accepting reservations for the event and reviewing auction items at their office. In response to resident concerns, Eckerd Drugs has made design and lighting modifications to their new store in accordance with SHHA guidelines. In addition, the SHHA office will be extending its hours for the summer for residents to discuss any community concerns. Current assets of the association stand at $842,637.12, and liabilities at $42,042.31, leaving a net balance of $27,525.79. SHHA is encouraging resident membership on the board and urges interested parties to review board committee descriptions in the 2003 Residents Directory. Applications should be submitted to the SHHA office or Nominations Committee. The SHHA has been actively monitoring local construction projects for alignment with community aesthetics and values. The association continues its year long effort to standardize unit specific covenants into a unified document. The aim is to ensure architectural harmony, clarify SHHA expectations, and enhance property value. A list of Red Cross certified, referred babysitting and house sitting services are available. Adjustments have been made to the Eckard building's height and color scheme in response to SHHA feedback. A successful discussion between the Special Liaison Committee and George Burnell has resulted in changes to the Albuquerque Kwik Lube development plans. Any future concerns regarding the Eckerd building should be directed to Jim Ross. Residents are warned about a recent trend of local muggings, and are advised to remain vigilant. Differing resident perspectives on speed bump installation and zoning laws were shared. The newsletter includes Ruth Friesen's support of Eckerd's design efforts and her plea for a more reasoned approach from the board, along with Dan Caudillo's Garden Calendar outlining gardening activities for May.
