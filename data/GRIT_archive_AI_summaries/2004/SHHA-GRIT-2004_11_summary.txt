The SHHA is hosting its annual photo contest for the 2005 Sandia Heights Resident Directory, with a deadline for submissions by November 19th. The Town Hall meeting on October 17th had low member attendance, delaying the vote on Bylaws, but newly appointed board member, Vicki Criel gave an impressive talk. Over 70 complaints about new traffic chokers on San Rafael were received, and these will be reassessed after a 90 day period. The Treasurer's Report showed that as of September 2004, cash in banks was at $77,668.30 and total assets were $93,444.63. The Arts View event led to potential for new event plans, like "music under the stars". Members are reminded to regularly check the SHHA website for updates and adhere to trash pick up rules. Office hours are 9 am 3 pm, Monday through Friday, and a notary public is available by appointment. The Bernalillo County Public Works Operations and Maintenance Department stresses property owners' responsibility for the "setback" area maintenance and warns against illegal waste disposal. Community services available include housekeeping, babysitting, pet care, and more. A used 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 4x4 is for sale. Lastly, SHHA is checking the contact information of residents for the upcoming 2005 directory and requests for information updates can be made at 797 7793 or via email at shha@sandiahomeowners.org.
