The SHHA won a lawsuit against a homeowner who unlawfully constructed a garage extension despite the Architectural Control Committee's denial of the request. The SHHA's treasurer, Cheryl Iverson, reported total assets of $98,679.88 in July 2004 after liabilities, and a net cash amount of $50,718.53 in the bank. The SHHA also runs a member newsletter, The GRIT, and announced an art committee's formation. They will host ArtsView, showcasing artists' work, and the East Mountain Artist Series, a non profit organization, will begin its concert season. Reports of speeding in the area prompted residents to contact law enforcement for safety. SHHA cautioned homeowners against certain materials when re stuccoing residences and extended office hours. They also successfully conducted local activities like the Annual Garden Walk and The Wildflower Club's field trip and potluck supper. SHHA board met with Bernalillo county officials to address speeding issues and presented installing "chokers" to slow down traffic. At the June annual meeting, homeowners aired concerns about traffic, safety, signage, fire protection, and dog related issues. Proposed changes aim to empower the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) to act independently of homeowners filing complaints. Changes in the community outlet, the Grit, include better proofreading and allowing constructive controversy. Miscellaneous issues include early trash disposal, a potential community center, and a possible gourmet group. Albuquerque Kwik Lube encouraged the use of their maintenance services.
