The SHHA, headed by President Roger Hagengruber, operates on San Rafael Avenue, Albuquerque, NM from 9 AM to 4 PM. Upcoming events include the Albuquerque School Board election featuring candidates Nicholas Bevins, Julie Brenning, and Courtney Jackson, and Zoom webinars organized by the Community Service & Membership Committee. Historical contexts from the area include the life histories of Domingo Baca and Josefa Baca, notable individuals with significant influences in New Mexico. However, Sandia Heights faces recurring violations against community guidelines, prompting the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to allocate legal status and penalties for violations. Additionally, the SHHA has established protocols for proposing amendments to unit covenants and provides emergency, utility, and other contact information. SHHA also provides office hours updates, board meeting schedules, various member benefits, and notices. It calls attention to the ecological balance, cautioning against invasive plant species that can disrupt the local environment and reminding homeowners to manage plant growth. Several invasive species have been identified in the area, including Scotch thistles and tumbleweeds, which homeowners are encouraged to control. Likewise, community enhancement activities like construction projects require ACC's approval. Residents have the opportunity to join community dinner programs and the annual photo contest for the 2022 Resident Guide & Directory. The SHHA also encourages homeowners to review their directory entries and send in updates for the 2022 edition. Home weather management tips include manipulating window shades relative to the sun's position. The SHHA office will observe Indigenous Peoples' Day on October 11, 2021, and therefore will not open.
