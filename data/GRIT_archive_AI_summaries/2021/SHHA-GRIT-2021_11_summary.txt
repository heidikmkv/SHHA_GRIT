The SHHA is an active community organization, conducted under the leadership of President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp along with several dedicated board members including Bob Thomas and Susan McCasland, who also lead various committees. The SHHA is currently inviting applications for the Board of Directors, with successful candidates due to begin serving right after the Annual Meeting in February. Interested parties can access these applications via the SHHA website. The SHHA is eager to acquire community feedback regarding invasive tree species in Sandia Heights, particularly the Siberian Elm. Property owners are recommended to consider applying herbicides, like Garlon 4 or Triclopyr4, to contain the issue. SHHA's Architectural Control Committee's (ACC) Formal Design Guidelines are now enforceable, and the details can be found on the SHHA website. Changes to the 2022 directory entries are accepted, and new residents need to verify their contact details with the SHHA offices. The SHHA also highlighted community events such as the Cork & Fork dining activity and an upcoming photo competition. The association is not affiliated with Sandia Heights Security, and contact details can be found in the monthly report. Notable landmarks in the community include The Church of the Good Shepherd, which has been serving since 1985, and the local high school, La Cueva, named in honor of the 10th Duke of Alburquerque, Francisco Fern√°ndez de la Cueva. Lastly, SHHA will host a semi annual trash pickup on November 6, and the office will remain closed on November 11 for Veterans' Day and November 25 & 26 for Thanksgiving.
