The SHHA comprises officers President Woody Farber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Travis Rich, and Treasurer Cheryl Iverson; board members including Dale Arendt and Bob Bower, among others; and committee chairs like Bob Bower and Susan McCasland. These individuals operate from the SHHA office in Albuquerque, administrated by Betsy Rodriguez and Jennifer Craft. Upcoming SHHA events include the 2021 Annual Meeting, to be held virtually in February, with registration required by February 12. Meeting activities include introductions, officer reports, and a Q&A session. The SHHA also shares articles, like one from Kate Fry about the owls of Sandia Heights, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem and discourages using poison bait to control pests. Regarding SHHA's residential regulations, garbage cans must be stored out of public view and only put out between 5 PM the previous day and 7 AM on the pickup day. Memberships to SHHA and Sandia Heights Security offer a range of services, including security, water supply, and waste disposal. Available at the SHHA office are items for sale such as safety vests and tram passes; benefits for members also include discounts from various merchants. An important local landmark is the Kiwanis Cabin, constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, which provided a great contribution to conservation efforts during the Great Depression. The popular "Cork & Fork" dinner gatherings have unfortunately been cancelled due to the pandemic, but are expected to return in October 2021. Finally, the SHHA office is currently trialing extended opening hours, with a limit of two visitors at a time and strict mask wearing enforced due to COVID 19, although the office will be closed for Presidentsâ€™ Day, but members wanting to volunteer for the Community Service & Membership committee can contact the office.
