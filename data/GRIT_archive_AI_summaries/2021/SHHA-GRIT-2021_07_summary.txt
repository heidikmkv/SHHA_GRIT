The SHHA, led by President Roger Hagengruber and Vice President Susan McCasland, reminds residents to safely celebrate Independence Day, aiming to prevent wildfires. With an office at 12700 San Rafael Avenue NE, Ste. 3 in Albuquerque open Monday Friday, the SHHA Board oversees several committees including architectural control, covenant support, communications, and finance. A rise in requests for solar panel system installations noted by Bob Bower from the ACC encourages homeowners to factor in sun orientation and roof condition for efficient installation. The community in Unit 23 promotes communication and resident engagement through a Google Group, Neighborhood Watch program, Little Free Library, annual Memorial Day block party and a welcome procedure initiated by resident Roseann Houlihan 20 years ago The importance of community safety highlighted in recent Sandia Heights Security Patrol log and offerings of the SHHA Member Benefits Program, e.g., safety vests and tram passes, plus access to various service discounts. Further, there are restrictions on parking recreational vehicles such as boats and RVs to maintain aesthetics and property values. Notable community projects involve roof installations and restorations, with members like Ms. George showing exemplary community spirit by dedicating time to clear invasive tumbleweeds. The community calendar marks the Sandia Heights Art Tour for the weekend of September 25 26, but "Cork & Fork" Dining Activities continue to be on hold due to the pandemic. The deadline for the Sandia Heights 2022 Resident Guide & Directory's annual photo contest is November 5, 2021. The SHHA office will be closed on July 5th for Independence Day.
