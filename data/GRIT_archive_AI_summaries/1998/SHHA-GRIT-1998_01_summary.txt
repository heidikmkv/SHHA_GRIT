The Winter 1998 issue of The Grit magazine was not published separately due to an unforeseen delay with the Fall 1997 edition. This lag resulted in the Fall 1997 issue being printed a month late, effectively leading to a merger with the Winter 1998 issue. Consequently, the specific edition was designated as the Fall 1997/Winter 1998 issue.
