The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association is implementing a Light Ordinance to combat light pollution in Bernalillo County, with the help of recommendations from Zoning Administrator Frank Sandoval. Alongside this, they are awaiting a completion of a drainage plan for Cedar Hills Subdivision, preliminary approval for a day spa project, and arranging their annual meeting in June. Among the associationâ€™s other achievements, their Contractor Evaluation Program is frequently used and highly appreciated by residents. They have also commented on various state legislative developments, such as closing of drive up liquor stores, additional police officer funding and educational reforms. The state has also passed several bills concerning welfare reform, tax cuts, crime prevention, and highway improvements. Meanwhile, a special legislative session is in the works to rectify budgeting issues. Among their community events, a wine tasting event is scheduled for March 7th at the Futures For Children facility. Residents are concerned about the brightness of the lighting at the Kicks 66 Station on Tramway and the legality of real estate signs being placed at corners and intersections. The Association recommends residents to comply with all regulations during renovation and construction season. Pending decision on what constitutes an RV and disturbances over wire fences are issues being tackled. Regarding wildlife encounters, a collaborative project with Defenders of Wildlife has published a New Mexico Wildlife Viewing Guide.
