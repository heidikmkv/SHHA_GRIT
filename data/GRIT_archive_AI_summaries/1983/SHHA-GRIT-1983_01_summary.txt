The 1982 annual Homeowners' meeting of Sandia Heights convening on June 15 saw attendance from 31 members representing 25 families. Newly elected board members included Wendland Beezhold and John Miller, with Wendland succeeding Rab Freeman as President. Other board members comprised Bob Hoffer (Treasurer), Mary Ann Reed (Secretary), Anita Miller, Stan Bazant, John Miller, and Bob Murphy. The next meeting's agenda, set for February 26, 1983, included discussions on county planning for Tramway, Tram company development plans, and a liquor license for 'The County Lineâ€™ restaurant, among others. Members were provided with attachment containing data from Tram Company, liquor license hearing information, and zoning and rezoning data, alongside homeowners' financial statements. Additionally, the Sandia Peak Tram Company has planned zoning of land for residential use as per the 1976 Master Plan. Two areas west of Tramway Boulevard are being zoned for townhouses and garden homes, while a third at the southeast corner of Sandia Heights is designated for residential lots, each about 3/4 acre in size, bearing restrictions similar to other Sandia Heights lots. The association continues monitoring for breaches of restriction covenants, and the area's guard service has extended weekend shifts due to recent incidents of vandalism. Lastly, information regarding hearings for the restaurant's liquor license was shared during the meeting.
