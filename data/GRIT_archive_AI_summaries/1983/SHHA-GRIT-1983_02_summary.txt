The Sandia Residential Association expresses gratitude to Sandia Heights residents for standing against the liquor license application by County Line of Albuquerque on Tramway Lane. Despite harsh weather, 130 residents attended a formal hearing on February 4, 1983, which resulted in the rejection of the license by County Hearing Officer, Mr. Tito Chavez. The consensus of the residents was that a bar or restaurant at that location could harm their safety and this argument was successfully presented by attorney Mr. McCullough. A reminder that all homeowners in Sandia Heights are voting members of the Association, even if not all pay voluntary dues, thus their presence can greatly shape the community. Hence, it is recommended that residents join the upcoming meeting of the Association on Saturday, February 26, 1983, at the Firehouse to contribute to discussions about Sandia Heights' future.
