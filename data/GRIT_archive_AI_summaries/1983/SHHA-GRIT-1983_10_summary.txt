In 1983, the Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association conducted a survey to gauge community attitudes towards the liquor license application of the County Line Restaurant. The initiative, led by Vice President Randall Williams, saw responses from 37% of the 692 residences, with 67% opposing the establishment and citing increased traffic hazards as a primary concern. Consequently, the Board decided to actively oppose the application, doubting the consistency between the proposed 140 seat lounge and the purported "family restaurant" image. The Homeowners' Board is also tightening control over covenant violations and homeowner information services, which were previously managed by the Tram Company. To this end, they are currently recruiting for an Executive Vice President and are tackling restriction violations such as unscreened boats, unauthorized building structures, and unscreened antenna discs. The board also rejected the Tram Company's proposed fee increases for various services and stressed the need for additional funds for neighborhood maintenance. Homeowners were reminded of restrictions, the requirement to pay dues, and the illegality of animal cruelty. The Association has planned numerous upcoming events and activities including the Annual Sandia Heights Holiday Fair. Babysitting services are available from local persons Camille at 293 7816 and Lisa at 294 0122. All information is provided with transparency and in good faith by the Association's president, Wendland Beezhold.
