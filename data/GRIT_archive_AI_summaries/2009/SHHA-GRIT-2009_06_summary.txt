The SHHA will hold its annual meeting on June 6, 2009, from 10 AM to 12:30 PM at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Attendees will have a chance to vote on proposed bylaw amendments, meet newly elected officers, listen to presentations, and participate in a town hall discussion. Current SHHA President is Andy Anderson, with Phyllis Moore, Marsha Thole, and Ed Tull serving as the vice president, secretary, and treasurer respectively. Outgoing president Sy Caudill highlighted the successful accomplishments done by the association, encouraged members to participate, and addressed some remaining challenges. The SHHA is actively inviting more residents to join and volunteer as board members. Some of the member's benefits include limited pool and tram passes, free concerts, and waived Architectural Control Committee fees. The addition of three new directors — Larry Desonier, Michelle Munson, and Dick Wavrik — brings the total to 15. The Sandia Heights Security Patrol urges residents to inform them when leaving town for vacation season. SHHA members will receive membership cards for quicker access to amenities and local shop discounts. A partnership with Four Seasons Club offers limited swimming pool passes for members over the summer. Bernalillo County now allows registration for emergency alerts via cellular or VoIP phone numbers. SHHA is also managing numerous renovation and improvement projects. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) Project Log on the SHHA website provides updates. The Bylaws Committee drafted new bylaw amendments. Community events include a Garden Tour, educational field trips, and the Annual Pot Luck Supper. The 6th Annual Artists Studio Tour by the Sandia Heights Artists (SHA) will take place on September 26 and 27, from 1 5pm. Interested artists can reach out to Bruce Childs, Lynda Burch, or Terry Matthews for details by June 10.
