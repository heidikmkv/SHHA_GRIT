The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's (SHHA) president, Sy Caudill, is urging residents to contribute their time and volunteer to maintain the community. Key needs are for volunteers to support the association, which relies on membership fees to keep costs minimal, and to clear overgrown and invasive non native trees that are causing issues within the community. Steps are being taken to address the tree problem, including inviting a professional arborist to a community event and exploring discounts for tree trimming and removal. The treasurer's report was shared, and the SHHA is selling safety vests to increase pedestrian safety and working to improve road visibility. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) handles complaints regarding view obstructions, inappropriate parking, invasive lighting, and pet mismanagement. They work with the ACC to resolve issues. Residents are reminded to follow covenants, including those related to parking recreational vehicles and managing outdoor lights. Dog owners are encouraged to maintain cleanliness and follow regulations or face informing the County Animal Control Department. The SHHA is also approving home improvement projects and hosting the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series, featuring Acoustic Eidolon. Resident participation is encouraged for pedestrian safety and an upcoming tribute event for women in the military. Resident Lief Isaacson is commended for his photo chosen for the 2009 directory cover. Non members are encouraged to join the SHHA to enjoy full benefits.
