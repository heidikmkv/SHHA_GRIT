The SHHA, presided over by Andy Anderson, prioritizes community safety this fall, recommending reflective vests for nighttime activities. Over summer, the SHHA offered benefits such as Tram and swim passes, organized community events, and encouraged member participation in committees like the Architectural Control Committee, all in an effort to maintain an engaging and pristine community. The SHHA has also established a recycling pilot program in partnership with Sandia Heights Services (SHS) set to start in November. The community has addressed road encroachment issues and urges vigilance for potential plague threats related to local wild life. As for community updates: The treasurer's report informs of an overall total cash flow of $2,023.53. Andy Anderson encourages resident participation in the Architectural Control Committee. A curbside recycling pilot has been launched by SHS and the CS&MC offering bi weekly collection of certain recycled goods (plastic, paper, cardboard, aluminum, and tin). Plans for future committee functions at the Lower Hall have been announced, please contact Linda Bolton for more information. Approved architectural modifications can be viewed on the SHHA website.
