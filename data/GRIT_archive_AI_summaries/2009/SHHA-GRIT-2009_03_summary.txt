In the March 2009 Sandia Heights Homeowners Association Newsletter, President Sy Caudill addressed the issue of stray animals in the community, using the example of a stray cat called Sally to underscore the importance of responsible pet ownership. He also celebrated the resilience of local wildlife. The Newsletter contained a financial report showing an inflow of $15,395.04 and an outflow of $24,578.87, and detailed the services provided to members, ending with an appeal for Sally's adoption. The newsletter highlighted the success story of musician Walt Michael and advertised an upcoming event featuring him. Furthermore, the Bylaws Committee called for amendments to be submitted by March 14, 2009. Photoshop images were used to illustrate a blocked mountain view and the Parks & Safety Committee discussed community safety with 150 reflective vests up for sale. Lastly, the newsletter had updates on two major events: a meet and greet organized by the SHHA, and a faith conversation at Sandia Presbyterian Church, while also reminding the residents about the daylight saving adjustments. Upcoming meetings for the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club were also mentioned.
