In December 2009, Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's (SHHA) president, Andy Anderson, highlighted the issue of break ins and burglaries in the community, urging residents to enhance their personal safety. Anderson suggested setting house alarms, using motion sensitive lights, displaying security signs, and maintaining communication with Sandia Heights Security and the Sheriff's office. To address the concern of obstructed views by trees, the Community Services & Membership Committee (CS&MC) introduced the SHHA Tree Removal Lottery, which allows residents to remove certain trees for free, albeit with rules and specifications, by applying and showing proof of removal. The winners, selected during the SHHA Annual Meeting in June 2010, would get up to $750 per tree for removal expenses. The Association discourages Siberian Elm planting and encourages residents' participation in initiatives such as the Tree Lottery. SHHA also provides email alerts about security, tram passes, notary services, annual classified ads, concert series access, and possibly discounted safety vests. Residents took note of reduced speeds on the San Rafael, with reminders to store car garages and inform neighbors about extended absences. The neighbourhood watch was superseded by Sandia Heights Security, with praises for their service over the past five years. In other community activities, Sharon and Judson McCollum were commended for their real estate work, and the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series featured Syd Masters & the Swing Riders. Sandia Heights Services also reminded residents about trash and recycling schedules. Several improvement projects, including fence works, driveway constructions, repair works, and solar panel installations, have been approved across various locations. Local businesses like JADE Enterprises offer remodeling services and cabinet refacing, while SILVERLINE Enterprises specialize in window replacement. Details about an economic stimulus campaign can be found on RenewalByAndersen.com. Other updates include event schedules at the Church of the Good Shepherd and opportunities to purchase local artwork. SHHA photo contest results are due for publishing on their website.
