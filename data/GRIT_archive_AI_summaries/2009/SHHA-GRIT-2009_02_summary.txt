The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association has introduced a service whereby elected representatives, including Commissioner Wiener, interact directly with community members. Commissioner Wiener plans to attend association meetings and deal with the issues of property tax, inmate recidivism, and animal welfare. The Association plans to increase vehicle speed enforcement and offers free services, regular meetings, and safety vests. It emphasizes the importance of member involvement, consensus, and open communication. Association activities continue to thrive due to the active participation of the community. The Sandia Heights community is recognized due to its close proximity to wildlife. The 2009 directories have been sent out with a cover photo by Lief Isaacson. Increased involvement from parents with young children and female members in the association's activities is encouraged. All broadcasts will be digital from February 17, affecting those with outdoor antenna systems. For road/street maintenance, including snow removal, residents are encouraged to contact the county. Upcoming community events include the Church of the Good Shepherd's "Calling Us Back" service for Ash Wednesday and the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club meeting. For any covenant related queries, homeowners can visit www.sandiahomeowners.org. The association seeks to preserve the unique character of the community and appeals for volunteer directors for 2009.
