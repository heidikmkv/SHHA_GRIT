The SHHA circulates a quarterly newsletter focusing on local interests such as zoning laws, developmental projects, and neighborhood improvements, along with publishing a free annual directory with residentsâ€™ information for member use. Corrections can be submitted to the SHHA office and a popular annual Spring Fling Picnic is organized by the Association, offering an array of food and activities for attendees.
