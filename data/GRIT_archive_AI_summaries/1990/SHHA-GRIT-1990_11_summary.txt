The County Planning Commission paused approval of a proposed 148 acre residential community, Primrose Pointe, due to issues with drainage, lack of parks, water and sewer line alignments, and financial responsibility for maintaining open spaces. S&S Associates, the project developer, is also waiting for approval of a Special Use Permit for higher housing density. Both North Albuquerque Acres and Sandia Heights residents expressed concerns about the project, prompting funding of a real estate consulting firm. Measures to address these concerns are included in a revised Master Plan. The SHHA plans further community engagement through recycling initiatives, the annual Holiday Lights Contest, and the formation of a Parks and Recreation Committee. SHHA also offers advertising services, a line of uniquely designed T shirts, fire safety reminders, and alarm system guidelines. The proposed Primrose Pointe continues to raise concerns relating to density, potential annexation by the City, drainage, and traffic congestion. The article mentions the success of the Sandia Heights Swim Team, booming residential construction, gardening club gatherings, and an introduction of SHHA's Board of Directors. A variety of local services is advertised, including tutoring, custom framing, insurance services, and neighborhood coffees. Classified style ads ranging from babysitting to house sitting services as well as items for sale are also included. The article ends with announcements for upcoming community events such as the Holiday Craft Bazaar and typical gatherings of Sandia Heights' artisans.
