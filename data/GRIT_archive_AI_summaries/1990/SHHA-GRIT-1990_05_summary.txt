The SHHA has its annual meeting and elections in June and encourages participation from all their members. The current road conditions in Sandia Heights have been a cause for concern, with little maintenance done despite tax funds being available. However, appreciation has been shown for various community and board members for their efforts in the SHHA. In 1989, Sandia Peak Tram Co. transferred the responsibilities for road upkeep to the County, yet minimal road maintenance has been performed. The community is also dealing with issues such as a proposed large residential development, littering, and improper yard waste disposal. The SHHA has highlighted various events and initiatives, like the annual Holiday Crafts Bazaar and the Service Referral Program. Several notable actions include home construction and renovations in Spring 1988 and the practice of harvesting rainwater for city orchards. The Sandia Heights Wildflower Club and the Albuquerque Sister Cities Program are also highlighted as important community activities. The SHHA Architectural Review Committee can charge a fee to cover various costs related to the approval and implementation of construction plans. Lastly, SHHA offers free advertising space for its members in the non commercial section and various classifieds services are available to the community.
