In January 2013, the Roadrunner Holiday Food Drive was successfully orchestrated, along with a Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert headlined by Carolyn Martin, a decorated Western Swing vocalist. The concert was arranged by the SHHA, which also recently updated its website. These updates give members the ability to adjust specific property details and gain access to member only features, including information on tram pass availability. Further, a cherished Italian bobsled gift emerged as the highlight of Raton's neighborhood, creating a lifelong bond within the community. The notable features include: SHHA has Betsy Rodriguez and Sheraz Saint LÃ´t holding key positions within the association. Members can access eight daily corporate tram passes, effective from January 1, 2013. SHHA's Membership Card offers discounts at several local stores. Sandia Heights Services (SHS) continues to provide independent security services to the neighborhood. Meanwhile, Linda Caldwell, with her 34 year real estate track record, offers an enjoyable and effortless moving process for both sellers and buyers. Her portfolio includes home related services provided by Waterwise Landscapes Incorporated. SHHA urged members to pay attention to parking and storage regulations within the community, and improper storing of trailers, mobile homes, boats, and recreational vehicles topped the list of violations. Board approved renovation and landscaping projects are available for review by the community. Residents should note: Room rentals or running bed and breakfast services in residential areas, as well as improper storage of refuse bins, violate county zoning laws. The GRIT's ACC Chairman, Bob Bower, summarized 2012 published articles addressing numerous subjects, including residential photovoltaic systems, design and construction plans, wildfire precautions, and useful project planning tips. As reminders, SHHA disseminated information about snow removal services, office hours, board meetings, member services, and community events. Christmas tree disposal recommendations were also provided. The 2013 Sandia Heights Art Tour and the 5th Annual Three Kings Party at St. Chad's Episcopal Church were among the annual community events. Residents were encouraged to visit sandiahomeowners.org to enjoy captivating photos and other featured works. Additionally, there is an open submission for the 2014 directory.
