At the June 2013 annual meeting, a change to bylaws was enacted shifting the annual meeting to a Saturday in February. As a result, a special meeting is to be held at the Church of The Good Shepherd on November 9 for voting on three proposed amendments. These amendments aim to reduce the board member minimum from 14 to 11 and can be previewed on the SHHA website. The GRIT publication gains financial support primarily from ad revenues, urging residents to patronize the advertised businesses. Resident directory listings must be updated or confirmed by November 10, 2013. The SHHA office routinely handles covenant violation complaints with an established procedure for reporting and resolving these violations. For safety, residents are advised against leaving valuable items in their cars, ignoring knocks when home, and leaving garage remotes in cars. Free sales and marketing consultations are offered by Pete Veres of Elite Asset Management team. The ACC urges homeowners to submit design and construction plans for early approval to ensure compliance with Unit covenants and ACC Design Guidelines. Residents must report any alterations that diverge from approved plans, even minor changes, to maintain covenant compliance. The ACC provides Design Guidelines focused on aspects such as Detached Buildings, Landscaping, Roofing, Setbacks and Variances, Solar Collectors, and Walls and Fences. Services at the Church of Good Shephard, events like "I Do!" hosted by the Sandia Presbyterian Church, and the annual Blessing of Animals at St. Chad's Episcopal Church are additional community offerings highlighted. Sandia Heights Artists thank attendees of their Studio Art Tour and hope for continued attendance in their future events. Al and Marie Ratner have taken over management of the "Cork & Fork" dining event. The SHHA invites community members to submit entries for its annual photo contest with the winning photograph to be featured on the cover of Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide 2014. The entries should be related to Sandia Heights and cannot be submitted by professional photographers.
