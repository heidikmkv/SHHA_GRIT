The Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series will welcome acclaimed Americana singer/songwriter Claudia Nygaard on April 13th at the Church of Good Shepherd. Noted for her wit and emotive storytelling, Nygaard's CD, "Let the Storm Roll In," has high chart rankings and 5 star reviews. All ages are welcome, with tickets at $5, free for SHHA members. Concerns on local ecology have been raised by SHHA President Ann Zimmerman along with local residents Ed and Virginia Fultz. They highlight the harm outdoor cats pose to bird and mammal populations, and the substantial decrease in different animal species within the neighborhood. They call for community efforts to manage cat population and responsible homeownership to avoid water runoff and erosion issues. Crime within the area, including theft and vandalism, persists with guidelines to secure homes and avoid delays in trash disposal. Other focal points for the community include the introduction of energy efficient roofing materials, despite existing covenants, to curb energy consumption, with an updated ACC Design Guideline for Roofing published in December 2009. SHHA, beyond normal services, offers several member benefits and anticipates bylaw changes. Heights Interior and Exterior Painting, well respected for their service, can be contacted for related inquiries. SHHA office hours are from Monday to Friday between 9 am to 4 pm, with closures on Memorial Day and an upcoming board meeting on May 8 at 7 pm. The bustling Sandia Heights community also features upcoming events, such as the Spring Fever Fest, Sandia Heights Artists tour, Sandia Heights Cork & Fork dining activity, and an art show featuring Diane M. Mueller's oil paintings at O’Neill’s Pub from March 27 through April 27. The annual SHHA meeting will be held at the Church of the Good Shepherd on June 8, 2013.
