The SHHA community will host several events and initiatives including: An annual members only Easter Egg Hunt at WL Jackson Park on March 30. Wellness initiatives and community updates from President Ann Zimmerman, which urge members to respect community covenants, for example by not parking spring and summer "toys" or units on properties. Voting on policy changes such as a proposed bylaw amendment to change the annual meeting date on June 8. Enhanced home security, garbage management improvements, and a Claudia Nygaard concert in the Coffeehouse Concert Series on April 13 (mind the tram maintenance closure from April 1st to 19th). Additional community updates include: The clarification that Sandia Heights Services' utility membership does not automatically grant SHHA membership. Recommendations against open burning, for dog leashing in parks, proper home renovation, and working with proper contractors. The community also offers notary services, contractor evaluations, and open community groups like Church of the Good Shepherd, Sandia Heights Artists, Cork & Fork group, and Sandia Heights Book Club. Members can also find information about local bobcat sightings, nothing to worry about, on the SHHA website. Lastly, a reminder that daylight savings time commences on March 10.
