Syd Masters & the Swing Riders will be performing at the Church of the Good Shepherd on Saturday, September 14. The event is organized by the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association and offers general admission or free entry for SHHA members and their guests. New Mexico is facing increasing issues regarding its wildlife and vegetation due to an ongoing drought. Residents are being encouraged to partake in deep root watering and removal of dead trees and shrubs. Concerns have been raised about increasing encounters between humans and bears due to housing developments near the mountains, leading to laws requiring bear proof garbage containers and tips to prevent attracting bears to residential areas. The Sandia Heights Security Patrol advises vigilance to deter theft and burglary, such as responding if someone knocks during the day and always locking cars. The text includes housing related advertisements and guidance, including tips for increasing landscape efficiency, maintaining excellent water supply, and reducing potential burglary. All landscape modifications must be submitted to the ACC. A log of recently approved ACC projects is included, and homeowners are reminded to submit a revegetation plan if they've disturbed over 400 square feet. The SHHA office hours are 9am 4pm, Monday to Friday. An SHHA Board Meeting is scheduled for August 14. Notary updates, committee meetings, classified ads, and an announcement of committee members' offers are also included, and all are updated on the SHHA website. The Sandia Heights Artist tour and the annual photo contest for the 2014 Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide are also coming up, along with a reminder that long term parking of recreational vehicles, travel trailers, and boats is prohibited.
