In November 2013, the SHHA scheduled a special meeting to discuss proposed amendments, including one to decrease the minimum board member requirement from fourteen to eleven. These amendments were open for review on the SHHA website. SHHA also initiated a holiday food drive with the Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, providing a collection point for non perishable items at their San Rafael and Tramway offices, thanking all participants. The association also runs a merchant program offering discounts to members from various services providers if the property owners maintain membership with the SHHA. SHHA sends out a GRIT newsletter that sends alerts about activities in Sandia Heights, including wildlife alerts and security issues. On the topic of security, SHHA offers an array of security tips but mainly emphasizes on light pollution, encouraging homeowners to abide by the Bernalillo County Code, which mandates that all lights must be off between 11:00 pm and sunrise. Precautionary measures for homes during winter are urgently advised, especially for homes' exteriors and water supply lines. The SHHA recommends disconnecting water hoses and protecting outdoor faucets to prevent freezing damage. Furthermore, the SHHA website also provides updates about maintenance and upgrade projects in the neighborhood. Max Sanchez was highlighted for his achievement in 2012 as a Coldwell Banker agent. The newsletters also provide updates on community services, events, and hours of operation. The SHHA hosts a monthly "Cork & Fork" dining activity and encourages new members to participate in this communal gathering, the contact person being Al, reachable at 856 1984 or mariaratner@msn.com. The association's address is 2 B San Rafael Ave NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.
