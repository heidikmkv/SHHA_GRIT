The SHHA released their July 2013 edition of The Grit, noting potential revisions found on their website. The edition included a poignant piece by member Lawrence Fultz reflecting on the Lexington and Concord battle and committee meeting schedules, announcements, and notices such as member discounts. They've begun transitioning to an online, environmentally friendly and cost effective version with hyperlinks, high resolution images, and multimedia potential. The SHHA also issues alerts for wildlife sightings, security issues, and offers benefits such as daily corporate tram passes. The Parks & Safety Committee handles park maintenance, established a Doggie Pooh station and encourages dead plant removal due to drought. The Sandia Height Services offer services such as water and security, remind residents of their vacation watch service, and provide tips to manage wildlife interactions. The edition mentioned property sales by Sharon and Judon McColl and announced an upcoming concert. The Covenant Support Committee and the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) have handled member complaints, reviewed and approved project applications based on harmony with the environment and conducted ACC electronic archiving. The text concluded with information about the longstanding "Cork & Fork" dining activity, the upcoming Sandia Heights Studio Art Tour, the newly forming Route 66 Sounds group, and details for an annual photo contest with a deadline on November 1st.
