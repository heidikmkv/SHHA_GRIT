From April 1st to October 31st, 2018, Bernalillo County enforced water restriction regulations prohibiting the use of sprinkler irrigation from 11am 7pm, excluding methods like drip irrigation or hand watering. These regulations were to prevent water wastage, which, if violated, could be reported to the Bernalillo County Water Waste Hotline. The county recommended certain home water conservation strategies and the use of rainwater collection, and offered incentive programs for conservation efforts. Additionally, the county imposed bans on the use and sale of certain fireworks, particularly in wildland areas and unincorporated parts of the county, to prevent property damage and potential fire hazards. Dead tree cutting and removal were advised especially in fire prone areas and residents, particularly in Sandia Heights, were encouraged to maintain their landscapes. Additional rules included light regulation to maintain dark skies, with outdoor lighting prohibited between 11 p.m. and sunrise. SHHA offered a range of discount programs for members and services including security, water, sewer, and trash collection. The community underwent various property improvements and SHHA facilitated community involvement through surveys and co existence strategies with local wildlife. The local community bulletin board provided details about community events and the SHHA office provided various member services and resources. To receive community alerts, members were instructed to subscribe via email. Corrections regarding the printed version of the GRIT could be accessed on the SHHA website. The physical address for the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association is 2 B San Rafael Ave. NE, Albuquerque, NM 87122.
