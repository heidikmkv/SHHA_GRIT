Several Board of Director terms for the Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association (SHHA) are due to expire in 2019 and replacement members are being sought, specifically from the newer, younger families in the community. SHHA is launching a wildfire prevention project in October using goats to clear overgrown vegetation from local arroyos known as potential "rivers of fire". Homeowners linked to these areas are encouraged to participate. Information about November 2018 events and services is given, including the end of Daylight Saving Time, early voting and Election Day details, security statistics, member benefits and feedback, as well as news about Sandia Heights Services. SHHA's newsletter also reminds residents about mail security measures and recommends the use of Informed Delivery from USPS for monitoring outgoing letters. Updates on ongoing and approved construction and maintenance projects in Sandia Heights are mentioned, along with insights into the density of communication and broadcast antennas in the area. Community activities and groups seeking members or participants include Chestra, an amateur orchestra; the Sandia Heights Cork & Fork Dining Activity; and the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus interested parties are supplied with requisite contact details. General announcements include SHHA office hours and services, holiday office closures, information on the upcoming board meeting, and the 2019 SHHA Resident Guide & Directory's annual photo contest.
