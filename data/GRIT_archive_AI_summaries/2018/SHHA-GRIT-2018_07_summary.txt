On May 15, 2018, the High Desert community evaded a significant wildfire that originated in an underpopulated drainage filled with grass, shrubs, and trees. Occurring under warm, dry and windy conditions, it threatened residences, damaged communication lines, and prompted a discussion regarding emergency preparedness; it emphasized fire prevention and enforced a fireworks ban for unincorporated county regions. Notices encourage reporting illegal fireworks use, and a Wildfire Preparedness Committee has been established by the SHHA to guide residents. It recommends creating a safe space around houses, crafting evacuation plans, packing an emergency "go bag," teaching family members to disconnect utilities, preparing for pet evacuation, keeping an emergency weather radio, and having a list of items to grab during an evacuation. Also, Public Utility Easements (PUEs) are present at most residences' property edges, allowing utility companies to install underground utilities. Residents are urged to report damage, though the county is not responsible for any drains outside these easements. The Fire Department encourages residents to clean chimneys and stove pipes after wood heating seasons to avoid fire hazards. Volunteers' role is highlighted in firefighting and to address current shortfalls, additional training will be offered. Additionally, residents are reminded of community events, including dining activities, art tours, and job opportunities through newsletters. SHHA office at Albuquerque, New Mexico, will be closed for Independence Day on July 4th, with any corrections to newsletters available on the SHHA website.
