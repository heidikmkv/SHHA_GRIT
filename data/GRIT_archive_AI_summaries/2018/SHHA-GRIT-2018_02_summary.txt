President Joe Pappe of the SHHA Annual Association has announced the replacement of verbal reports with accessible written reports before meetings as part of a new model to expedite business discussions and focus more on strategic planning. The Association also emphasizes guidelines for community aesthetics, solicits the community for newsletter content, and is currently accepting entries for its annual photo contest. SHHA members are provided with numerous benefits such as access to key guidelines, discounted Tramway passes, and discounts from merchandisers. The Association welcomes member contributions and queries and has listed methods of contact for the Security and article submissions. The enforcement of property covenants by the Architecture Control Committee (ACC) and the compliance of homeowners have been highlighted. Also, residents are advised to prepare for winter traveling and living conditions and check for road closures due to severe winter conditions. The SHHA office will be closed on Monday, February 19, 2018, in observance of President's Day. * Verbal reports replaced with accessible written reports * Emphasis on community aesthetics * Content solicitation for Association newsletter, and annual photo contest * Member benefits (Tramway pass discounts, contributing to the Association) * Enforcement of property covenants by ACC * Winter preparation advice * SHHA office closure on President's Day.
