The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) is promoting community cohesion and resilience through new initiatives and reminders for members: SHHA now offers a voter registration service, facilitated by Betsy Rodriguez and Jessica Seeley, to increase convenience for members. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) has reiterated rules regarding long term parking of recreational vehicles, trailers, and boats in community spaces. SHHA members are advised to provide necessary changes for the 2019 Resident Guide and Directory before the deadline on October 26th, 2018. Households are encouraged to prepare a "go bag" for possible emergencies, particularly wildfires. The bag should contain important items such as insurance documents, medical supplies, food, and essentials for pets. Two new housing developments, "Hawks Landing" and "Las Pradas," are under construction, despite residents' expressed desire for the spaces to stay vacant. SHHA members can access numerous online services and alerts through a simple email registration process. SHHA is preparing for the 2018 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta which will feature events like laser light shows, balloon launches, and an AfterGlowâ„¢ Fireworks Show. Acknowledging the nighttime environment as a crucial natural resource, SHHA supports the International Dark Sky Association, which highlights the significant impact artificial lights can have on our interaction with the natural night sky. Other community activities include the 2018 Sandia Heights Art Tour, job vacancies at local institutions, the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Orchestra, and a photo contest for the Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory. In addition to these initiatives, SHHA is ensuring the separation of subscription services and association membership, and continues to uphold community standards.
