The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association board has elected its officers for 2018, led by President Woody Farber and Vice President Hugh Prather. The board also includes a range of members covering various committee chairs and two office staffs. The board is known for enforcing covenant compliance, recently taking legal action against a violator. Regular operations include handling a high volume of calls, with key services separate from the Association membership. Membership does offer various discounts and benefits with participating merchants. Additionally, SHHA runs competitions such as the Resident Guide and Directory cover photo contest. The board has also planned an annual strategic planning session on February 17, 2018. Throughout the year, property improvements in the community are carefully monitored, with various projects scheduled for the early part of the year. Information on these projects is found on the Association's website. Other community initiatives include dialogue on secondary poisoning due to Open Bait Traps, the popular Cork & Fork Dining Activity, and promoting the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus for young music enthusiasts. Association office hours are Monday to Friday, 9 am to 4 pm, however, there are upcoming holiday closures including New Year's Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
