The SHHA held their annual meeting on June 4th, 2005, where they discussed various issues including: The election of new board members, nominations were; Dick Cline, James S. Irving, William Wiley, Bill Johnson, and Ralph Rudolph. Voting on proposed bylaw changes, mainly clarifications regarding the Board of Directors' election procedures. Resident concerns over property development, specifically the proposed Mhoon property development on Paseo del Norte and Tramway. Expansion of the ice rink and speed hump installations to curb speeding issues. Organization of community building activities such as neighborhood cleanups, grill days, and holiday get togethers. Throughout the year, the association focused on handling increasing construction requests, curbing commercial development along Tramway, and refining covenants for resident voting. The SHHA also hosted the successful 11th annual Sandia Heights wine tasting event, with plans to move to a larger venue in the future. Various changes to unspecified document sections were also proposed, such as assigning the responsibility of agenda setting to the President and preventing continuous proxy votes. The association maintains a webpage for members to advertise their services and needs, where currently listed items include housekeeping and pet care services, odd jobs, and items for sale. Lost and found items can be claimed at the SHHA office. Additionally, an application for a video arcade caf√© license was rejected due to existing zoning restrictions. SHHA continues their community service and invites more volunteers for this effort.
