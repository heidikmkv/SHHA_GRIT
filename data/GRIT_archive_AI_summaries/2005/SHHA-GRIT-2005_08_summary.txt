In August 2005, the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association hosted a successful dedication event for W. L. Jackson Park, and a meeting where two new board members, Dick Brackett and Ed Tull, were elected. They debated proposed speed humps on Tramway Lane, while clarifying the status of the Unified Covenants to the homeowners. Significant events included a Jazz Night Under the Stars and Antique and Classic Car Show and a picnic that took place on July 24. The Treasurer reported on the association's cash flow and assets and liabilities for June. The board expressed their support for speed humps, prioritizing safety and county protocol in decision making. A board established Ad Hoc Committee conducted a survey indicating many residents felt unsafe traveling on a particular avenue. Top modifications favored were creating a pathway and installing speed humps. These modifications involve resident participation and include ongoing education and a strong emphasis on the maintenance of covenants to enhance property values. Community activities included a progressive dinner and mini garden tour, a Garden Walk showcasing gardens, and a field trip to El Rancho de los Golondrinas. Upcoming events feature a potluck dinner, and the refurbished Quail Run Center, now owned by Emerald Properties, is set to enhance its offerings. A section of the announcement consisted of classified advertisements and public notices. It touched on the mystery of a continuous low rumbling noise, named the "Maddening Hum" by local resident Phillip Ciofalo. Several possible causes were mentioned, and the scientific community was urged to investigate.
