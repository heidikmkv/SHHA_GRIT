The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, headed by President Ralph Rudolph, is actively addressing local matters of commercial development and traffic congestion. They are petitioning against the Mhoon property's transformation into a shopping center and are against the ice rink expansion due to projected traffic concerns. They are also working on traffic calming solutions in San Rafael and examining the decision making powers of the Architectural Review Committee (ACC) and Covenant Support Committee (CSC). In fostering a vibrant community, various events are planned amongst which ArtsView is set for June and October, encompassing open house art viewings by local artists. The treasurer reported cash in bank of $105,190.41 and total assets of $120,981.34 as of February 2005. Social events like coffees, picnics, and jazz nights are also planned, organized by the Membership Services Committee. A fundraiser for Casa Esperanza, led by Keller Williams Realty, is set for April 23rd, 2005. The association is seeking new board members with several tenures due for expiration this year. The ACC has also reminded residents to submit all building proposals for approval to avoid work suspension surprises. Further, the association operates from Albuquerque and encourages community input, sharing updates through "Early Blooming Plants" presentations and other activities. They have an upcoming Annual Garden Walk scheduled for June 11th, and they shared membership details for the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club. The Committee also highlighted the ongoing issues with covenant violations. They also shared classifieds for various services, available serviced suites, and items for sale, including a 2000 Pontiac Bonneville SSEI.
