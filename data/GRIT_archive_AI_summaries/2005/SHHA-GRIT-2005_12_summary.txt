The SHHA stresses the need to uphold community standards to protect property values. They're ready to take legal action based on violation severity, resolution difficulty, and available funds. They highlight a new wastewater treatment ordinance effective from January 1, 2015, which they're studying to understand its potential implications. They've formed a committee to stay updated on related issues. The First Sandia Heights Coffeehouse is planned to occur on January 14, featuring Acoustic Eidolon and requesting a $15 donation. To improve community connectivity, the Parks and New Development Committee have planned a walking path project, for which they've secured funds. They're also contemplating acquiring an access easement to the National Forest open space, and have sanctioned $200 to enhance a school bus stop. Following a rise in local vandalism, they've requested Sandia Heights Security's help and are encouraging residents to stay alert. They've asked for resident feedback to regulate building aesthetics and have listed out their responsibilities. Rio Grande Ace Hardware, a new outlet housing over 20,000 products, will open soon and revolutionize the home improvement shopping experience. For traffic safety and environmental issues, SHHA requests residents to directly contact Bernalillo County Dispatch. They also advocate for responsible driving at 15 mph and provide a process for addressing speed concerns. The SHHA office functions on weekdays and is run by an executive team: President Ed Whitten, VP Thomas Coyne, Treasurer Dick Cline, and Secretary Marsha Thole. They offer notary public services and publish The GRIT, a publication promoting balanced views. They don't publish unsigned submissions and hold the right to edit them.
