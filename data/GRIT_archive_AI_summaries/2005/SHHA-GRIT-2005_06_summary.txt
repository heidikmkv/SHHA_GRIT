Ralph Rudolph, former President of the SHHA, has stepped down and has been succeeded by Ed Whitten, with Tom Coyne, Marsha Thole, and Glen Cheney elected as Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer respectively. Following this change in leadership, several significant steps have been taken: A board meeting and annual SHHA meeting were convened to discuss pressing community issues, including the allowance of $98,223.20 left in the bank after a deduction of $17,229.64 for association expenses. Traffic concerns in the area were addressed, with "one way chokers" replaced with speed humps on popular demand. However, residents express dissatisfaction with traffic measures, despite the installation of speed humps. The new board is using this feedback for future safety decisions. In response to concerns about speed bumps delaying emergency vehicles, the community has asked for more clearly visible address numbers and is working on rectifying 911 response times, which are longer from mobile devices. A soil analysis indicates that the application of nitrogen could benefit plant growth, and community based activities, such as a Couples Gourmet Club and various clubs for outdoor activities, have been proposed. An inline skating event will be hosted on June 25, and a pitch to form the Sandia Heights Couples Gourmet Club is in progress. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) has managed and overseen about 275 projects, with a log project available on the SHHA website detailing all advancements. They also have scheduled Neighborhood Reviews and Meetings for projects that may significantly change views. The New Mexico state legislature has granted funding to finish W.L. Jackson Park, which will include various recreational facilities and improvements. And finally, the Arts View @ Sandia Heights event is scheduled to feature pieces from seven notable local artists, and updated classified ads are now only available on the SHHA's website.
