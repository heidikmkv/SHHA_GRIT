Sandia Heights, an evolving community since 1969, has seen development from pioneering neighborly cooperation to structured organization led by a dedicated board of directors. Over time, tasks have diversified from simple duties like swapping newspaper routes to complex duties such as managing park construction and myriad covenant issues. Specialized committees like Covenant Control Committee and Architectural Control Committee have been initiated to address housing issues. Community activities have increased over time, with bridge games and social events fostering unity. Additionally, community meetings, volunteer efforts for trail construction, and security services that work closely with local law enforcement agencies have enhanced the livability and safety of the region. Community newsletter, THE GRIT, provides a platform for both non commercial and commercial ads offers community messaging and opens opportunities for local services. Local services advertised include Southwest Interior Design, music instruction, various childcare and pet care options, and a choir seeking new female members. The job board includes varied roles from odd jobs like tumbleweed removal to professional services like personal security. Park maintenance and jogging/cycling trails development have been an ongoing project with residents and board members volunteering. Community safety is prioritized with the Security Patrol working closely with local law enforcement agencies, covering thousands of miles in and around Sandia Heights, contributing to decreased crime rates. Community covenants regulate neighborhood practices like parking and home renovations which are overseen by the Architectural Control Committee. Activities like watercolor classes are organized for younger residents and residents are invited to the new interdenominational church. Meanwhile, issues relating to refuse collection, uncontrolled animals, traffic violations, and rules surrounding modifications or installations to homes are highlighted for community attention. A public notice about a found duffle bag was made, highlighting collaborations towards common concerns in the community.
