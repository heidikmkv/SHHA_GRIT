The Sandia Heights Homeowners Board is gearing up for a productive year filled with momentous achievements. Notable accomplishments already include the installation of an illuminated bulletin board between Circle K and the Outpost Arena, publicizing important occurrences and future events, and the placement of concrete amenities in the park including tables, benches, and a trash receptacle. Key projects, such as the development of jogging paths, are set to commence. Imminent changes will transpire as tasks shift from the Sandia Peak Tram Company to the homeowners association, which the latter is preparing dutifully to handle. The board is actively formulating long term strategies, drafting a mission statement, and establishing goals and objectives. Community park enhancements also include a softball park with a backstop, a child friendly playground, basketball goals, new park benches, picnic tables, and a litter bin. The board aims to construct a jogging trail system by spring to connect Sandia Heights, and install a permanent workout course at the park. The park improvements cater to all forms of human powered transportation, with the community invited to participate in planning. The bulletin board, generously facilitated by Bob and Pat Martin, is open for non commercial posts with Lynne Behnfield and Carolyn Hudson as the go to contacts for posting. "The Wool Warehouse Theatre" will host an event on March 22nd with transport, dinner, and show set for Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. Assorted community services include games, tutoring, house and animal sitting, and mail services while local businesses offer yard work, home improvement consultations, and tax services. Regular reminders about maintaining the community's quality of life are disseminated, and "Spring Fling" has been organized for Memorial Day, May 25th. Nancye H. Hudgins offers a range of antique and modern textiles, while Coronado Academy Child Development Center and Enchantment Landscapes offer child development and landscape maintenance services, respectively. An original dessert named "Chocolate Decadence" has been shared along with appreciation to the Bernalillo County Fire Department (BCFD), particularly District 5, for their assistance after an emergency at the O'Neals' home during a heavy snowstorm. Finally, the neighborhood newsletter, THE GRIT, will now be published bi monthly, and details regarding advertising rates have been shared.
