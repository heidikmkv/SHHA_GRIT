The SHHA has been actively improving the community's amenities and services, including expansion of Trammay Boulevard, which will introduce a walking/jogging path. The association is also dealing with covenant violations, urging non compliant homeowners to take action, and seeking improved law enforcement coverage. With Sandia Peak Tram Company ceasing its services, the Strategic Planning Committee is seeking input on the community's future. Residents were applauded for their cooperation in the recent road maintenance program, and calls were made for more volunteer firefighters. Various neighborhood interest groups are set up, and volunteers for organizing and hosting various activities, including theater and opera visits, are requested. Regular neighborhood coffees are held monthly welcoming newcomers and men. Reported theft incidents necessitate car lock safety, and parents are reminded to keep children away from construction sites. The SHHA Board is seeking volunteer lawyers for a legal committee. Both service providers and users are noted, including babysitters, dog walkers, house sitters, errand runners, yard workers, and musicians of varying ages, and those offering specialized services. Advertisements for items (a Lowrey console piano, Yamaha guitar, JC Penney men's bike) and services (light ironing) are listed. Miscellaneous notes mention a chorus group seeking female voices and an Albuquerque resale boutique for home furnishings. Contact numbers, election information, and volunteering opportunities for the neighborhood newsletter are provided along with a bulletin board for further announcements. The SHHA thanks and encourages residents for their active participation and offers various services and activities to maintain and improve the community.
