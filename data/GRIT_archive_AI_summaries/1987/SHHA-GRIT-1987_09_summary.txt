The Covenant Control Committee (CCC) is sustaining efforts to improve living standards for the owners of Sandia Heights homes by confirming their compliance with community covenants, while also managing challenges and nuisance issues from noncompliant homeowners. An initiative with the Bernalillo County Road Maintenance Program is in play to clear overgrown vegetation from road edges in Sandia Heights, with homeowner participation being encouraged. Furthermore, the Homeowner's Association has initiated a study due to increased coyote sightings and is also handling several community needs, including bulletin boards for messages, picnics, park upgrades, and more. The CCC monitors homeowners for covenant infringements, such as unauthorized parking and noise disturbances. County and homeowners are collaborating to address vegetation overgrowth on roads. There are numerous upcoming events and available services for Sandia Heights residents, ranging from social gatherings to business advertisements. The association's newsletter, THE GRIT, provides a platform for these services and news. An elaborate guide on local trails and how to explore them is also included. Various services and businesses are available in Albuquerque, including travel services, landscaping, and home constructions. Information on upcoming community events and business advertisements are accessible in THE GRIT.
