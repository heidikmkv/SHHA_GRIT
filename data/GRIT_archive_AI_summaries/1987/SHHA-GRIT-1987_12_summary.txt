On December 28, 1987, Sandia Fesk Utility Corporation announced its plan to raise water rates by minimum 25.79%, with additional charges for consumption over 9000 gallons/month. A rate case is filed with the New Mexico Public Service Commission for endorsement of these changes. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association is reviewing the public document available at the Trammay office. An explanatory meeting by the Utility Corporation is scheduled for January 5, 1988. Post approval, owners won't be able to impact the rate structure, thus attendance is urged. On January 6, 1988, the Homeowners Association will conduct another meeting at the new fire station to discuss the rate package, answer questions, and gauge homeowner consent or disapproval. Any motion against the rate change should be filed by January 19, 1988. A focused discussion on the Utility Company's operation and associated costs will take place during this meeting. Unless challenged legitimately, a hearing on March 5, 1988, will verify the rate increase. Involvement is strongly urged, if unable to attend, please ensure your decision reaches the Homeowners Association.
