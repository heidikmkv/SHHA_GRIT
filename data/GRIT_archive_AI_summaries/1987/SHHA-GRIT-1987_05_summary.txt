As the President's term concludes at the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, accomplishments and contributions from members like Judy Harris, Bill Jackson, Don McBride, Dennis Burt, the Membership Committee, Roger Hoppe, Mike Cox, Harry Ottinger, Jim Randall, Ralph Tate, Sara Warford, Rod Stewart and Jack Wirtz are recognized. The community is looking forward to upcoming events, including "A Spring Fling" triathlon on May 25th and an annual meeting on May 30th, aimed to discuss the implementation of future Association goals. The association also appreciates John Freeman and Cleve Matthew, and urges residents to utilize the Four Seasons Club's amenities and participate in the upkeep of the park and trails. Property owners are reminded to adhere to fire hydrant ordinance for safety reasons and are invited to partake in a study conducted by Albuquerque Environmental Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control Plague Lab for controlling rodents and fleas. Residents are advised to undertake home improvement projects during spring, use the community bulletin board, and attend various community activities including Church of the Good Shepherd's Sunday Services and the Sandia Heights Opera Club. The board cautions against property trespassing, door to door solicitors, and illegal fireworks usage. "The Grit" bulletin will now be published six times a year and offer advertisement options at different rates. The community also benefits from multiple local business offerings.
