In his April 2015 report, George Connor, Secretary of the SHHA, highlighted the efforts of the association to address member queries, comply with the 2013 NM HOA Act and encourage community involvement. Key points in their new regulation include: All association concerns and questions should be directed to the association's official email, with responses coming within 8 10 business days. Monthly board meetings, which members can attend, are listed online. Financial information, including the 2015 Board Approved Budget, is available for review on the association's website. Any additional queries can be directed to the treasurer. Secretary Connor and Chairman Woody Farber appreciate the positive feedback they received following the restructuring of the SHHA's information management. Homeowners are reminded about the SHHA's email alert system and the need to keep their contact information up to date. Homeowners are also reminded to respect covenant restrictions pertaining to vehicles, property use, landscaping, and concealment of trash bins. Residents can enhance home security by using commercial locks, marking valuables, and videotaping home contents. Conservation efforts are encouraged to protect local bird species and pi√±on pines, both affected by climate change. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) approves home improvement projects and provides guidance for homeowners. Residents are offered opportunities for community involvement, such as hosting foreign students, participating in dining events (such as "Cork & Fork"), the annual art tour, Holy Week events, and an annual photo contest.
