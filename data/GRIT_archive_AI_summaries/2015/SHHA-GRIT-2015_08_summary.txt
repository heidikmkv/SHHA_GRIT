The SHHA Board has objected to a "Coneflower" artwork by Christopher Weed to be displayed at W.L. Jackson Park due to disharmony with the natural surroundings. Board meeting agendas will be published online 48 hours ahead and members are urged to attend upon notifying the office. Classified ads, cleanliness ordinances, and benefits of SHHA membership, such as tram passes and merchant discounts, were discussed. Property owners and tenants can avail SHHA membership benefits, with the exception of voting privileges and filing covenant violation complaints for renters. The SHHA encourages residents to observe traffic and safety rules, maintain clean sight triangles and remove obstructions for road safety. Security services are separate from SHHA membership. The Albuquerque Police Department reported 343 incidents and emphasized community engagement and optimal outdoor lighting conditions for burglary prevention. Homeowners are also guided on requisition of plat plans necessary for property remodeling, importance of building permits for construction work, and securing them through licensed contractors. The SHHA offers services such as notary, copies and faxes, email alerts, a contractor evaluation binder, and tram pass discounts. The community partakes in events like the Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour and the annual photo contest, with winning photos being featured on the Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide 2016.
