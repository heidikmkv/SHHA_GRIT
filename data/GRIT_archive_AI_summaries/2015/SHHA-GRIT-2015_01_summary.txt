In the 2015 2016 operational year for the Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association (SHHA), Joe Pappe, Josephine Porter, George Connor and Woody Farber were elected for President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer respectively. The February Annual Meeting agenda included voting for Josephine Porter and Meeko Oishi for another 3 year term and potential board members Marsha Thole and Bill Wiley. SHHA provides multiple benefits for residents and renters, such as corporate tram passes. Notable directives are: the disposal of taller trees (over 6 feet, cut in half), calling the county for snow removal, and abiding by the County Ordinance for pet clean ups on public property. The Roadrunner Holiday Food Drive and recycling programs showed high participation with recycling reaching 80% involvement. The real estate services of Sharon and Judson McCollum have also made a significant impact on local property values in Sandia Heights. Financially, SHHA's strong position led to member dues reduction from $10 to $8. The recycling program's benefits include offsetting recycling costs. An essential focus on the community includes clean surroundings, strict adherence to the Bernalillo County Code for light pollution, and storing bins out of public sight. Investigations for suspected covenant violations ensure compliance within the community. Approvals for multiple homes' maintenance tasks and installations, as well as community updates, are available. Greg Lobberget's real estate expertise has been benefiting Sandia Heights since 1983. SHHA offers products such as vests for $2, discounts from partner companies, and regularly features member submitted photographs on their website. Planned activities include the release of the 2015 resident directory and email alerts for area activities. The next SHHA meeting is slated for February 7th, 2015, at the Church of the Good Shepherd.
