The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) has recently updated its Rules and Regulations, adding new sections on Association Records and resident conduct. Board meeting agendas will now be published on the website 48 hours before each meeting, and approved meeting minutes will also be uploaded. Residents were also informed about a positive outcome of a zoning variance request by other SHHA residents for the signage of a new Domino's restaurant. Additionally, the move to using the online version of the GRIT publication is strongly encouraged, as it offers more features and saves membership cost. Members were notified of the problem with gnats in Sandia Heights and were advised that Cedar oil is an effective solution found on the SHHA website. SHHA also reminded about proper trash and recycle bins storage to maintain cleanliness and beauty in the area. The SHHA is also inviting entries for its 2016 directory photo contest. Updates on ongoing construction projects were shared, with Tom Solomon, a local resident, advocating for the benefits of solar panels as a more sustainable electricity option. In other announcements, the SHHA office will be closed on July 3rd for Independence Day; the Artists Studio Tour is scheduled for September 12 and 13; and the Day Time Bridge Players are looking for new members. Moreover, the association offers safety vests for purchase and encourages residents to get membership cards for different discounts. Lastly, all SHHA members are urged to observe Independence Day responsibly while the SHHA office is closed.
