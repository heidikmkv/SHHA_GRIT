Panorama Homes Inc. has filed a zone change to R 2 for the Mhoon Property located at 891 Tramway Lane, which allows owner to construct various structures without a site plan. The SHHA opposes this change and encourages residents to voice their opinion. The SHHA has waived its members' monthly dues for October and November due to increased revenues and reduced expenses. Billing errors will result in fees without charges for November and December. An open meeting involving the election and introduction of SHHA Board members will be held, featuring presentations, a Town Hall segment, and door prizes for early attendees. Residents can avail a Free Green Waste pickup service by Sandia Peak Utility from November 30 to December 4. From December 24 to January 4, the SHHA office will be closed for holidays. Sandia Heights Services offers varied subscriptions, and residents are advised to be cautious about displaying Christmas gifts, particularly while unloading them from vehicles and if their home is visible from the street. In real estate, brokers Sharon and Judson McCollum, along with Skye White and Paul White are experts in the Sandia Heights region providing free market analysis services and contributing to clients' closing costs. Property owners are urged by the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to submit initial applications for major construction projects to identify any potential issues. The newsletter also mentions ACC managed enhancement projects and ongoing CSC violations in the community, suggesting homeowners refer to the ACC website for more info. Local events include Christmas celebrations at St Chad's Episcopal Church including a celebration of St. Nicholas on December 5th, and the placement of a memorial bench in Jackson Park honoring Robert “Bob” Christman.
