In 2015, the Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) convened for their annual meeting, with the election of Joe Pappe as President, Josephine Porter as Vice President, George Connor as Secretary, and Woody Farber as Treasurer. The vote also included nominations for returning board members Josephine Porter and Meeko Oishi, and new members Marsha Thole and Bill Wiley. Key points discussed in the meeting included: The importance of community participation, politeness, and respect for the rules in meetings. Ongoing issues with mail theft, with recommendations for the residents to secure their mail and report any suspicious activities to the relevant authorities. Advice on septic tank usage and the need for residents to guard against unchecked weed growth on their properties. Announcement of upcoming price hikes by the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) and a new monthly interconnection fee for new solar PV system installations starting 2016. An open invitation to residents to join the SHHA group dinners, focusing on community togetherness rather than formality. A reminder about SHHA's office location on San Rafael Avenue, Albuquerque and the importance of observance of zoning regulations. The SHHA also outlined their operational procedures, including weekday office hours, provision of corporate tram passes and a range of benefits to be offered to their members. They also highlighted the role of Sandia Heights Services (SHS) in providing water, sewer, trash and recycling collection, as well as security services. They urged residents to maintain good relationships with neighbours and advised against improper trash can storage which violates Sandia Heights Covenants. The meeting ended with an open discussion on the community's objections to PNM's proposed price hikes and interconnection fees, the need to focus on landscape maintenance and weed control, and plans for the upcoming small group dinners.
