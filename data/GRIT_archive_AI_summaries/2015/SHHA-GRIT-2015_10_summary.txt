In September 2015, the SHHA held a meeting at St. Chad's Church to address several community topics: Safety concerns over drag racing were discussed, with members supporting Commissioner Lonnie Talbert's proposed changes to DWI ordinances. Updates were given on SHHA's services, such as online classified ads, the need for residents to deliver their bills to a specific SHHA office, and the requirement for updated information on pest control, septic tanks and appliance repairs. There's a reminder to utilize the security email alert system and to explore the Member Benefits Program on SHHA's website offering discounts from various local businesses. The importance of pedestrian safety was reiterated and a call for entries was made for a photo contest for the 2016 Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide. Information on PNM's rate hike request, covenant support and architectural control were given, whilst emphasis was also placed on maintaining neighborhood aesthetics by storing/disposing properly of trash cans. The real estate market status in Sandia Heights was detailed, with key information on property values and available homes for sale presented. Lastly, there was news of pending zoning change dispute with the Mhoon property, and upcoming community activities, with information about the office services available to SHHA members. The September 2015 meeting covered several issues, and its members optimism concerning the progression of the community was evident throughout the course of the meeting.
