The SHHA provides numerous benefits including tram passes to renters, as long as property owners maintain their membership, with the dues billed in the monthly utility. SHHA publishes a publication, The GRIT, for residents and pushes security vigilance amongst the neighborhood. A security email alert system supplements this. SHHA's Covenant Support Committee (CSC) maintains parking restrictions related to house trailers and recreational vehicles and encourages residents to adhere to strict property maintenance. The Parks & Safety Committee enforces leashing and cleanup of dogs, and the use of 'No Soliciting' signs. The Sandia Heights Services and Sandia Heights Security are separate entities that provide specific neighborhood services. During bear season, the association advises residents to store garbage cans inside, remove bird feeders from outdoor areas at night, and keep pets inside. Construction activities should be limited between 8 AM 6 PM on weekdays and Saturdays. Approved construction projects include door and window replacements and photovoltaic panel installations, amongst others. SHHA helps community members engage through international student hosting opportunities, an annual Studio Tour, and the "Cork & Fork" dining activity for couples and singles. A highlight is the annual photo contest for the 2016 Resident Directory & Guide, with the winning photo gracing the cover of the Guide. The contest is open to amateur photographers from the SHHA community but requires statements of originality and permission for SHHA use. Membership benefits by various merchants can be viewed on the Sandia Homeowners website.
