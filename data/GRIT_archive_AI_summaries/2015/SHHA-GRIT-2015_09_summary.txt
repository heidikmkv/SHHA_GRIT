The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA) provides several benefits and services to its members, such as: A platform for posting classified ads on its website and in GRIT, its publication. Discount programs with local businesses, including restaurants and service providers. Free corporate tram passes, contractor evaluations, and merchant discounts. The SHHA also recently announced a holiday from monthly dues for October and November due to increased revenues. Current non members are encouraged to avail of this offer and get two free months by signing up for a year long membership. For safety, the SHHA has issued advisories on bear sightings and tree maintenance; residents are advised to ensure that their trees, plants, and shrubs are not dying or dead to prevent fires and enhance property value. Besides, residents should ensure adherence to the Sandia Heights Unit Covenants. The homeowners association holds discussions on community aesthetics, enforcement of weed control, and upholding the natural look of Sandia Heights. It also offers updates on ongoing property projects on its website and provides emergency contacts and extra information, such as office hours and notary services. Policemen have attended a breadth of complaints, the most frequent being home burglary and wildlife reports. The Crime Prevention Unit extends advice on preventing residential burglary. Lastly, Panorama Homes Inc., under President John Lowe, applied for a zoning change request for the Mhoon property targeted towards residential constructions. The SHHA opposes this due to a similar attempt that was previously denied. Meanwhile, the Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour will occur on September 12 13, 2015, with a preparatory art gallery show. The SHHA office will be closed on September 7th in observance of Labor Day.
