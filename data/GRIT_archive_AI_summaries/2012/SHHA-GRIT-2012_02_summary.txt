Kate Fry, president of the SHHA, expresses her fondness for Sandia Heights and the respect for nature she shares with her neighbors. Dramatic landscapes, local wildlife, and well preserved architectural styles add to the charm of the tranquil location. A surprising occurrence is the recent sightings of mountain lions in the area, and for their safety, residents are guided on the SHHA website. Furthermore, the SHHA is digitizing older files, making four drawer filing cabinets available for sale to members. A slight increment in membership dues is announced due to the rising cost of expenses, but members benefit from facilitated admission to SHHA events, access to tram passes, and SHHA Merchant Benefits, amongst others. Advances in the photovoltaic (PV) industry are reported by the GRIT, including new methods of solar panel installation. While homeowners have the freedom to install solar panels, the GRIT recommends consulting the Approved Citizens Corporation (ACC) to limit negative visual impacts. The ACC Activity Log is accessible on the sandiahomeowners.org website for details on approved projects and processes. With reported mail theft, residents are urged to take necessary precautions. Ads for local businesses and information on community events, including meetings, are displayed on the association's website. A community group "Cork & Fork" invites interested couples, and residents are invited to the Sandia Heights Artists' fall studio tour and Ash Wednesday service arranged by the Church of the Good Shepherd.
