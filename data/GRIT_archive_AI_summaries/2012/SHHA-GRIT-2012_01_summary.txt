The SHHA is hosting a community concert featuring western band Syd Masters & the Swing Riders, with local artwork on display, and complimentary refreshments. The SHHA does not manage Sandia Heights Services but helps manage community activities and issues. This includes reminders about respecting local wildlife and their habitats, implementations for exterior housing modifications, and the increase of SHHA membership dues from $8.00 to $10.00 per month. They also tackle nuisance related concerns, such as noise, traffic, and rowdy behavior during summer concerts held by the County Line Restaurant. SHHA will now provide homeowner updates through the new online newsletter titled GRIT. Limited time offers like the 'IROOM Re DO' are available, offering 25% savings to members. Members can also avail of services like notary services, Sandia Peak Tram passes, and admission to concerts and supporting local stores. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) plans to begin electronic archiving of documents and adjusting application forms for both hard and digital copies. The community remembers former ACC member Terry Taggart for his contributions. Updates and notices such as meeting schedules, community events, and lost and founds are available on the SHHA website. Non members are encouraged to join the SHHA to enjoy these membership benefits.
