SHHA President, Kate Fry, urgently calls for volunteers to fill out positions on the SHHA board and its committees. The association faces potential dissolution due to a lack of board members, endangering the upcoming annual meeting slated for June 9. Notable updates include an upcoming website revamp offering user friendly design, easy navigation, more pictures, online forms for ACC projects, and complaints about covenant violation. The website will also feature more information about the local environment, events calendar, among others. There have been reports of issues related to coyote incidents involving loose pets and a update on the wastewater and septic systems. Residents have expressed concerns about an amendment concerning septic systems in Bernalillo County passed without public engagement. The homes provided by dedicated real estate professionals Sharon and Judson feature modern amenities with unique features such as gourmet country kitchens, multiple view decks, and in ground pools. In the face of increased costs, the SHHA has announced an increase in membership dues from $8.00 to $10.00 per month, effective March 1, 2012, to cover expenses like office rent, utilities, insurance costs, labor costs, and other benefits. Moreover, an announcement has also been made about community events such as the Sandia Heights Artists meet, the 9th annual Sandia Heights Art Tour, and the Church of the Good Shepherd Sunday Services. Residents are advised to prepare in advance for any construction or home improvement projects and submit their plans for the ACC's pre approval for smooth operations.
