The Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series is hosting a Steve Gillette and Cindy Mangsen concert on Saturday, September 8 at 7:30 p.m., at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Open to all ages and alcohol free, tickets range from $5 $15, with free entry for association members and their houseguests. SHHA President Ann Zimmerman highlights the importance of proper waste management, categorizing waste into recycled, green, biodegradable, hazardous, and bio medical waste. To protect local wildlife, residents should secure waste containers and avoid leaving waste out overnight. SHHA benefits include discounted local business rates, corporate tram passes, and access to crucial alerts via the E mail Alert Service. With printing costs increasing, GRIT publication will only be distributed to members who subscribe for $10 a month. Sandia Heights Services (SHS), separate from SHHA, offers water, sewer, trash, recycle collection, and security services. Their new trash bin program, available in September, allows customers to choose their desired bin size at no change fee. Special pick ups for excess trash or larger items can be scheduled for a minimum charge of $20. The community's recycling system has over 70% voluntary participation. For enquiries, reach out to the office via phone, email, or their website. All neighborhood project applications undergo a seven day review process by the ACC, allowing nearby residents to voice concerns. The ACC ensures all approved projects harmonize with the surroundings and do not disrupt the natural landscape. The text also includes a resident's anecdote about recovering a lost phone using the "Find My iPhone" app and the local sheriff's department. With bears often sighted in fall, residents are advised to secure food sources like garbage, fruit trees, and bird feeders. Only threatening bear activity should be reported to the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. SHHA introduces the online GRIT Newsletter as a free substitute for printed copies. Other SHHA events include a Model Railroad Open House and a photo contest, requiring entries to feature Sandia Heights.
