Professional real estate brokers, Linda Caldwell and Judson McCollum, have been praised for their understanding of the Sandia Heights area and their dedication to clients' needs.

Homeowners are encouraged to undertake projects like landscaping and window replacements. Exceptional community members like Max Sanchez, a successful realtor, Tim Porter, a retiring UPS driver, and Marie Wise, the 2013 Directory Photo Contest winner, are acknowledged.
