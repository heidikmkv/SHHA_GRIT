The SHHA uses its GRIT newsletter to communicate updates and information to residents. It's important to note that the SHHA is separate from the Sandia Heights Services, which handles local utilities. Key points in their latest updates include: The SHHA membership comes with benefits such as being able to receive the GRIT newsletter, six corporate tram passes daily, and membership cards offering discounts from local vendors. The SHHA office also maintains a security email alert system for members. A suggested amendment to Bernalillo County's Wastewater Ordinance, demanding inspection of septic systems older than 30 years on lots Â¾ acre or less, has been delayed until a September commission meeting. Renters in Sandia Heights can also enjoy SHHA benefits, minus voting privileges and filing covenant complaints, given the property owner maintains their SHHA membership. SHHA hosts periodic community events, like the Coffeehouse Concert series, and encourages members to participate in neighborhood activities for fostering neighborliness. SHHA provides local recycling guidelines for citizens to follow, explaining that except glass and Styrofoam, other recyclables should be placed loose in the green lid recycle bin, starting from September. Residents considering moving are recommended to reach out to Linda Caldwell, a real estate professional with experience in Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque. SHHA plans for a central sewer line are underway as a long term solution to septic system issues. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) has provided design guidelines to help residents in project planning for property modifications, maintaining Sandia Heights' natural aesthetic. SHHA hosts an annual photo contest for the Resident Directory & Guide open to members with entries due by November 2nd. The photos should be original, color images of the Sandia Heights area captured by amateur photographers.
