The Urban County Charter proposed by the Urban County Charter Commission for Bernalillo County has drawn criticism from both the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association and David Camptell, the Vice Chair of the commission, due to its lack of substantial reform towards a united city county government. Camptell further suggested the draft should be defeated in the December voting. Sandia Heights Residents, who contribute significantly in sales tax to Albuquerque without influence on the allocation or representation in determining local police leadership, could potentially benefit from city county government unification. Operational efforts by the homeowners association, including a focus on traffic safety, excessive speeding as per a county study, and a new complaint handling procedure accepting only signed written complaints from August 27th onward, attempt to address concerns in the community. Other initiatives include work on vegetation maintenance, utilization of a $20,000 Open Space reserve, and actions to tackle wildlife concerns. Residents are also receiving advice and guidelines to maintain safety and environmental balance, encouraging trash security against animals, proper yard maintenance, and secure home openings. In an effort to promote community engagement, the association's newsletter, The Grit, is open to suggestions and comments, with new SHIA members encouraged to offer feedback or even contribute by writing. Possible activities for attracting members include a craft fair, a film show, and an antique fair. Considering potential tram discounts and rewards for vandalism information are also in progress. Lastly, a musical event with the Albuquerque Baroque Players has been scheduled.
