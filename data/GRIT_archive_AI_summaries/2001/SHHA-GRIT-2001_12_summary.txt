Sandia Security has responded to a letter in the Grit publication, reaffirming its commitment to provide robust security services, with patrols covering approximately 47 miles and 59 passes by each resident's home every month. There's a new vehicle added and consistent personnel for patrolling, with a security mobile number readily available. A contract was entered with the High Desert Homeowners Association for extra patrol services. The newsletter also discusses a Settlement Agreement, granting Sandia Pueblo certain rights to a specified area for cultural purposes, with contingent public use provisions. Hunting regulations by the state and Forest Service remain unchanged. The notices section includes an invitation to Sandia Pueblo's "3 Kings Day" celebration and a Sandia Presbyterian Church meeting, a financial report, babysitting services, classified ads, contact information for Sandia Mountain Coalition and Sandia Pueblo supporters, available services and sympathy messages. The newsletter covers property tax reductions with homestead exemptions accessible at the County Assessor's office and veterans' allowances at the Veteran's Service Office in Santa Fe. Opportunities to get involved in community activities such as game nights, computer and Wildflower clubs, and SHHA committees are highlighted. The newsletter also serves as a platform for communal discussions over the Sandia Mountain dispute.
