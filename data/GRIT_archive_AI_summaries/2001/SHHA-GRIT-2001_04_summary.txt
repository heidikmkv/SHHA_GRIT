The SHHA Board has won a District Court case defending the Architectural Control Committee's (ACC) decision to deny a property extension, supporting the legally binding power of the ACC and the validity of the community's Restrictive Covenants. The Association has made several significant strides in the past year, such as opening an SHHA office, creating an annual budget, and broadening the distribution of its publication, "Fox Mat". However, they seek candidates to fill nine vacancies on their board, encouraging residents to get involved. Issues of concern include dogs running loose and speeding drivers, and residents are encouraged to report such problems for action. The Board keeps the community informed on financial standings, security issues, and standing and ad hoc committee updates. Future meetings include a discussion on the home rule and zoning amendment proposals. The Associations encourage participation in the Spring Litter Cleanup event scheduled for Saturday, April 28, while the Annual Meeting, detailing the year's events, will take place on Saturday, June 2nd at The Church of the Good Shepherd.
