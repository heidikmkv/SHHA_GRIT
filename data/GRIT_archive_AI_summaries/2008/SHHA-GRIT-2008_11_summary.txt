In the November 2008 newsletter, Sandia Heights Homeowners Association President Sy Caudill discusses the issue of obstructed views in the community due to excessively tall trees. He encourages residents to consider trimming or removing their taller trees. The newsletter also features Alyson Clark's focus on the importance of disaster preparedness which includes maintaining clear access for emergency services and installing carbon monoxide detectors, amongst others. Frances Desonier encourages more online engagement by asking homeowners to contribute personal photos. The newsletter also features letters to the editor tackling community issues. Past discussions are not revisited, and personal attacks are prohibited in order to maintain a civil dialogue. The Treasurer's report lists an income of $27,236.08 and expenses of $17,342.95 for September 2008, along with office notices, the County Planning Commission's recent approvals and disapprovals of home renovations and the GRIT's editorial policy. Other community news includes the successful Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series, a New Orleans Jambalaya and Jazz Fund Raising Dinner by the Church of the Good Shepherd in aid of Hurricane Katrina revival efforts, the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club upcoming meetings, and a 'Meet n Greet' event by the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association. An annual photo contest for the 2009 Sandia Heights Resident Directory is calling for entries exclusively from amateur photographers with photos fitting the cover composition. Photographs can be submitted in various formats, but must be accompanied by a statement confirming originality, the non professional status of the photographer, and SHHA's permission for photo use. The winner will have their photo feature on the cover of the directory, and receive recognition as the photographer. The deadline for submissions is November 15.
