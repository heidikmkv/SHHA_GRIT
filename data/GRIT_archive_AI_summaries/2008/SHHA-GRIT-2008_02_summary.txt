The Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association (SHHA) has reported several achievements such as successful rezoning projects and development of the free Tram Pass and free coffeehouses for members. In addition, the ACC and committees have ensured construction projects align with covenant requirements. Ongoing efforts are being made to revamp community signage and replace blue fire hydrant markers that were removed by snow plows last year. Meanwhile, members are encouraged to be vigilant with mail as theft is an ongoing issue. Financially, the association ended 2007 positively, with considerable help from the unspent Legal Reserves, and expressed optimism about increased membership revenues in 2008, which will be reinvested in the community. Residents are also encouraged to adequately water Pinon trees to prevent insect and disease damage during the severe drought. The SHHA seeks more community participation, particularly from women, parents of young children, and residents from unrepresented units. Contact Dick Cline at 856 1911 or the office at 797 7793 for more information. Corporate Tram Pass service is available for SHHA members and four passes will be distributed each day. The executive committee, led by Sy Caudill, Ed Tull, Larry Desonier, and Ed Whitten, also deals with community needs like solicitor issues, utility assistance, and emergency services. GRIT, an ACC activity log, provides information on several property modifications in Sandia Heights South. All are generally approved, with exceptions being additions or features that violate rules or disrupt neighborhood harmony. The 2008 directories have been mailed to members and the cover photo by Virginia Porterfield has been praised. Future community events include Sandia Heights Wildflower Club presentations and dinners, and a tribute event at Kirtland Air Force Base for military women. Open burning is prohibited by Sandia Heights covenants and all garbage must be appropriately discarded. Visit the SHHA website for complete covenants and additional resources and updates.
