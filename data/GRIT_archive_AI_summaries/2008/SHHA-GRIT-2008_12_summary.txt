The SHHA completed successful ventures in 2008, including those related to zoning, road resurfacing, and renovation applications, resulting in increased community involvement in covenant enforcement. These successes also included well attended Tram passes and open house presentations on fire prevention and solar power, as well as a recognition program for key contributors. Despite issues with volunteer resources, SHHA continues managing its operations, encouraging community involvement with several volunteer opportunities, including board of directorsâ€™ vacancies. The association is in a healthy fiscal state and anticipates increased community participation in the future. SHHA covers both Sandia Heights and High Desert housing communities, each with contrasting environments. Sandia Heights features large, picturesque rural settings with a 15 mph speed limit, while High Desert contains smaller urban lots with fast four lane roads and a speed limit of 35 mph. Both areas pose safety concerns due to residents sharing space with motorist traffic, which SHHA aims to mitigate through promoting safety measures and maintaining clear roads. SHHA also offers various amenities and services to its members, encourages non member participation, and hosts social events like the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series. The association keeps a keen eye on security and maintains processes for reporting suspicious activities. Denver based musicians Acoustic Eidolon will be performing in January 2009, as part of the Coffeehouse Concert Series. SHHA recommends supporting local services and businesses advertised in the GRIT newsletter, which is also accessible on their website. Sandia Heights' Architectural Control Committee (ACC) has a log of its approved home improvement projects on the SHHA website. It shares community events and advises on gardening practices. It strives to maintain the high standard for construction and landscaping, and disapproves projects that don't meet their standards.
