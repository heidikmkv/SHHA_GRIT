In March 2008, the SHHA held an Open House event, where the focus was on covenant enforcement by key committees, improving the website, addressing speeding concerns, and presenting the financial report, which showed an overall total of $85,782.31. The association urged for volunteer effort to preserve the community. Issues surrounding responsibility for damaged walls were clarified after legal consultation, which highlighted loopholes with New Mexico laws around common areas. Signs designating various units were proposed to be common areas under SHHA, with the cost delegated to relevant homeowners. Additionally, SHHA provides a security subscription service and encourages water bill monitoring for potential plumbing issues. It also organizes events to foster community spirit, implemented measures to maintain neighborhood aesthetics, and outlined benefits of the $8.00 membership fee. The community was also briefed on recycling options, updates to the county animal ordinance, and the necessity to report vandalism. Residents were reminded about pet ownership responsibilities, and various community events were announced.
