The SHHA works with the county on infrastructure improvements such as street paving, speed limits and traffic calming measures. Speed bumps, however, are a county issue with resident input. SHHA collaborates with the Parks and Safety Committee around speed limits and discourages single issue volunteering. Membership benefits include free Tram Passes, ACC requests, Covenant Support Committee actions, copy/notary services, contract reference database access, Coffee House series admission, and more. Non members pay when attending the coffee series. Communication can be made via official email or contact number. Construction near San Rafael reduces parking lot visibility and impedes walkway access, with the property owner agreeing to remove wind blockers. The treasurer's report of an unnamed organization shows a positive balance with inflows of $13,914.95 and outflows of $9,158.31. The association hosts free coffeehouse concerts, the MEET 'n' GREET event (where fire risk reduction discussions will take place), and a garden workshop with Bob Francis, alongside the 5th annual Artist Studio Tour. The Architectural Control Committee approves construction and repair projects based on meeting code requirements. Monthly data tracking of calls for suspicious behavior is emphasized. Volunteer needs range from patrols to working on the Resident Directory. The SHHA approved local projects including replacing HVAC equipment, mailboxes, and landscaping works. Tram service is provided free with a refundable $5 deposit. The community also hosts social events such as the 'Singles of Sandia Heights', church services, and SHHA held events, including a photo contest for the 2009 directory's cover image.
