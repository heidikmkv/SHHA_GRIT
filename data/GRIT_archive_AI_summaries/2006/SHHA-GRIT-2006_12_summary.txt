In December 2006, the SHHA revealed plans for community projects, calling for volunteers with construction, communication, internet, and website experience. During a Town Hall meeting, they debated on the proposed T Mobile cell tower, with the SHHA opposing the structure. The association announced their annual photo competition and a concert by Walt Michael, set for January. They encouraged residents to recycle and manage their waste responsibly, with SHHA Financial Summary no longer being part of The Grit, but can be provided upon request. Also, road re surfacing initiative along Tramway Blvd to decrease noise levels was to happen by June 30, 2007. With regard to maintenance, several streets were due for repavement, and residents were prompted to report if their streets require cleanup. J.E. Saenz is the featured security officer and several repair and replacement activities around Sandia Heights were outlined, with the Architectural Control Committee's approval where necessary. On community events, a dining activity reported a successful start to its second season, and more dinners were planned. Virginia Valentine, a local resident, was lauded for receiving the 2006 Distinguished Service Award from the American Association of Diabetes Educators. Finally, residents were reminded of property rights and the association wished everyone a "Merry Christmas," "Happy Hanukkah," and "Happy New Year."
