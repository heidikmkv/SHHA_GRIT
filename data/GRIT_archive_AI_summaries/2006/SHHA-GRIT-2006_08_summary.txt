The SHHA recently conducted their annual community picnic, featuring various activities, food provided by the association, and recycling efforts. Controversy arose over a proposed cell phone tower by T Mobile due to concerns about its height, leading to SHHA rescinding its initial support. Other community issues, like mandatory membership, nuisance animals, and speed traps are also being looked into by the association, including strategies for improving emergency and safety protocols. Notably, SHHA is discussing potential solutions like special trash pickups, noise ordinances, and enhancements to common areas and signs. They also advised residents to use landlines for 911 calls for accurate GPS coordinates. In terms of governance, the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) plays a vital role in approving and disapproving residential projects. Projects include things like fence replacements, addition of storage sheds, and new constructions. The ACC enforces covenant adherence and investigates any deviations and variances from its guidelines. Residents can follow ACC activities on SHHA's website. Community involvement is encouraged through various local groups, including playgroups, art networks, and book clubs. A recycling effort is in progress and obstacles courses are being planned for future events. Warnings have been issued to owners of unruly pets as well. SHHA is overseen by Vicki Criel, the Community Service and Membership Chairperson. The homeowners association has set operating hours and guidelines for trash disposal to prevent disruption by wildlife. Finally, upcoming events include a concert by the Celtic Coyotes at the Church of the Good Shepherd. The concert is set for August 5, 2006, with ticket pricing and raffle details disclosed by SHHA.
