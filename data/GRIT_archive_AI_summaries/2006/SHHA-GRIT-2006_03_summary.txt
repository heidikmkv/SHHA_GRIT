The SHHA is bustling with activities. The events include a concert by Vermont singer songwriter Lisa McCormick on April 29, a jazz night on March 18, a meeting for the Art Walk Committee on March 6, and an annual wine tasting event now scheduled for June. Social and networking events will be accompanied by refreshments. In terms of community improvements, the SHHA board has been lobbying for projects related to community safety and quality of life. Upcoming discussions include issues around speed humps and new wastewater systems following a recent County Waste Water Ordinance. Feedback from an Architectural Control Committee (ACC) questionnaire shows strong support for enforcement of building regulations within the community, despite some criticisms. The ACC activity log reveals various approved construction projects and cases of unauthorized construction since January 1, 2006. Moreover, the board constantly updates a log of security incidents and offers crime prevention tips, with most calls concerning vacationing homeowners. Any inquiries can be directed to Sandia Heights Security at 856 6347. The executive committee comprises President Ed Whitten, Vice President Thomas Coyne, Treasurer Dick Cline, Secretary Marsha Thole, and several board members who can be reached through the SHHA Office, located at 2 B San Rafael Ave, Albuquerque. Lastly, issues were noted in the January 2006 Directory of Residents, which erroneously implied all SHHA members receive security services. For corrections on directory information, residents are encouraged to contact SHHA and the classified ads are available on the association's website.
