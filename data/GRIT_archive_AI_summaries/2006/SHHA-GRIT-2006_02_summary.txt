Marsha Thole and Bobby Baker, the Bernalillo County Traffic Engineer, have been investigating the causes of lengthy wait times at local intersections. Key findings include a 90 second wait time during peak hours, with unused green light time being shifted to the main line, and potential issues with vehicle recognition from lack of detection cameras and sunlight glare. It was recommended that anyone experiencing traffic signal problems should contact Baker. Community news includes the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's (SHHA) call for volunteer support for administrative tasks, including website management, legal advice, and board representation. The group has also flagged a new wastewater ordinance aimed at resolving prior conflicts and bringing local laws into line with changes at the state level, with details on the rule changes for property improvements and community developments. A new walking path from Little Cloud Park has also been announced, representing the first stage of a broader network of trails. The SHHA is pushing for greater community involvement in capital improvement projects, with calls for volunteers to write proposals for traffic, safety, and parks projects. SHHA has clarified its position on street speed bumps by stating homeowners from the affected streets have complete control over whether speed humps are installed, with the county having clear guidelines for the installation process. Bernalillo County recently installed speed humps on Tramway Lane after residents' petitions, and the first Sandia Heights Coffeehouse at Church of the Good Shepherd was deemed a success with approximately 70 attendees. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) in Sandia Heights will be launching a new feature called GRIT to keep residents informed of local construction activities, while State Representative Kathy McCoy has highlighted issues expected in the upcoming legislative session, including the state budget. The Sandia Heights Security (SH Security) offers a response time averaging 2 4 minutes and logs for 2005 include attempts at burglaries and various disputes. However, membership to the SHHA doesn't guarantee services from SH Security, with homeowners encouraged to check their status on their monthly utility bill.
