Bob Thomas offers holiday safety tips such as respectful parking, proper inspections of electrical decorations, and outdoor plug protection for festive lights. The SHHA has launched a Welcoming Initiative to create stronger community bonds and security by reaching out to new residents with useful information and introducing Neighborhood Watch groups. Sandia Heights' spirited roadrunners provide entertainment and require caution around pools, while SHHA provides a range of paid services. Residents also have access to sale items from SHHA, including discounted tram passes and unique ACC Color Reference Guides. SHHA also promotes local deals from businesses like Abel Plumbing & Heating, Academy Mortgage, and Barnett Aldon Ironworks, and conducts tax related census ensuring no data scams. Ongoing area projects, property violation reports, and a summary of approved projects by SHHA can be also found on their website. SHHA supports community gatherings like the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Orchestra and Sandia Heights' "Cork & Fork" Dining Activity. An open invitation is extended to all for the Northeast Church of Christian worship and Bible studies. Check the SHHA website for any GRIT corrections and note their holiday closures.
