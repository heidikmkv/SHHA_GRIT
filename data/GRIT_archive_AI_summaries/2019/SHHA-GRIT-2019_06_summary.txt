The annual meeting of SHHA discussed potential enhancements to W.L. Jackson Park, including more shade, extra picnic tables and a splash pad. The Parks and Recreation Department plans to plant more shade trees, but a splash pad was deemed too expensive. In 2019, SHHA held a Fire Risk Management Seminar with advice from emergency services on pre fire evacuation plans. An Easter Egg Hunt organized by the CS&M committee delighted over 100 children and promoted community togetherness. The Sandia Heights Security has been responding to a variety of calls. The Neighborhood Watch scheme is thought to be effective, hence its endorsement at a community meeting and its signs being installed by SHHA. The ACC has advised property owners to review design plans before proceeding with their projects in order to adhere to guidelines and covenant restrictions. Several construction and restoration projects are underway in Sandia Heights, which are listed on the SHHA website. The Board of Directors is seeking new members. A number of community events are also being organised, including a Democratic Meet and Greet, Painting at Sunset, worship services, and Sandia Heights "Cork & Fork" Dining Activity. All changes and event information are relayed via the SHHA website.
