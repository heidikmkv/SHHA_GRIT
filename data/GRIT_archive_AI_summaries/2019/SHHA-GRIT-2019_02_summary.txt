The Sandia Heights area, monitored by the Bernalillo County Sheriff Office and Sandia Heights Security, encourages residents to establish strong neighbor relationships for safety. Important contacts for residents include 911 for emergencies, the Sheriff and Fire Departments at 798 7000, and Sandia Heights Security at 263 4654. The subscription based Security Patrol offers services such as alarm response, crime deterrent, and special watch for away residents. The SHHA offers various resources on their website, including meeting minutes, and member information updates. Property owners can retain their SHHA membership even while renting their properties. The Sandia Heights Residents Guide and Directory is considering implementing email addresses for enhanced communication based on residents' preferences, with an "opt in" or "opt out" option. However, social media plans have been set aside due to privacy concerns, though email alerts will increase and the SHHA website will be upgraded. In December 2018, Sandia Heights Security responded to 236 miscellaneous calls. Office hours are from 9 AM to 4 PM on weekdays, offering free services such as notary, faxing, and copying. Tram passes and safety vests are available for purchase at the SHHA office, alongside member benefits and discounts. A successful "Goatscaping" trial took place for wildfire reduction, with around 60 livestock grazing for three days. The ACC approved various projects using the NR process for keeping neighbors informed and seeking feedback. The NR has been key in assessing construction impacts and the ACC requests neighbors to review and comment on proposed blueprint designs and plans. Community activities are numerous and provided to keep residents updated, and the SHHA offices will be closed on February 18, 2019. Corrections to the GRIT version can be found on the SHHA website.
