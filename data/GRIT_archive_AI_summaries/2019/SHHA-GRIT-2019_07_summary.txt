The Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office, led by Capt. Broderick Sharp and Lt. Vance Lunsford, has initiated strategies to combat burglary in the Sandia Heights region, including the application of high resolution video security systems, getting familiar with neighbors, and promptly reporting suspicious activities. Proposed measures include mandatory participation in Sandia Heights Security, which, although a separate entity from the Homeowners Association, would enforce a $13 monthly security fee. Besides security, the community is also encouraged to adhere to covenants to maintain property aesthetics and values, and participate in the local FireWise programs, using grazing goats and sheep for vegetation management and fire reduction. Sandia Heights Service offers various community services, including water, sewer, trash collection, and security. The Security Patrol provides security stats and emergency contacts while the SHHA is seeking new board members. The community is warned about potential wildfires, barking dogs' disturbances, and the need to apply for alterations to property exteriors via the Architectural Control Committee (ACC). The ACC, which also advises residents on project rules and regulations, has provided logs of recent projects. There are also various community events to look forward to, including painting workshops, art tours, and church services. Corrections or updates to the printed GRIT are available on www.sandiahomeowners.org. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association will resume services from 9 am on July 5, post a closure on July 4 in observance of Independence Day.
