The 2018 annual meeting of the SHHA introduced a new, interactive approach where members voiced interests and concerns. SHHA proposed initiatives including a community survey to identify priorities, reestablishment of the Community Service & Membership Committee, and certification of the SHHA office staff as voter registrars before the 2018 election. Similarly, the association reported its covenant violation procedure, and its reception of hospitality discounts from participating merchants. The association also highlighted the new addition to the community, the Boese Brothers Brewpub and provided details on approved construction projects. SHHA aims at improving common areas and enforcing covenants regarding architecture and appearance of the development. The association announced collaboration with North Glenwood Hills associations for projects related to North Tramway Boulevard and an enhanced neighborhood coffee program for new residents. Lastly, the GRIT community announcement included events and opportunities like performances, the Cork & Fork dining activity, and the announcement of the SHHA office closure for Martin Luther King Jr Day.
