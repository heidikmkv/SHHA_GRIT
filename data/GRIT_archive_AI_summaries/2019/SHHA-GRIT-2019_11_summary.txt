The Quail Run Center has been sold, and the new owner will make several changes, including its renaming to Sandia Heights Village. Plans include a more upscale design, consistent painting, parking area repairs, landscape replacement, and new signage, while leaving the current ATM intact. The Architectural Control Committee of SHHA will help ensure successful refurbishment. SHHA observes stringent Bernalillo County Code related light pollution policies and recommends that heat should not drop below 55Â°F during winters to prevent pipe damage. Issues with 'bagworms' can be managed through bag handpicking or insecticide. Members can purchase tram passes for $6 or borrow an ACC Color Reference Guide at the SHHA Office. SHHA offers various merchant discounts and reports neighborhood activities, including the Sandia Heights dinner group, Cork & Fork, and open house events. The association currently leads multiple projects such as renovations and reroofing and has raised funds for the La Mesa Arts Academy through the Sandia Heights Art Tour. SHHA is also compiling the 2020 Resident Guide & Directory. They urge residents to make any necessary changes by the November 15 deadline. The SHHA office will close on November 11, and November 28 29 due to Veterans Day and Thanksgiving but will reopen afterward.
