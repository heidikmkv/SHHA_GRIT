During SHHA's Annual Meeting, accessibility to recreational trails through arroyos in Sandia Heights was discussed, amid concerns of trespassing on private properties. The parks and safety committee advised getting explicit permission from homeowners or using public routes. The CSC emphasised yard and landscape maintenance importance, particularly in zero lot line areas, and the need for weed control in warmer seasons. With evolving community demographics, property modifications such as living spaces additions, garage upgrades, and revised landscaping are growing, requiring community input and review to ensure they fit neighborhood's architectural harmony. Guidelines state walls or fences should be immediately next to buildings, no more than six feet high (except for special cases), harmony with residential exteriors, only 50% of total living space enclosed, with white or mismatched paint disallowed, and wire fencing prohibited. Community's operation details include Sandia Heights Security Patrol, which keeps records of calls in the area, and office hours, board meetings, service and merchandise availability, and Member Benefits Program that offers discounts at participating merchants. Local attractions include Elena Gallegos Open Space, which offers various amenities for outdoor activities. Construction work updates also include the nearing completion of a two story, 11,000 square foot restaurant on the tram former High Finance Restaurant site, slated to open in May. Other community events include weekly rehearsals by the UNM Health Sciences Center Orchestra, worship times at St. Chad's Episcopal Church, as well as its 'Cork & Fork' event, and calls for young singers by the New Mexico Symphonic Youth Chorus. The SHHA is also hosting an Easter Egg Hunt on April 20th in response to a survey indicating a desire for more children activities.
