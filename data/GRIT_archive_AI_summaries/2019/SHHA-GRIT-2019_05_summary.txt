At the SHHA Annual Meeting held on February 9, 2019, President Woody Farber discussed a successful goatscaping test project which used goats to clear dense vegetation and reduce fire risk in an eco friendly way. The project, funded by the Board with $1500, was flagged as a feasible method for homeowners to use in Sandia Heights. He reassured that no Board members owned property in the test area. In addition, the meeting covered safety measures and evacuation protocols endorsed by Albuquerque and Bernalillo County Fire & Rescue during the SHHA hosted March Fire Risk Management Seminars. The Sandia Heights Architectural Control Committee (ACC) advised maintaining natural vegetation where possible, but residents can remove dead trees or vegetation, potential fire hazards, if needed. During construction or renovations, the greenery disturbed must be replaced. Stan Hubbard, who took over the Outpost Ice Arena last August, inaugurates the New Mexico Ice Wolves and plans to reopen the renovated arena in May. The homeowner association presented recent reports of incidents in Sandia Heights, such as customer assist calls, attempted break ins, and suspicious persons. It provided emergency contact numbers and information on office hours, meeting times, and services offered by the SHHA. Suggestions on using lower K rating lights to control light pollution were given, requiring ACC approval for outdoor security lights. Lastly, the update finished with a round up of approved housing projects like HVAC replacements, driveway expansions, etc., and community events including an art tour, choir participation, and dining groups. The SHHA office will be closed on Memorial Day.
