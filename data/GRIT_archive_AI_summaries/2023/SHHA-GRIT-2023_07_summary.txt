The SHHA, based in Albuquerque, is guided by officers President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Hugh Prather, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp, as well as multiple committee heads including Susan McCasland (Communications), Elizabeth Edgren (Community Service), Kathleen McCaughey (Environment & Safety), Randy Tripp (Finance), Hugh Prather (Nominating), David Crossley (Architectural Control), and Bob Thomas (Covenant Support). The Covenant Support Committee recently enforced rules against room rentals in Sandia Heights, while the Environment & Safety Committee underlined the need for fire resistant roofing material such as concrete or clay tiles, PVC roofing, and others. A local initiative has seen residents create mini libraries for book exchanges, and the local artist Eric Guenette has been showcased for his work with discarded materials. A May 2023 report showed incidences ranging from theft to suspicious behavior, while updated office hours, emergency contacts, and member services were listed. The local artisan Mary Ellen Merrigan was profiled for her creative jewelry work, safety information for pets was shared, and a log of ACC approved upgrades and maintenance was shared, including roofing, landscaping and driveway extensions. Wildlife features highlighted local rodents' importance in the ecosystem and suggested ways to humanely manage pests. Geological features of the area, including the Sandia Granite dikes, were also detailed. Community events included a photo contest, Neighborhood Afternoon Out, Cork & Fork dining activity and the Sandia Heights Art Tour.
