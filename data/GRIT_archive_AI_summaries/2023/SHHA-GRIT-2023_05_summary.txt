The Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association (SHHA) is guided by President Roger Hagengruber, Vice President Hugh Prather, Secretary Martin Kirk, and Treasurer Randy Tripp, and includes board members David Crossley, Elizabeth Edgren, Fenton McCarthy, Susan McCasland, Kathleen McCaughey, Claudia Mitchell, Arthur Romero, and Bob Thomas. Various committee chairs oversee key areas, including architecture, community service, finance, and more. Operations are run by Lead Administrator Patricia "Trish" Lovato and Administrator Angela Moreno out of the SHHA office in Albuquerque, NM, with office hours Monday to Friday. Key points: SHHA seeks additional board members to represent younger demographics; interested parties should contact Hugh Prather. SHHA recently conducted a workshop about wildfire safety and prevention; residents are advised to prepare for possible evacuation and create defensible spaces around homes. Residents are reminded of noise regulations related to pet disturbance and urged to observe safety matters including wildlife feeding laws. The Board Meeting will take place on May 10, 2023, and services like notary, faxing, and copies are offered to members. Sandia Heights residents are encouraged to carry out summer home maintenance and asked to join the Homeowners Association. The community enjoys various benefits such as discounts from local merchants, an annual photography competition, and geological highlights like the Sandia Granite. Community events are upcoming, like the SHHA Board & Committee Service Q&A, Sandia Heights "Cork & Fork" dining activity, and Sandia Heights Air Tour. Please note: The SHHA office will be closed for Memorial Day on May 29, 2023.
