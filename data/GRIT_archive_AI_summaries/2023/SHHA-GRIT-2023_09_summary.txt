The SHHA committee, chaired by Phil Krehbiel, Arthur Romero, Susan McCasland, Elizabeth Edgren, Kathleen McCaughey, Randy Tripp, and Hugh Prather, say goodbye to Angela Moreno from office staff. Angela is moving on to Sandia National Laboratories and is also known for her side career as a baker. SHHA emphasizes bear sightings and the importance of homeowners securing their garbage and adhering to their covenants to avoid penalties. The association encourages homeowners to use contractor evaluation binders, which include feedback and ratings on service providers from multiple fields. They also must submit committee approved ACC applications for external projects. The upcoming Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour will feature artists Collin Delker and Mara Malnekoff. Collin uses his electrical engineering background to create unique fractal artwork, showcased for the first time at the 2021 Sandia Heights Artists Tour. Mara creates wearable art through clothing. GRIT documents the community's various approved projects, including driveway replacements and HVAC installations. More details about these projects can be found on the Sandia Homeowners website. SHHA offers member benefits, such as discounts at several participating merchants. The text details the geological history of the Sandia mountains and how calcium carbonate layers formed over time, creating limestone cliffs. It warns against poisoned rodent traps, which could harm the broader ecosystem. Instead, homeowners should maintain cleanliness and use safe trapping methods. It also calls for residents to verify their listings in the Resident Guide and Directory by November 3rd, 2023. The text also discusses Bernalillo County Codes and Ordinances and urges homeowners to refer to these when necessary. The SHHA has resumed its “Cork & Fork” dining activity and is preparing for the 20th Annual Sandia Heights Studio Art Tour. It also announces an annual photography contest where the entry work must be an original piece from the entrant. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association office will be closed on September 4th in observance of Labor Day.
