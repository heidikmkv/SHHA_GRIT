They focus on covenant violations, primarily addressing them when a formal complaint is lodged. Their regulations extend to areas like tree removal rules, RV storage regulations, and specific rules about drone usage, having no specific covenants but following federal, state and local laws. The SHHA does not include utilities and security services, but provides notary services, copies, email alerts and contractor evaluation search among others.
