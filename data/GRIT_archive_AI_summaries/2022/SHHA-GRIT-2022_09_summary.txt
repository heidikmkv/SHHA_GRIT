The Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association (SHHA) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, overseen by officers, board members, office staff, and community committee members, is currently looking for new Board of Directors members as several terms are due to expire. This board represents the community's interests with minimum 11 members for operation, but eligibility includes being a Sandia Heights property owner with paid SHHA membership dues and capable of upholding Bylaws. Additionally, SHHA offers community services, assistance in connecting members with shared interests, and resources like notary services, information alerts, and access to various free services including voter registration and meeting dates. Safety vests and tram passes are also available for purchase to members. SHHA residents are also tackling the increasing tumbleweed problem, an invasive species harmful to garden crops and posing wildfire risks, and are encouraged to handle their removal through mechanical means before they mature and spread seeds. Also, the local government, Bernalillo County, advises residents to maintain weed growth on their properties and refrains from chemical usage. SHHA offers benefits including hummingbird attractions, access to approved project data including construction and landscaping, discounts from various merchants, and guidance on "xeriscaping," a water efficient landscaping practice. The association's website, www.sandiahomeowners.org, offers a variety of benefits to SHHA members. The community also welcomes residents to the 19th Annual Sandia Heights Artists Studio Tour due on September 17 18 and urges them to participate in a neighbourhood cleanup event, and the annual photo contest for the 2023 Sandia Heights Resident Guide and Directory, ending November 4. Lastly, residents are reminded not to feed wild animals, to maintain neighborhood aesthetics and safety, and to review subdivision covenants to safeguard against potential issues.
