The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association (SHHA), established nearly five decades ago, oversees covenants established by the Sandia Heights Sandia Peak Tram Company to preserve the quality of life and natural environment of the area. This non profit manages its duties through volunteers and applies 38 distinct covenants to various spaces within its jurisdiction. Key points include: An urgent call is in place for volunteers to serve on the SHHA board and committees, especially in the wake of potential legal infringements by the City of Albuquerque over the Elena Gallegos Open Space (EGOS). The November 2022's Grit document outlines several community updates, such as calls for volunteers, reported power outages, the announcement of a board meeting, and free services available to members. The New Mexico's pi√±on pine, a critical part of the local ecosystem and culture, is increasingly threatened due to climate change. Homeowners are advised on how to weatherproof their pipes ahead of the fast approaching winter season. A fascinating article on the historic KiMo Theater illuminates its architectural beauty, the presence of Swastika symbols, and stories of a ghostly presence in the form of a boy named Bobby and a bonnet clad woman. Finally, SHHA welcomes amateur photographers to take part in the annual photo contest, with community events and upcoming SHHA office closures also announced.
