An initiative to maintain environmental stewardship is in place targeting invasive Siberian Elms. Young trees are encouraged to be removed, while mature ones due to cost implications are not mandated for removal. A recent eco friendly initiative, the Little Green Bucket service, helps residents compost their garbage and food scraps. SHHA members can gain valuable information through the association's official website, including board meeting schedules, classified ad rules, and tram pass details. The association has initiated a program to list Little Libraries, suggesting residents to chip in with any information they have.
