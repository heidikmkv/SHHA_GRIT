The SHHA will host a Family Movie Night on Saturday, July 9th, 2011 at Jackson Park. Members and their families can get free swim and tennis passes, among many other benefits that SHHA offers. SHHA president Kate Fry thanked everyone involved in the Annual Meeting held on June 11th, while encouraging members to consider volunteering for SHHA committees or for the Board. Benefits for SHHA members include office and notary services, Sandia Tram passes, discounts at local businesses under the SHHA Merchant Benefits Program, and more. Contact SHHA for any inquiries about corporate tram pass details. The Sheriffâ€™s Department will ensure recreational and traffic safety and has suggested joggers and pedestrians carry ID and emergency contact information. Additionally, the SHHA office staff and officers are available to assist the community while respecting privacy. SHHA is working with county officials to control the noise during County Line Concerts. Any confusion regarding a potential noise ordinance was due to errors on the Bernalillo County office's part and did not represent an attempt to pass the ordinance stealthily. The University of New Mexico Hospitals (UNMH) is the state's largest academic health complex and is committed to enhancing community care. For more information, contact mpsalaz@salud.unm.edu. Further discussions tackle the proliferation of Siberian elms and the issue of bears post hibernation wandering into neighborhoods. Residents are instructed properly to manage garbage and food sources, and a summary of approved projects is provided. Updates on Portable On Demand Storage (PODS) containers policy amendments and its management procedure by the Architectural Control Committee (ACC). Lastly, members are invited to participate in the annual photo contest for the 2012 Resident Directory & Guide. Submissions must be original, taken by amateur photographers, relate to the Sandia Heights area, and delivered by November 4.
