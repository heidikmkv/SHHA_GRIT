The SHHA is hosting the award winning bluegrass band, The Chapmans, on January 15, 2011 at the Church of Good Shepherd. The alcohol free, all ages event offers free admission for members and houseguests, with a fee for the general public. Successes of recent SHHA events and initiatives—including the Meet and Greet with Santa and a community wide curbside recycling program—were recounted by SHHA President Phyllis Moore. Membership in the SHHA offers various benefits like free passes for the Four Seasons Club facilities, office and notary services, community event admissions, and participation in a Tree Lottery for tree removal. The association encourages non members to join and avail of these exclusive benefits. In tandem with the SHHA, Ace Hardware stores are collecting holiday lights for recycling to benefit children with cancer through the nonprofit Lights For Life. The goal for this year is to collect 21 tons of lights. Information about ongoing ACC projects, special deals, upcoming events, and SHHA updates can be found at sandiahomeowners.org, which now features a picturesque photo collection featuring work by Kate Fry among others. It's important to note that while GRIT mail is sent to both members and non members, the benefits provided by the association are exclusively for members. Joining SHHA opens up a host of benefits and community support.
