Community awareness is emphasized, with updates given through the GRIT newsletter and SHHA website. A noise ordinance hearing is set for February 8. Meanwhile, the search for volunteers and board members for next year is underway. As perks rise for SHHA members, such as free passes to tennis and swimming facilities, the Asian Cafe joins businesses offering discounts. The community bids farewell to active board member Mike Winokur. Tree removal lottery applications are being accepted, featuring free tree removal for eligible trees. Successful community events like meeting Santa and the Coffeehouse Concert are anticipated to return. The SHHA also addresses heightened security concerns and frozen pipe issues, proposing several cost effective solutions. Covenant support remains a priority for the SHHA, as it assists homeowners in compliance and communication. Members are reminded to notify the ACC of home improvements altering exterior appearances. Lastly, Sandia Heights' artists look forward to the September Tour of Artists, with meetings and preparations underway for the event, including helping hands requested for tasks such as mailings and signs.
