In April 2011, several activities and initiatives took place in the SHHA community: A coffeehouse concert was held, featuring artists Stephanie Bettman and Luke Halpin who showcased a mix of folk, bluegrass, and Americana music. The event also displayed artworks from the Sandia Heights Art Association. The Homeowners Association President at the time, Phyllis Moore, stepped down and was succeeded by the Vice President. The Sanitation Department offered free green waste pickup for a week. A new Merchant Benefit Partner, Los Equipales Restaurant, was introduced. Proposed amendments to the bylaws were due for a vote in the June annual meeting. The first ever Easter Egg Hunt took place at the WL Jackson Park. The SHHA appealed to members to replace retiring board members and volunteer for committees. The SHHA Tree Lottery initiative was announced, which aims to assist members with removal of overgrown trees. The SHHA provided several benefits to its members, including discounts from local businesses but faced an issue with the Septic Tank Ordinance compliance. ACC Activity Log was released with an overview of approved projects. Sandia Heights Artists announced its 2011 Studio Tour. Support services were offered to individuals affected by cancer via Cancer SOS and Sandia Presbyterian Church. SHHA annual meeting for its members was scheduled for June 11, 2011.
