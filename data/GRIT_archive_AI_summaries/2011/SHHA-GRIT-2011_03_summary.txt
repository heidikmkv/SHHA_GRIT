In 2011, the SHHA hosted a meeting with District 4 County Commissioner Michael Wiener focusing on county summer concerts, a proposed Noise Ordinance, and its effects on Sandia Heights residents. Further discussions were also held concerning the excessive motorcycle noise and racing on Tramway Blvd and the proposed increase in Sheriff surveillance. There were ongoing administrative changes with the search for new officers for the SHHA board and potential amendments to the SHHA bylaws. Community events were flourishing with the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert Series presenting Stephanie Bettman & Luke Halpin and the launch of the SHHA Tree Lottery. Moreover: SHHA members were offered free facilities at the Sandia Heights Four Seasons Club and a special merchant benefits program. Bernalillo County was grappling with the management of their detention center, ethics ordinance, and balance of the budget. Conversations regarding the County Line Restaurant transformed towards the possibility of Bernalillo County buying the restaurant to convert into a community center. Controversy arose surrounding sewer/septic tank regulations, with the SHHA organizing a discussion with Commissioner Michael Wiener and other officials. The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) was approving home improvement projects and considering covenant variances. The Church of the Good Shepherd was inviting teenagers to their teen program, and the Sandia Presbyterian Church (SPC) collaborated with Cancer Survivors Offering Support (Cancer SOS) to offer free support groups for cancer patients and caregivers. Finally, the Sandia Heights Artists group was planning their 2011 Studio Tour for local artists and issuing reminders about Daylight Saving Time. Despite these many activities and changes, the community was encouraged to voice their concerns and suggestions towards fostering a vibrant, inclusive, and thriving neighborhood.
