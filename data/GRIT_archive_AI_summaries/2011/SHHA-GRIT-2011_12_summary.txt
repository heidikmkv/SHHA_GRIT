Realtors Sharon and Judson specialize in selling homes quickly in Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres by offering comprehensive and aggressive real estate marketing. The Wastewater and Septic System Committee (WW&SSC) successfully influenced the repeal of a county ordinance requiring septic system upgrade, and continues to work hard to ensure fair treatment for Sandia Heights residents in this regard. Septic system maintenance guidelines and precautionary measures for winter have been provided to residents to avoid costly repairs and upgrades. Several home improvements are underway in the neighborhood, in addition to the completion of the electronic archiving by SHHA of all ACC residential files. Important note: from January 2012, ACC application will require both physical and digital copies. The SHHA has expressed appreciation to residents for their active participation in local events and commitment to maintain the desirability of the Sandia Heights neighborhood. Updates on SHHA office hours, holiday closures, free services to members, and additional announcements have also been released.
