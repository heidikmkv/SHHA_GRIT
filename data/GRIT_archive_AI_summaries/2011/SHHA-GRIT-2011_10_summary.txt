In her October 2011 message, Kate Fry, President of the Sandia Heights Homeowners Association, highlighted community cooperation issues. She discussed the challenges facing the local bear population due to harsh weather, urging residents to educate neighbors on cohabitation. Fry also clarified that formal written complaints are required for the Covenant Support Committee to act on violations. She praised the community's successful recycling program, which is now free of charge thanks to Sandia Heights Services, and advocated for more participation and a switch to weekly pickups. She also announced an upcoming 'Meet 'N' Greet' with author Dr. Richard E. Peck. She pointed out Albuquerque’s legal prohibition of unwelcome solicitors but stressed the absence of such ordinances on County roadways. Sandia Heights Homeowners Association offers benefits like free tennis/tram passes and various discounts at local businesses. Residents were reminded to be considerate pet owners, collecting their pets' waste. A local business called “Exterior Painting” offered home improvement services, including heating, cooling, and plumbing, with quick completion times and high quality outcomes. The July 2010 edition of "The Grit" emphasized the importance of homeowners engaging with the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) for all home improvements, even minor adjustments. The ACC has several renovation and maintenance projects planned, including window and door replacements, gutters, and restucco installations. The ACC has also started electronic file archiving, saving the community over $15,000. The SHHA offers member benefits, including access to fax and notary services, free contractor evaluation guides, and special activities like group dinners and playdates for young children. They also have a photography contest, urging amateur members to submit photos featuring Sandia Heights. The images must fit the cover size, be in color, and are to be sent to sandiaheights@comcast.net with a statement affirming amateur status and allowing SHHA to publish their photos. These photos may be used in the Directory or on their website.
