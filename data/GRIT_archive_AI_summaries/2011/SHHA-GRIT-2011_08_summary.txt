In August 2011, Kate Fry, in her President's Message, praised Sandia Heights residents for their successful fire prevention efforts over the 4th of July weekend, amidst extreme drought conditions. She warned residents about increased wildlife activity due to a shortage of food sources caused by the extreme weather. Fry updated residents on the County's monitoring of noise levels at outdoor concerts at the County Line Restaurant, thanks to Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's (SHHA) efforts. She reminded members about the range of services that membership in SHHA offers and the importance of maintaining membership even when renting out their homes. An emphasis was made on proper sign displays to deter unwanted solicitors. Family Movie Night was canceled due to poor air quality. Access to a maximum of 6 corporate TRAM passes was made available for members. SHHA extended an invitation for free swim and tennis passes to its members and guests. Information on property remodeling and local market updates were provided by The Grit, with a spotlight on Sharon and Judson McColl's contributions in the real estate sector. Residents were cautioned against hiring unlicensed and uninsured contractors, as they could become a liability. Several home improvement projects were happening, managed by ACC, with community guidelines about pet cleanup practices shared. Additionally, there were summer events at Elena Gallegos Picnic Area, a Sandia Heights Art Tour, and a photo contest open to Sandia Heights residents, with the winning photo to feature on the cover of the 2012 Sandia Heights Resident Directory & Guide. The guide would be available for collection from the SHHA office post publication. Finally, it was mentioned that physical copies of the said directory might have been distributed via mail, paid under presorted standard postage with the permit number 375, from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
