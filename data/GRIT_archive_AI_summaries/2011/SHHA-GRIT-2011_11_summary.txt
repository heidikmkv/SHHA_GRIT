Kate Fry, SHHA President, lauds Sandia Heights' beautiful landscape, committed directors and committees, while also calling for more volunteers and board members to maintain community qualities. Invitations for open positions and committee memberships are open to residents, who are also encouraged to contribute in keeping their environment unique and appealing. The community suffers from frequent mail misdeliveries due to confusing addressing; proponents suggest personally delivering misplaced mail and not leaving it in USPS property mailboxes to prevent confusion and potential theft. SHHA members enjoy multiple benefits, from office services to special discounts at local businesses. SHHA hosts numerous community events like movie nights and Santa meet and greets for member families at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Betsy Rodriguez and Sheraz Saint Lôt are a part of the diverse office staff. Sandia Heights Security Patrol operates independently, maintaining security in the neighborhood; security notices and announcements are provided via email and the ‘GRIT’ newsletter. The newsletter frequently covers aspects of building in Sandia Heights, including a standout issue on white roof usage (energy reduction), which faces restrictions to avoid impacting neighboring properties. ACC oversight suggests using low gloss, tan, matte finish materials. Numerous projects from stucco work to landscaping are under ACC management; details can be found on the registered website. ACC's electronic archiving has saved the community considerable funds, though large plans yet to be picked by homeowners by Jan 31, 2012, will be discarded. Members have various benefits such as notary services & directory guides. Discounts with cooperators, free passes to events & facilities, and community updates are available for the $8 monthly dues incorporated into water bills. SHHA office, open Monday Friday (9am 4pm), will be closed for Thanksgiving (Nov 24 & 25), with a scheduled Board meeting on Nov 9.
