A plague outbreak in Santa Heights has led to the discovery of infected animals and closure of the Elena Gallegos Picnic area. The Sandia Heights Homeowner's Association (SHHA) introduced a 1983 edition t shirt at its successful Spring Fling event and announced changes in their newsletter format for cost efficiency. They also advised homeowners of service updates including stopped collection on Labor Day and upcoming Holiday Bazaar scheduled for October. Upgrades in local phone system by US WEST, despite initial concerns, will improve service quality, and the expected changes will be updated on the directory for free. A security report encouraged vigilance and adherence to community security practices. The association has been successful in dealing with legal and zoning issues, as well as managing architecture reviews, advocating for local issues like commercial trucking and proper waste management. The community services initiative has been successful with recycling and support programs for the aged. Ongoing challenges include managing new regulations on septic tanks, absent local park legislation, and the new Tramway Improvement Project, which promises to bring commercial and recreational improvements to the area. The SHHA committees, led by volunteers, have been instrumental in securing these improvements. Classified ads and public notifications, which cover various services and events, were also part of community communication. The Sandia Heights Wildflower Club hosted a community picnic, with due payments directed to Mary Aan Sproid roaster, and another potluck event planned for September 15. SHHA committee and community members are urged to continually get involved in policy formulation and regulation guided development in the area.
