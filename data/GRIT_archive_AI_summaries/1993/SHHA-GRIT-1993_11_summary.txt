Last month, Evelyn Patten was appointed the new administrative assistant for the SHHA following a thorough search. With experience in management and real estate, she brings a wealth of expertise and is also supported by her family company, Patten International. At the SHHA Board of Directors meeting held on October 13, Evelyn received a warm welcome, with the board expressing confidence in her abilities. There have been incidents of vandalism in the Sandia Heights community involving damages to mailboxes, house lights, and home windows. The SHHA and Sheriff's Office encourage residents with information to report these instances and promote neighborhood watch programs for prevention. The community newsletter "The Grit" will adopt a new format starting February, after a delay due to staff changes. Major events include the state political races for House seats and Statewide positions next year, with community involvement strongly urged. With experience in various technical and managerial roles, Richard Krumbein steps in as the new chairman of the Architectural Review Committee, replacing Bill Stabler. Various services offered include fine custom framing and art services by Ramway, comprehensive eye care by John J. Teahan, M.D., dog dipping services by PETSMART and Bernallilo County Environmental Health Department, and a private mailbox rental service offering added amenities. In real estate, Pat Lenzer offers personal advice for buyers and sellers, while Max Sanchez and Sharon McCollum stand out for their high volume sales. In the community, a variety of individuals offer services like babysitting, pet care, and house sitting. Major events include a Christmas shopping event, bridge games, and Albuquerque/Bernalillo County League of Women Voters meetings. Volunteer opportunities are also on offer, such as reading for Newsline for the Blind and participating in the Junior League of Albuquerque. Finally, community residents are opposed to a Circle K convenience store obtaining a liquor license, a decision that was upheld by a hearing officer on September 23.
