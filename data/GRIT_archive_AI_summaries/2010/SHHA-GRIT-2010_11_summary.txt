In November 2010, Sandia Heights Homeowners Association's (SHHA) President, Phyllis Moore, reflected on several community updates: Moore addressed plans to work with Commissioner Wiener on new county wastewater regulations and the potential installation of sewer lines in Sandia Heights. She also discussed the issue of roadside vegetation in Sandia Heights, encouraging property owners to maintain county right of ways and address vegetation for pedestrian safety and aesthetic appeal. The SHHA Board of Directors reintroduced the Tree Lottery, offering coverage for tree removal costs for members to enhance mountain and valley views. Top real estate professionals Michelle Davis and Max Sanchez were recognized for their roles in selling properties in Sandia Heights. The Sandia Heights community was also reminded of: Established covenants to maintain property value and integrity, overseen by the ACC and CSC committees. The need for addressing occasional covenant violations, with possible legal involvement. The benefits of SHHA membership, including Office and notary services, annual classified ads, and discounts. Further notices included: The booking of holiday celebrations, consideration of the county ordinance about waste removal, and neighborhood project approval announcements. Different maintenance tasks being performed in the neighborhood, from roof replacements, driveway repaving, to window replacements, and restuccoing tasks. An amateur photography submission event for Sandia Heights residences. Lastly, she expressed her condolences for the loss of Richard Abruzzo, the Sandia Heights Services President.
