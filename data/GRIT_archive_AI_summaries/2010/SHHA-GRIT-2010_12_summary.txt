The Sandia Heights Homeownerâ€™s Association (SHHA) is organizing multiple events for its community, including a "Meet and Greet with Santa" on December 11, 2010, and the Sandia Heights Coffeehouse Concert series featuring The Chapmans on January 15, 2011. SHHA members benefit from free tennis and swimming passes at the Sandia Heights Four Seasons Club, tram passes, and discounts from local businesses via the Merchant Benefits Program. An ad hoc committee, led by Bob Francis, is currently addressing wastewater and septic tank issues in compliance with county regulations. Residents need to be vigilant with potential changes in county amplified sound/noise ordinance, Section 30 125. A proposed change could increase permitted sound levels to 75 decibels and allow concerts three times a week, with concerns related to increased noise and activity levels. A vote on this will occur on December 14. A resident's fall due to a dog off a leash signals the need for increased empathy and response to emergencies within the community. Meanwhile, SHHA encourages residents to switch to the online GRIT newsletter to reduce paper use and curb mail theft by using a P.O. Box for receiving mail. Community adherence to outdoor lighting ordinances is necessary to maintain enjoyment of property and night sky. Voluntary Emergency Response Team (CERT) provides disaster preparedness and response skills. Hiring licensed and insured contractors for home remodeling is recommended to avoid subpar work and high repair costs. The Association extends holiday wishes, with the office's closure from December 23, re opening on January 3, and several festive events being organized. Association's mailing of holiday greetings promotes communication and connection within the community. Inherent in all updates is the commitment of the SHHA to bolster community spirit, ensure security and adherence to local laws, and facilitate a high quality of life for the community. They additionally remind everyone to utilize their website for more information and updates.
