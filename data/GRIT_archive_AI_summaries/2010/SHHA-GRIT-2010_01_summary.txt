The SHHA in the January 2010 edition alerted residents about concerns such as trespassing bow hunters, mail theft, and special guidelines for installing energy saving roofs. A resident had encountered unauthorized bow hunters on her property, which prompted the SHHA to advise residents on seeking written consent from landowners before allowing hunters to traverse private lands to access public lands. Widespread mail theft prompted a call to secure outgoing mail by taking it directly to the post office and storing important documents in secure locations. An uptick in installations of energy saving "cool roofs" required the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to remind residents that white roofs are not allowed, due to covenant restrictions. Guidelines recommend a Solar Reflectance (SR) or Light Reflectance Value (LRV) below 65 and outside wall materials must harmonize with the overall building design. In addition, it was announced how SHHA members could benefit from daily tram passes, office and notary services, discounted safety vests and more. The SHHA emphasized that the Sandia Heights Security (SHS) is separate from the SHHA and informed residents about safety measures during bad weather, including pedestrians walking facing traffic. Advertisements included a feature from real estate agent Max Sanchez, an upcoming performance from Syd Masters & the Swing Riders, and an overview of approved ACC projects. Information was also shared about a Tree Removal Lottery, office closures for MLK Jr. Day and President's Day, and a meet and greet event at the SHHA office. The Association thanked everyone for photo submissions for the 2010 Directory and urged non members to join the SHHA to access exclusive benefits.
