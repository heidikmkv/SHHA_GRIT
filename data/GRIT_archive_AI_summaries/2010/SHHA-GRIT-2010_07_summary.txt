Phyllis Moore, the new president of the SHHA, has expressed gratitude to the attendees of the latest annual meeting and town hall event, where numerous objectives were achieved. The SHHA Board of Directors now includes Ana Acosta, Sandra Brown, George Connor, and Sarah Pirkl, along with Kate Fry as Vice President, Ed Tull as Treasurer, and Michele Munson as Secretary. Still, the Association requires additional volunteers for various committees, such as the Community Service & Membership Committee, Covenant Support Committee, and Communication & Publications Committee. The SHHA has significantly worked towards dealing with noise complaints and other local issues and has also encouraged homeowners to submit complete applications for exterior modifications to the Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to avoid delays. Homeowners are urged to plan and submit their projects ahead of time for review by the ACC to maintain covenant compliance. SHHA offers many benefits like free ACC applications, annual classified ads, and merchant discounts. Moreover, SHHA provides corporate tram passes, hosts a Coffeehouse Concert Series, and implements safety measures for Sandia Heights Services subscribers. Several amenities, including moving assistance, kitchen updates, and attractive stucco and window combinations, are available with added discounts. The community is encouraged to be responsible towards local wildlife, like summer emerging bears, by securing garbage and managing bird feeders. In the recent ACC activity log, many home renovations have been approved, all listed on the SHHA website. Local Albuquerque Real Estate agents Sharon & Judson McCollum are prepared to help sell Sandia Heights properties. Upcoming events include a Vacation Bible School, the Garden Tour, and the Sandia Heights Studio Tour. For the 2021 Sandia Heights Resident Directory, SHHA is holding a photography contest, open to all amateur photographer members with the aim of using the winning photo for the directory cover. Lastly, the note is stamped and ready for USPS shipping, with presorted standard U.S. postage paid in Albuquerque, NM.
