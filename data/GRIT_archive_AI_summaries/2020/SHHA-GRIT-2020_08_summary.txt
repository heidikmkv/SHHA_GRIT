The Sandia Homeowners Association (SHHA), based in Albuquerque, is overseen by president Woody Farber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Travis Rich, and Treasurer Cheryl Iverson, among a board of 15 members. The Association has highlighted developments regarding COVID 19 impacts on their operations, with neighborhood reviews being done differently but administrative abilities intact. The necessity of self care is strongly emphasized in an offered essay by Ruth Baird Pollard on confronting dementia. The Association has issued guidelines on peaceful coexistence with local wildlife due to increased reports of bear sightings and snakes. Furthermore, tips on dealing with snake encounters are outlined. Amid the pandemic, the SHHA office now reopened functions with new measures. The SHHA notes that approved home improvement projects continue and SHHA services, including emergency numbers for utility services, are provided to all members. Important community events such as the annual photo contest and the anticipated Grit Journal contributions are being managed, while the Sandia Peak Tram operations have been adapted for safety and health concerns. However, several activities including the Art Tour by Sandia Heights Artists and Sandia Heights "Cork & Fork" dining activities have been postponed or cancelled due to COVID 19. SHHA encourages new members and offers corrections from the written versions of the GRIT on their official website.
