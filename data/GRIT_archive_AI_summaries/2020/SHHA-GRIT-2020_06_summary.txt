In response to Coronavirus updates in mid May, Governor Lujan Grisham has permitted some easing of restrictions and a gradual reopening of businesses, including the SHHA office on May 20th while maintaining social distancing norms and hygiene practices. SHHA board members continue to oversee responsibilities assigned in 1995 by the Sandia Peak Tram Company's Architectural Control Committee with operational hours falling between Monday to Friday. In compliance with New Mexico law, property sellers should provide complete disclosures of their property, including any relevant covenants, to prospective buyers prior to concluding the sale. The seller's obligation to disclose SHHA Covenants and community documents is crucial as all Sandia Heights homeowners are bound by them. This disclosure includes community pedestrian safety guidelines for activities such as walking dogs, maintaining visibility, avoiding distractions, and staying alert for personal safety. The article also includes recent stats from Sandia Heights Security, which reported 45 calls in April 2020, related to alarms, suspicious activity, theft, and vandalism. Additional services offered by the SHHA, include emergency alerts via email, member offers like tram passes, copies, safety vests, and notary services. The ACC Chair, Bob Bower, instructs new homeowners to report any home emergencies immediately to SHHA to prevent further damages. Homeowners are also advised to hire only licensed and insured contractors for repairs or modifications to their homes. The article also includes approved ACC projects and advice on attracting hummingbirds, a common bird in New Mexico. Moreover, the pandemic has led to the cancellation of the Sandia Heights “Cork & Fork” dining activity. SHHA member Hugh Prather lauded Keith Julian's article in the May issue of The Grit for its insightful dive into post Columbian history, while updates and corrections to The Grit can be found on the SHHA's website.
