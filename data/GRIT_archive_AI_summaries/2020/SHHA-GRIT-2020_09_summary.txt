The SHHA in Albuquerque, managed by President Woody Farber, Vice President Susan McCasland, Secretary Travis Rich, Treasurer Cheryl Iverson, and several board and committee members, urgently needs volunteers for the Covenant Support Committee (CSC) to maintain community aesthetics and property value. The community is being reminded of updates and revisions to the 2021 SHHA Resident Guide and Directory deadline on November 6, the importance of voter registration by October 6, and the six general obligation bond questions for the local election on the November 3 ballot. There are hunting allowances in the Cibola National Forest, rules addressing light pollution in Sandia Heights and specific details regarding a recent covenant violation filed by a homeowner. Sandia Heights Security provides support and contact information for county ordinance violations. The document provides information about utility faults and emergencies, member benefits, and the importance of community involvement in property upkeep. The community, also host to Albert G. Simms Park, urges residents to participate in facilities maintenance and renovation activities. Details about Albuquerque's history, community events, corrections to the GRIT printed version, and the annual photo contest for resident amateur photographers are highlighted. The SHHA office will be closed on Labor Day, and a community meet will be held on September 26, with pandemic precautions in place.
