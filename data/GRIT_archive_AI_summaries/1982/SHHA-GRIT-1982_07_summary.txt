The Sandia Heights Security Guards operate around ninety hours weekly, with increased hours during weekdays, all evenings, and extended hours on the weekends. As the area and the number of subscribing residences grow, the operational hours will expand accordingly. A secondary contact number, 243 9888, is available for use during non service hours if calls to 765 9832 go unanswered. Calls will be suitably routed, with emergencies promptly reported to the right authorities and non emergent calls allowing message leaving for the guard's attention upon their return. The Homeowners' Association is strictly enforcing violation restrictions, leading to several ongoing cases handled by the Association's lawyer. All property owners are urged to abide by these restrictions for smooth co existence. The second annual Sandia Heights Arts, Crafts, and Gifts Bazaar is planned for Sunday, November 14, at the local fire station, with a portion of the proceeds benefiting the volunteer fire district. The Bazaar includes a raffle featuring a Kevin Red Star Lithograph, kindly donated by Flora Ferrari, with raffle tickets priced at a dollar each, and the profits going to the fire service. A note is also made about the list of the 1982 Board Members for the Sandia Heights Homeowners' Association, alongside their contact information and tenure. A reminder is issued for residents to adhere to the speed limit of 25 MPH, with a suggested 15 to 20 MPH on specific roads.
