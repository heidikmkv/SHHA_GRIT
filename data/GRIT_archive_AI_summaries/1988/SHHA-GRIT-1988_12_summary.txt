In December 1988, an architectural control committee led by Mark Bryant was assigned to safeguard specific subdivisions within Sandia Heights including Sandia Heights Addition (Lots L 40), Sandia Heights South (Units 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 25, 27A and 28A). Meanwhile, other subdivisions remained under the control of the Sandia Peak Tram Company. Key highlights in the community included: Prevailing speeding concerns, with requests from locals for mindful driving, especially due to children commuting on roadsides. Successful execution of a holiday bazaar to support Fire District #5, suggesting recurrent future events. Ongoing dispute over 9,000 acres land claim by Sandia Mountain Coalition (SMC); waiting for decision amidst consistent policymaker engagement and financial management of legal costs through donations. Enthusiastic anticipation for a Sandia Heights Homeowners Association event on December 15 at Rob Freeman's residence. Nominations for the homeowners association's board directors for 1988, with discordant references to order requests made to 'Bled NE' for an unknown item costing $430 per dozen shipped to Albuquerque, uncertain allusions to December 1988 and January 1989, and obscure finale comprising a unique identifier: 'PoReT Ne 373 ALBUQUERQUE, NN a7IS4002'.
