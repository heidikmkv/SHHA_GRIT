The SHHA will host its annual meeting on Saturday, June 4 at the Paseo del Norte Fire House. Discussion topics will include interests, advice, complaints, future suggestions, direct inquiries to board members, and the retirement of five board members who will present on their committees' yearly progress. Additionally, talks on the Sandia Pueblo's claim over 9,840 acres of Sandia Mountain's west face will be covered. This claim is currently disputed by the Department of Agriculture, lawyers representing homeowners, and the Secretary of Agriculture, indicating significant ecological and legal effects. The area is also host to unique flora, prompting efforts to maintain it under U.S. Forest Service management against the Sandia Indian Pueblo claim. A critical health advisory has been issued due to an infected rodent discovery in Sandia Heights South. Meanwhile, local parks and recreation solicit volunteers for various projects and community events continue in the region, including "Jogger Be Aware", bridge marathons, holiday bazaars, social gatherings and an upcoming SHAA Spring Fling. Infrastructure projects, board elections, conservation efforts, and volunteer opportunities are all topics set to be covered. Local services include babysitting, home care, pet sitting, errand running, can collection, a potential new Boy Scout Troop establishment. Advertisements and notices include donation requests, child care provision, playgroup participation, and sales of items like toys, encyclopedias, and a 1978 King's Highway RV. The Association also introduces the state representative candidate for district 31, Kip Nicely, who outlines his support for the Homeowners Association and encourages votes. In closing, all homeowners are reminded of the SHAA Directory's upcoming distribution in July, with changes encouraged through calls to the designated individuals. SHAA's "The Grit" issue is distributed six times a year exclusively to members, except the May issue which goes to all homeowners.
