The Board of Directors at SHHA, including business and military executives, lawyers, a pilot, and a realtor, dedicates countless hours of volunteer service for community administration and implements their combined experience of over 500 years. Notable tasks undertaken include handling lawsuits against covenant violators, addressing land claims, negotiating with various realty companies, assessing water company administration and rate hike requests. Additionally, the board is taking steps to rewrite outdated bylaws, regulate architectural constructions, attend county and state meetings, devise a covenant compliance system, organize community events, improve amenities, and monitor construction in the neighborhood. Furthermore, the board is addressing community concerns such as potential environmental contamination from proposed school development, traffic flow changes resulting from roadway expansion, and improving response times for local fire and emergency services. The community is also grappling with the issue of crime, and despite the excellent service of local authorities, budget and resource limitations necessitate a vigilant community and the possible formation of a "neighborhood watch". Regular community communications are also managed with updates about trash collection, board member statuses, service announcements, and local business features provided in the GRIT publication. Engagement initiatives include advertising opportunities, flea markets, and various service offerings from community residents. Issues related to local flora, including the unique succession of plants and wildflowers and recommended resources for further education, are also highlighted. Social events, including bridge gatherings, are promoted to boost community interaction. Finally, the board and local fire authorities are addressing a serious issue of fire hydrant obstructions by community residents, asserting the critical need for clear, accessible hydrants for safety and legal reasons. Community theatrical performances, opportunities for contributing to the GRIT, and the organization of a Communications Committee are also outlined.
