The SHHA and the Sandia Peak Tram Company share a long standing relationship dating back to the 1960s. SHHA's responsibilities include enforcing aesthetic covenants, encouraging community interaction, and exploring improved services. Concurrently, SHHA contracts the tram company for certain duties, which initially led to confusion but has been beneficial thanks to the company's infrastructure and free services. With the tram company ending its free service provisions, SHHA is currently planning how to transition and manage these changes, with the assistance of legal experts. * The New Mexico Symphony Guild's Home Tour will take place at Sandia Heights, featuring a party at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Don Franterhouse on May 1st, and the home tour on May 5th. * The Sandia Heights Homeowners Intervention Committee remains positive despite criticism regarding their fund solicitation approach from the Sandia Peak Utility Company and continues striving for efficient and fair water service. * The Sheriff's Department encourages dialing 911 promptly during emergencies. * A series of community events will be held at the homes of Maria Ratner, Eileen Ryan, and Maryann Syroid. * Residents are recommended to maintain their natural surroundings by managing local vegetation responsibly. * Services like briefings, manuscript/document writing, and 24 hour availability are available from ATA Inc.
