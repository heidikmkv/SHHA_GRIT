In 1988, the Sandia Heights Utility Corporation proposed a water rate increase which was met with strong opposition by homeowners at a home association meeting, citing a number of reasons for their resistance. The SHHA took immediate action, with homeowners calling for funds allocation in order to intervene professionally. Sandia Peak Utility Company justified the increase with claims of operating at a loss and needing an additional $134,266 in revenue for effective operation. Key points of the situation include: Despite similarities in delivery costs, the proposed increase meant water bills in Sandia would be 198% higher than in Albuquerque based on average water usage of 8229 gallons. A committee was formed by the SHHA to address the issue, requiring more funds for a successful intervention in audits, rate adjustment, and service quality maintenance. To support this, a $30 voluntary contribution from each member or homeowner was requested, to be placed in a legal and accounting escrow to back the intervention. If there is any leftover after all SHHA funded interventions, it will be refunded. The urgency comes from the potential communal bill increase of at least $134,266 annually due to the proposed rate increase. Contributions can be sent to Sandia Heights Homeowners Association in Albuquerque, with any questions directed to either the Intervention Committee or the SHHA Board. Members are also encouraged to garner support within their local community.
