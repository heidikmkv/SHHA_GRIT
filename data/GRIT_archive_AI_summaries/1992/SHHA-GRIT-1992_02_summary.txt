SHHA has grappled with ongoing community concerns. These include the controversial decision of Bernalillo County to keep Eagle Ridge Lane open, resulting in increased traffic, potential late night unauthorized access, suspected vehicle racing, and a rise in crime rates. The move conflicts with SHHA's initial hiatus plan following Tramway Blvd's construction in 1991. However, according to County Public Works Director, Mr. Jha Ramsey, the road is essential for emergency access and meeting specific neighborhood requirements. Other issues involve local development. One case involves a new residential subdivision conditionally approved by the county's Planning Commission, which developer Don Morgan aims to appeal two of the conditions set. In another case, developer Vern Hagen proposed a new subdivision with 32 building units on a seven acre tract. While the unit density was accepted, concerns arose about transitioning from current half acre lots to smaller ones. In terms of community activities and initiatives, resident Max Sanches proposed a communal initiative for the Tramway Landscape Project, aimed at revamping the community area through engagement. SHHA also heads a recycling initiative inviting citizen volunteers. Among other matters is the neighborhood's annual meeting and Spring Fling Picnic, with board elections also planned. This event also accommodates a range of local businesses showcasing their services. Committees within SHHA are keen on preserving the aesthetics of the Sandia Heights' architectural design, with significant emphasis on screening equipment to blend with existing housing components. Approved plants for landscaping include various sages, with the Sandia Heights Wildflower Club providing resources for local gardeners. Emergent community needs consist of the Homeowners Referral Program, providing community members with access to professional services. However, specific areas still need referrals, with residents encouraged to recommend experienced professionals. Crime prevention and neighborhood support, particularly around Simms Park Road and Unit 18 due to the gate closure, have sparked concerns about safety and accessible emergency routes. Lastly, SHHA has expressed interest in introducing new categories for the best decorated subdivision in their annual events.
