The 1992 SHHA successfully hosted the Annual Member Meeting and Spring Fling picnic with over 235 attendees. Activities included children's games, a hang gliding competition, prize drawings, face painting, and hot air balloon rides. Event feedback revealed a majority of members supported the maintenance of the park through association dues, while opposing the idea of a County park. The SHHA plans to lower association dues allocation, seek alternative funding sources and implement cost saving strategies. Sampling tests for the New Mexico Health and Environment Department confirmed that Sandia Height wells and groundwater are free from unregulated contaminants. Residents are urged to respect each other's privacy to prevent trespassing and vandalism. The Architectural Review Committee has seen a surge in business, reminding residents of the 30 day review period for renovation projects. Many residents have reported stucco related house damages, to which STO offers specialized repair materials, water proofers, and elastomeric acrylic finishes as solutions. The annual Holiday Craft Bazaar is set to take place on Sunday, October 15, featuring local artists from Sandia Heights or North Albuquerque Acres. SHHA is dealing with several home issues such as deteriorating walls and exterior aesthetics. Two new subdivisions are under the Sandia Heights Master Plan with mandatory membership policies for residents. The association plans to impose stricter restrictions to avoid covenant violations and reduce high legal costs. They also offer mediation services for non covenant related disputes. To improve cost controls and reporting, SHHA has started to budget by “cost centers”. This step allows board members to monitor spending and effectively allocate resources. The Government Liaison Committee successfully mitigated the impact of the Tramway Blvd expansion and local area development. They were able to achieve elevation redesigns, modified construction, and better drainage systems. Parking restrictions were also enforced on narrow streets to ensure public safety. The committee closely monitors ongoing developments including the new High Desert area and works with local authorities on potential funding proposals and landscape plans. The SHHA Board of Directors handled a surge of architectural submissions due to lower interest rates, reviewing plans for new homes and additions. Sandia Peak Tram Co. showed interest in handing over architectural reviews for their Unit 20 to SHHA. A successful recycling initiative resulted in additional funds for community improvement projects. Lastly, "Sandia Heights' Viva LaDiferenda" t shirts continue to sell amongst community members, being the highlight of events like the Spring Fling picnic and the Holiday Craft Bazaar.
