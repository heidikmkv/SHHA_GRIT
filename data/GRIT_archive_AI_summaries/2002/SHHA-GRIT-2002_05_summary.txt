The SHHA had its annual 2002 meeting, where members voted for the Board of Directors and discussed key topics like Bylaw revisions and Sandia Mountain Resolution. Committees reported on several achievements: The Traffic & Safety Committee proposed adding traffic signs and speed humps, maintaining trimmed vegetation for roads, and creating natural pathways within the county right of way. They're also working with the Sheriff's office to increase security. The Architectural Control Committee showed a high approval rate for architectural change requests, emphasizing their commitment to preserving Sandia Heights' character. The Parks, New Development, & Government Relations Committee improved pedestrian safety and beautified the area by planting new trees. The Committee Operating Procedures were developed for smoother operation. The Community Service and Membership Committee (CSMC) has been fostering relationships with the Pueblo of Sandia and aiming to create a more representative Board of Directors. The text also discussed creating a butterfly habitat, maintaining plants, and choosing suitable flowering plants. The Covenant Support Committee (CSC) handled 67 complaints and changed their approach by directly contacting the violators. This led to a reduction in active violations. Other details involve the election for the SHH Board of Directors and a list of candidates with their aims. Tips for garden maintenance, a list of what's blooming in July, and the importance of water conservation were also covered. Efforts were made to increase community participation by soliciting articles from Sandia Heights residents. The cost of print publications and website maintenance was offset through advertising revenue. The upcoming Sandia Heights Wildflower Club's Annual Garden Walk and SHHA Board of Directors meetings were mentioned, encouraging residents to participate. The SHHA website's enhancement was also discussed, asking residents to contribute by writing articles or creating material for the site.
