During their meeting on February 13, 2002, the SHHA Board of Directors decided to adopt a neutral stance on the Pueblo of Sandia Boundary Dispute. This marked a shift from their earlier position, as they had previously financially supported a group against the agreed settlement between the Pueblo of Sandia, the United States, and the Tram Company. The Board now advocates for elected officials to pursue a satisfactory resolution and to avoid directing this dispute back to court. While the complexity of the dispute roots back to the Spanish domination era, SHHA had shown opposition in the past by supporting groups against the settlement and publishing articles suggesting their disapproval of it. To avoid further misunderstanding, a timeline of events was created for a clearer historical insight into the situation. The decision to pass the resolution is to express neutrality and promote a swift resolution to prevent any future legal issues.
