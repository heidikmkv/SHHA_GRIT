The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association board, comprised of a diverse range of individuals, works diligently to enhance the community through organizing events, providing unique services, solving covenant control issues, and maintaining relationships with businesses like the Tree Company. They also continuously seek homeowner input. In other news, the U.S. Forest Service is planning to open a trail from Simms Park to the Sandia Mountain Wilderness to create more outdoor activity opportunities, with volunteer spots open for individuals interested in preservation efforts. Simultaneously, the Homeowners Association is running a phone survey to determine the neighborhood's interest in securing natural gas service. The results will guide the Gas Company's decision about service provision. If you're keen on this service but haven't been surveyed, please contact Randal. Remember to adhere to outdoor activity safety guidelines, listed below, recommended by the New Mexico Emergency Services Council: Always inform a responsible party about your trip details. Donâ€™t deviate from your pre planned route without notification. Avoid traveling alone. Check weather conditions with the U.S. Weather Service and locals. Dress appropriately for likely conditions and carry vital supplies such as food, map, compass, etc. In case you become lost, stay put and create a signal fire. If you're seriously delayed, notify the State Police ASAP. Lastly, the Homeowners Association reminds everone that firing air guns is strictly forbidden and potentially dangerous. Feedback for improvement of Homeowners Association services is always appreciated.
