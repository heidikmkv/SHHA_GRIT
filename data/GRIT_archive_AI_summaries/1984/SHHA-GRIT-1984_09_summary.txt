This is the annual contribution request for the Sandia Heights Residents Association, with key updates and events outlined as follows: The list of newly elected directors from this year's general meeting and August's directors' election is included. An attached financial report provides details for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1984. Updated bylaws now feature two major amendments: the introduction of active/contributing and inactive membership categories, with only active members holding voting rights, and the expansion of the Board of Directors from seven to fifteen members. This amplifies the Sandia Heights area representation and activity. Membership contributions for the 1984/1985 term will commence from July 1, 1984. Active members paying the thirty dollars membership fee will gain voting rights and benefits including a tram area parking permit and a Sandia Heights resident directory. Non paying members, while devoid of decision making rights, still contribute to community maintenance costs. On November 9th at 16:00, Rab Freeman or Muffy will host an event at 131 Big Horn Ridge Court. All neighbors are invited and asked to confirm their attendance at 258 2977. Future gatherings will be announced in the neighborhood newsletter. A neighborhood mothers' group seeks support to enhance the children's play area; their initiative will be detailed in the October newsletter along with a questionnaire to solicit resident feedback. To fund more community initiatives, residents are encouraged to send their dues in the enclosed envelope to PO Box 20021, Albuquerque, Net 97154 0021.
