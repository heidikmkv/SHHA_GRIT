The SHHA, formed in 1984, seeks to improve the living conditions for residents in Sandia Heights, Bernalillo, New Mexico. Key objectives for 1984 1985 include broadening membership, improving certain routes, launching a resident directory, and finding ways to clear financial obligations. The association also plans to collaborate with neighboring associations, engage residents through events like bike races, and ensure the district's upkeep. Two county commissioner candidates, Pat Cassidy and Don Fuchs, propose improvement plans for Tramway Boulevard, in response to the increase in traffic and community growth. The community also faces concerns like driveway erosion, harmful liquid disposal, and violations like unauthorized parking and antenna installations. Cub Scout Den #11 is appreciated for their cleanliness efforts. Suggestions include using yellow light bulbs to reduce glare, and adherence to the Christmas decoration contest rules, which is limited to association members. The community park facilities are deemed inadequate, with proposed improvements including safer, age appropriate equipment, and shelter, among others. Success relies on financial community support and a survey will gather residents' opinions. A babysitting community also exists, and there is mention of an educational institution catering to a broad age range with additional services and amenities.
