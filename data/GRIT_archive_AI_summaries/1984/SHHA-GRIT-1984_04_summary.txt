In a correspondence issued to the Sandia Heights Homeownersâ€™ Association (SHHA) members: A "Meet the Candidates Meeting" has been scheduled for May 5, 1984; followed by an SHHA general meeting and elections on June 2, 1984. Traffic issues on Tramway Boulevard have been discussed, along with the purpose of the SHA and the identification of new SHHA Committee Chairs. Unregistered members are encouraged to register by April 24th to vote in the June 5th Primary. Changes in the SHHA by laws have been proposed: Expansion of the Board of Directors from seven to between fourteen and sixteen members. Voting rights restricted to dues paying members. Inactive board members to leave automatically. Further legitimization of the non profit status of SHHA. A disputed land swap between the Tram Company, the Forest Service, and the City was talked about: The trade involves the 160 acre La Cueva land for the 325 350 acre Rounds Estate for developing a suitable area. Concerns raised include potential damage to La Cueva's natural resources and a conflict of interests. Regarding traffic on Tramway Boulevard: The problem is escalating due to residential and commercial developments, making current conditions hazardous. The need for road extension presents a future challenge. SHHA has urged members to: Increase their participation and contribute dues to help with neighborhood improvements, covenant enforcement, and community cohesion. Have more financial support to safeguard homeowners' interests and improve the living environment. The SHHA spends a significant proportion of the budget on maintenance tasks, including snow and ice removal and playground upkeep. Long range planning committee: Led by Bill Jackson, focusses on Tramway Boulevard's development. The committee frequently reports on public meetings, city transportation gatherings, and county planning commission sessions. In community matters: Homeowners are reminded to adhere to water pressure regulations. Sports programs, like the Sandia Heights Swim Team, are organized for Four Seasons members. A caretaker is needed for a three month old baby and a teenager seeks employment in odd jobs. Lastly, Wendland Beezhold continues to serve as the Board President and details of a foreign language announcement relating to board activities remain unclear due to language barriers.
