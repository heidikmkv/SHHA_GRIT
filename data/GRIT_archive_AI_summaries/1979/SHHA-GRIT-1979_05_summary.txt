In 1979, the Sandia Heights Security Patrol, backed by substantial resident support, extended its operational hours to roughly 65 hours per week, focusing primarily on weekend nights. Continued contributions from residents were encouraged to augment and ameliorate service. For enhanced child safety, motorized traffic was prohibited from the ballfield/playground area, and residents were asked to advocate for maintenance priorities for Trasway Blvd. with county officials. The Sandia Heights Homeowners Association scheduled an annual meeting on May 12, 1979, with discussions on topics like annual solicitations for contributions and playground issues, and voting for filling two board seats. The residents were informed about an upcoming annual cleanup day and requested for voluntary dues to help install a grass and watering system in the playground. The Sandia Heights Swim team announced the commencement of its season the following month under new coach Livy Parsons, a highly qualified professional. Residents were advised to observe caution while driving in the vicinity to avoid accidents involving children.
